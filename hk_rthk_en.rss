    Fish-allergic children may eat some fish: CUHK study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University on Tuesday said they have developed a ladder system to help children with fish allergies reintroduce the food into their diet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The researchers said that between 2016 and 2021, they studied 249 children with fish allergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of them were found to be allergic to the protein β-parvalbumin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said some types of dark fish, such as salmon and tuna, have lower levels of the protein in them compared to fresh fish, such as tilapia and catfish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the researchers, Agnes Leung, said she hopes the ladder system can help children with allergies eat some kinds of fish, because the food has nutrients that can't be found elsewhere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fish has very unique nutritional properties, for example, Omega 3 fatty acids are unique to fish, they help a growing child's brain development," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said they found that around 30 percent of the children in the study were not allergic to shellfish, such as shrimp and crab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major allergen in fish is parvalbumin, but the major allergen in shellfish is tropomyosin, so they are fundamentally different," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For a lot of fish-allergic patients, they could in fact tolerate shellfish without developing allergic reactions."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thirty Hong Kong secondary school students will attend a young astronaut training camp on the mainland later this month, to get a taste of the country's space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their nine-day trip includes stops in Beijing, as well as space facilities in Jiuquan, Gansu province, and Wenchang in Hainan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Space Museum said it's the first time the Jiuquan satellite launch centre will open to a Hong Kong delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students will get to put on spacesuits, make and fly rocket models and may get to meet actual astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the students were picked from a pool of 200 applicants, who were nominated by their schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Form two student Law Shun-yan is among those heading to the mainland and said he's very interested in the country's space development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very proud of China's space development. I want to become a space scientist or even an astronaut," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope to share what I experience in Jiuquan and Wenchang with others in Hong Kong, so that they get to know more about space, so we can study in this field together in future and contribute to our motherland's aerospace industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony before the students headed off, Chief Secretary Eric Chan described the students as new blood for the SAR's integration into the country's development plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international innovation and technological centre, Hong Kong surely has its responsibility to contribute what we can to the country's space missions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan thanked mainland authorities and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the camp, for their support.

    'HK firms should invest in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) says companies in the SAR should look for investment opportunities in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Edmund Lo, an economist at HKTDC, on Tuesday said investors should look out for green investments in Vietnam as this aligns with national policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another economist at the council, Henry Cheung, said Laos is looking for infrastructure investments to develop logistics, while Cambodia has several focuses ranging from digital infrastructure to being a logistics hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irina Fan, director of research at HKTDC, said investors should look at both demand and national policies when determining business trends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most important thing is to look for trade activities because when the trade activity moves up to a certain level, it will trigger investment activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They (Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia) would also like to diversify from what they are doing, so this is a time where they would need investment support, they would need solution support."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nongfu Spring lashed out at the Consumer Council on Tuesday, accusing the watchdog of affecting its reputation by making what is said were biased comments towards its water content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company demanded an apology and clarification from the watchdog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council was following up on a lawyer's letter issued by Nongfu Spring, a day after the watchdog revealed its test results on 30 bottled water brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring said the watchdog wrongly categorised its product, applied an incorrect testing standard, and claimed the findings were misleading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed the council's findings caused panic among Hong Kong and mainland consumers, and had caused "massive" damage to its brand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring stressed it would take further action unless the watchdog apologised and clarified its test results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council confirmed it had received a letter issued by Nongfu Spring's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It maintained its analysis showed all samples of bottled water it tested were safe to drink.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten students have achieved perfect scores in this year's university entrance exams, up from four last year, while an overwhelming majority of Diploma of Secondary Education (DSE) exam candidates passed the new citizenship and social development subject.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority on Tuesday said eight male and two female pupils got a perfect 5** across six subjects and earned "attained" in the new citizenship subject that replaced liberal studies, with eight of them also acing an extended mathematics module.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top scorers are among more than 49,000 DSE exam candidates who will receive their results on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 17,600 daytime secondary school pupils, or roughly 43 percent, met the minimum requirement needed for a publicly-funded university place, known as "332A22".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means scoring at least level 3 in both Chinese and English, level 2 in maths, and “attained” in the citizenship and social development subject, as well as level 2 in two electives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said 94.1 percent of candidates sitting the new subject achieved an "attained" level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wei Xiangdong, the authority's secretary general, said the introduction of the subject, graded with “attained” or “unattained”, was not a factor when it came to the increase in top-performing students this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think it makes it easier to gain so many 5**, because all the other subjects, their assessment criteria did not change, and we used standard referencing every year. It should be equally difficult or easy to get 5** in other subjects," Wei said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricardo Mak, the director of public examinations, stressed that a number of overseas institutions recognise the new subject, including world-renowned universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Cambridge University, Simon Fraser University in Canada and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore also require students to have the ‘attained’ level in this subject to be admitted to their academic programmes,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams authority also said it’s highly concerned that question-and-answer booklet content had been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, a move which resulted in a woman’s arrest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said the incident did not affect the confidentiality of the exam questions, as such content was posted online after the tests had taken place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exams body added there are no plans right now to significantly expand the number of testing sites across the border after holding the exams at two centres in the Greater Bay Area this year.

    Almost six percent of Hongkongers have iron deficiency

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health officials say iron deficiency is more common in women. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761824_1_20240716172905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six percent of Hongkongers suffer from iron deficiency, according to a Department of Health study.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, the department said it arrived at the figure after research involving 2,000 people aged between 15 and 84.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that iron deficiency, which can cause tiredness among other things, is more prevalent among girls and women, with 17.5 percent of those between 15 and 49 suffering from the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[With] regular menstruation there is blood loss, with blood loss there is iron loss, therefore women of reproductive age have higher iron requirements and are more prone to iron deficiency,” said Dr Rita Ho, head of the department's non-communicable disease branch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said 10.6 percent of females aged 15 to 49 have the more serious problem of iron deficiency anaemia, which can cause further health issues including fatigue and shortness of breath. Only 0.3 percent of males have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures are similar to those in other high income places, such as Canada and the United States, the department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said people can increase their iron intake by eating fish, eggs and beans, as well as up to 500 grammes of red meat per week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department advised against iron supplements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is enough iron absorption [from meals] and the iron supplement is not necessary. There is too much iron in the supplements, there may be gastrointestinal side symptoms such as constipation,” Ho said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people were killed and multiple others were wounded in a shooting near a Shiite mosque in Oman's capital Muscat, police said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The shooting was a rare event in the otherwise stable sultanate, which has a Muslim-majority population, including a small minority of Shiites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said Pakistanis were among the wounded, but the numbers had yet to be confirmed, according to Islamabad's embassy in Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's ambassador to Oman, Imran Ali, visited some of the wounded in the hospital, the embassy posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert following the shooting and cancelled all visa appointments Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "US citizens should remain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities," the embassy wrote on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While several mosque attacks have roiled the Arab Gulf region in recent years, the incident on Tuesday is unprecedented for Oman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 2015 suicide attack on a Shiite mosque in Kuwait killed at least 27 worshippers and wounded more than 200 others. It was claimed by the Islamic State group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same year, Saudi Arabia saw two attacks on Shiite mosques in the span of one week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB called for better road maintenance in Central and Western District to address concerns regarding uneven roads, cracked pavements, and loose and sunken paving bricks which affects the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The DAB recently inspected roads in the district and identified more than 200 spots with poor pedestrian or traffic conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said repairs in the past were fixed with poor quality paving material because it was quick and convenient. However, many repairs were damaged over time due to tree root growth, vehicles driving, and heavy trucks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have continuously reported to the Highways Department to do emergency repairs, however, the material they are using is not durable...it may only last a few days after they do repair work," said District Councillor Rex Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislative Councillor Chan Hok-fung called for a re-evaluation of the quality of asphalt used for emergency repairs and the strengthening of inspections so that work could happen as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said while bigger repairs may come with disruptions, they were necessary to ensure the durability and longevity of new roads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It may take over a month to do the whole repair work [for Caine Road]. If we could show the public that after the complete maintenance work is done, it may last for a few years, even though it may cause a bit of inconvenience.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Henan province on Tuesday issued an orange alert for rainstorm, the second-highest level in the country's four-tier weather warning system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From Monday to Tuesday morning, heavy downpours lashed many parts of the province, with a maximum precipitation of 638.5mm recorded in Sheqi County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The province's meteorological observatory has forecast heavy rain to fall in some areas till 9am on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's northern regions are bracing for extreme weather conditions. According to a meeting held on Monday by authorities including the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, the main rain belt is expected to move northwards in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will bring heavy rainfall to the Sichuan Basin and the Huanghuai region, encompassing parts of several provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management has ordered relevant provincial-level regions to focus on vulnerable areas, including flood-prone rivers and urban drainage systems. (Xinhua)

    HK swimming body to share review findings on rules

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's swimming governing body will announce the findings of a review of its rules within this year after a recent controversy on competition qualifications, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under fire after initially barring a nine-year-old swimmer from competing due to his club's low ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The young swimmer is now allowed to join the championships in an individual capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said sports associations should take a pragmatic approach in reviewing their rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On resource allocation and organisation of competitions, each association is required to draw up their own rules. We also believe that this is the right approach," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But if problems are identified, then a pragmatic approach should be taken in resolving these issues. Discussions are necessary to consider all options on enhancing the mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that the swimming body, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China and other representatives will have a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he will lead a delegation to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia later this month to explore business opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation will include professionals from the trade, legal, commerce, logistics and innovation sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Asean is Hong Kong's second largest trade partner and a huge emerging market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We attach importance to our cooperation with these countries... I will talk to the business sectors and the political circles about what Hong Kong can bring to them, opportunities in various areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to get their support for Hong Kong to join RCEP [Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership] so that Hong Kong can be a super connector and super value adder."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee announced the start of a public consultation exercise for his next policy address, adding that his team will attend more than 40 sessions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the sessions will focus on improving the economy and people's livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an open economy. We are affected by external uncertainties, say for example geopolitical tension, high interest rates, as well as challenges from different fronts. So we need to maximise our possibilities and opportunities," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Thomas Müller has called time on his 14-year international career after their European Championship exit, the Bayern Munich forward said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old featured in his eighth and last tournament on July 5, in Germany's 2-1 quarter-final defeat by Spain, where he was brought on as a substitute in the 80th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Müller helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup and has the third most appearances for the national team with 131 caps and 45 goals. He also won the Golden Boot and Young Player Award during the 2010 World Cup, when Germany finished third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It always made me very proud to play for my country. We celebrated together and sometimes shed a tear together," Müller said in a farewell video on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I had the privilege of making my first international appearance, I would never have dreamed of all this. I would like to say thank you to all the fans and my Germany teammates for their support over the years. Take the enthusiasm and joy of this year's Euros with you." (Reuters)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761747_1_20240716082151.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chaotic scenes at the Copa America final have raised serious questions for the organisers of the 2026 World Cup which will be held in North America.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The start of Sunday's final between Colombia and Argentina at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium was delayed by 82 minutes as overwhelmed security struggled to process the safe entry fans into the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers blamed ticketless fans for rushing the entry points into the venue for their decision to keep the gates closed for almost three hours after the planned opening time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, while there was plenty of evidence of ticketless fans entering, it was also clear that the security system was unable to cope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some fans needed medical attention for heat exhaustion after being stuck in the crush around the fencing at the entrance to the 65,000 capacity venue amid alarming scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hard Rock Stadium will host seven games at the 2026 World Cup which the USA is co-hosting with Mexico and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Copa America was organised by South American confederation CONMEBOL while the World Cup will be controlled by global governing body FIFA and it's local organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not a good look," said former USA international Alexi Lalas, now a leading television pundit for Fox Sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand this is not a good look for CONMEBOL and this is also, because it is happening on our watch, in our country, not a good look for the US less than two years out from the World Cup," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA, who had no role in the running of the Copa, did not immediately comment on the incidents but sources indicated they would now intensify discussions with stadiums over their security plans. (AFP)

    Trump picks Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as running mate

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump won formal nomination on Monday as the Republican presidential candidate and picked a right-wing loyalist for running mate, kicking off a triumphalist party convention in the wake of last weekend's failed assassination attempt.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trump announced 39-year-old Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as his vice presidential pick, rewarding a one-time harsh critic who became one of his most reliable - and uncompromising - supporters in Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, 78, is guaranteed a hero's welcome at the convention in Milwaukee, where delegates delivered their formal nomination two days after the scandal-plagued former president survived an assassination attempt at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN," Trump posted on Truth Social.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vance had been widely expected as Trump's pick. He will bolster the ticket on the right wing, but with less chance of expanding appeal to more moderate voters and women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standard-bearer for a new kind of populism that has come to the fore under Trump, Vance is also one of the least experienced VP picks in modern history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he embraces the ex-president's isolationist, anti-immigration America First movement. Vance is further to the right than his new boss on many issues including abortion, where he embraces calls for federal legislation. (AFP)

 Thousands of people in Madrid welcomed Spain's squad home on Monday after they beat England to win Euro 2024.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After receptions with King Felipe VI and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, La Roja were paraded through the capital city on an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was adorned with the message "it's only the beginning" and the trophy sat at the front of the bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want a lot," Sanchez said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want more," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The likes of Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Sunday's match-winner in Berlin, Mikel Oyarzabal, wore white t-shirts with the number four on them in reference to the record number of times Spain have won the European Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For now, we're not realising yet what we have accomplished," Williams said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacker, who scored the opening goal of the 2-1 victory, was also eager to thank Spain's fans "for the love and warmth they brought the team".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team bus took them to Plaza Cibeles in central Madrid where thousands more fans waited to celebrate the success, following on from victories in 1964, 2008 and 2012. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a car bombing at a cafe in Somalia's capital Mogadishu that was packed with football fans watching the the Euro 2024 final has risen to nine, security sources said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Witnesses described scenes of panic and chaos after the powerful blast late on Sunday, with people scrambling for safety and the main entrance to the cafe destroyed by the blaze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mohamed Yusuf, an official from the national security agency, said nine civilians were killed and 20 others wounded in the explosion, raising the official toll of five given by police late on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The popular Top Coffee restaurant, which is located near the presidential palace in the centre of the city, was thronged with young men watching the final that Spain won 2-1 against England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were many people inside the restaurant, most of them youth who were watching the football match... but thanks to God, most of them made their way out safely after using ladders to climb up and jump over the backside perimeter wall," Yusuf said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the state-run Somali National News Agency said Sunday it was carried out by Al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab jihadists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images posted online showed a huge fireball and plumes of smoke billowing into the night sky as the explosion ripped through the cafe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was inside the restaurant watching the football match when I heard a huge explosion, there was smoke, dust and fire at the front side of the restaurant and we panicked," Said Muktar said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I and several other people rushed towards the main entrance, but it was completely inaccessible," he said, adding that the "whole situation was chaos".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Images of the aftermath of the bombing on Monday showed piles of rubble where the restaurant once stood and several burnt-out vehicles, as local residents inspected the scene. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Florida judge appointed by Donald Trump has dismissed the criminal case against the former US president on charges of mishandling top secret documents, saying the way that Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed was improper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision is a huge victory for Trump, who had been accused of endangering national security by holding onto top secret documents after leaving the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judge Aileen Cannon made her ruling after lawyers for the 78-year-old argued for a partial stay of proceedings to allow for an assessment of a Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former President Trump's Motion to Dismiss Indictment Based on the Unlawful Appointment and Funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith is GRANTED," Aileen wrote in her order.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Superseding Indictment is DISMISSED because Special Counsel Smith's appointment violates the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Trump is set to be annointed as his party's champion at the Republican National Convention, days after surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the Florida case, Trump was facing 31 counts of "willful retention of national defense information," each punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also faced charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and making false statements. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 34-year-old man, allegedly linked to the suspected murder of a Chinese woman in Thailand, was arrested in Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yan Ruimin, a 38-year-old influencer, went missing during her solo trip to Thailand and is suspected to have been dismembered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect allegedly fled to Macau after the woman's death and tried to pawn a fake watch at a shop last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the shop staff were suspicious and reported him to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers eventually caught him at the Taipa Ferry Terminal and handed him over to mainland police on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the investigation, Macau police were informed by mainland authorities that the suspect could be hiding in Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After checking his identity, it was confirmed that he was the suspect in the murder case.

    'Consider inflation when setting public housing rents'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Winnie Ho says the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761682_1_20240715175648.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday called on the government to take into account inflation and the cost of living when reviewing public housing rents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The calls came after the Housing Authority proposed raising rents by 10 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If approved, the increases would take effect in October with a three-month exemption period for most tenants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Edward Lau said the government should consider how much rent tenants can afford, as the city's economic recovery after the pandemic has been sluggish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Yang Wing-kit said the exemption period suggests a need to revamp the way rent increases are decided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Out of the past eight inspections, including this one, there have been four times when the Housing Authority provided some form of exemption or deferment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the entire mechanism is working well, you wouldn't need to specifically provide exemptions or delay payments. At this point, I think we need to consider whether the mechanisms in the current regulations require a review or optimisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said the authorities should not casually make changes to the way public housing rent increases are worked out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is one thing needed to be very cautious about inflationary factors. Because when we incorporate them, we should consider the actual affordability of each tenant. Inflation goes hand in hand with deflation," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, in a deflationary period, the reduction in wages may be less than the decrease in prices. This could result in a situation where you have to reduce wages and increase rent. These are sensitive situations, and we should not make changes to our mechanisms casually."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent.

    Girl whose heart stopped had no underlying illness: HA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Girl whose heart stopped had no underlying illness: HA" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761670_2_20240715171809.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Monday said that a girl who suffered a cardiac arrest while getting stitches at a hospital didn’t have any underlying illnesses, after tests on her were negative.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Sum-yuet, who’s now five, went to Yan Chai Hospital in late May to treat a head wound, but while getting stitches, her heart stopped beating for nearly 20 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She remains in critical condition in intensive care at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her father had accused medical staff of pushing her head down on a pillow during the procedure, something that was denied by the HA, which said her head was tilted sideways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After meeting with the girl’s family, the HA’s chief executive, Tony Ko, again apologised over the matter, saying the gesture was needed since the “unfortunate incident” took place at a public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he wouldn’t say whether human error was involved, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko stressed he wouldn’t go into details over exactly what went wrong, but an expert review of child care guidelines recommended checking patient vitals and consider using sedatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, when doing such procedures, [the expert panel recommended] how to better communicate with the patients and the relatives, how to closely monitor the patients, as well as in suitable cases when we need to introduce procedural sedation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[The panel is] not investigating the case, so mainly the purpose is to review our present guidelines to see which are the areas that we need to further emphasise and remind our colleagues to pay particular attention.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA chief admitted the guidelines wouldn’t clearly list out all scenarios, such as whether sedation was needed in each case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials discussed with frontline staff on ways to raise the overall safety of child patients, and the recommendations would be passed on to staff again later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said two medical staff involved in the girl’s treatment were transferred to non-clinical positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko said officials would do their best to provide medical care to the girl as well as give necessary support to her family.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Terminal Expo will be held in Hong Kong this November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The expo will feature conferences, awards and forums centred on celebrating and introducing aviation technology advancements, as well as facilitating discussions about urban air mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael Duck, executive vice president of Informa Market, said multiple sectors, from banking to restaurants, stand to benefit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong has been chosen for the expo because it is right at the centre as the biggest growth area for aviation in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This (expo) is very important to show to everyone within the region that the place to meet the most amount of people in the shortest amount of time, is here in Hong Kong," Duck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vivian Cheung, acting chief executive of the Airport Authority, said Chek Lap Kok has already made good use of new technology, from the third runway and facial recognition for passengers, to automated vehicles to carry luggage.

    'Housing estates to be more accessible for elderly'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Monday spoke at the Accessible for All @ Hong Kong Symposium about making residential areas more accessible for the elderly and disabled people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a third of Hong Kong's population will be 65 or above in around 20 years from now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elderly citizens living in older estates may not have as many aids, such as handlebars, that help them move around easily. Ho spoke about plans to install handles and assistance bars in commonly frequented areas at housing estates such as bathrooms, by the elevators, and in hallways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In our residential estate design, accessibility is of the utmost importance...it is very important for us to make it convenient for [the elderly] to be mobile."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho mentioned other ideas to make areas around residences more accessible, citing hopes to build more bridges and lifts to accommodate those who live in hilly parts of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linda Lam, chairperson of the Equal Opportunities Commission, stressed the importance of creating a universally accessible society, especially as Hong Kong's population ages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Accessible, barrier-free environments and facilities are the prerequisites for people with disabilities to participate equally in society," said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As our population ages, the demand for such facilities becomes increasingly urgent."

    Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beware of suspicious pop-up alerts: police" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761644_1_20240715141143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday warned people to watch out for suspicious pop-up alerts on their computers, to avoid falling prey to "technical support" scams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said 12 cases were recorded in the past two months, with total losses amounting to more than HK$17 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said scammers send false system alerts to computers and pretend to be law enforcement agencies, before asking victims to call technical support and transfer money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Baron Chan from the force's cyber security and technology crime bureau said victims are usually foreigners and English speakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Nowadays, the operation systems that we are using in most of our computers are Western-based. The language we use is mostly English, so that's why the scammers purport the scam alerts, they are mostly using English,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 70-year-old retiree, who gave her name as May, said she lost around HK$10 million to fraudsters who posed as police officers and technical personnel at Apple.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The alert seemed urgent and official and being accompanied by ongoing loud noise and flashing colours on the screen. It was a relief to be offered a solution to a computer security threat, so I called the number,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan advised people to install antivirus software and avoid calling any technical hotlines, adding that the force is taking steps to block such pop-up advertisements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If your computer displays some alert message, especially in full screen, you can try to press and hold the escape key on your keyboard or press control, alternate, delete at the same time to open the task manager to close the message, or even restart your computer to try to close the problematic pop-up windows,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday advised people to opt for boiled tap water instead of bottled water.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During hot summer days, people tend to lose water more easily, and staying hydrated becomes crucial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consumer watchdog tested 30 bottled water brands, including mineral water and distilled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings revealed that tap water contained a higher mineral content than mineralised purified water and distilled water with added minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also discovered that the price of tap water was around 2,700 times lower than that of bottled water, as a litre of tap water costs around $0.00262 while distilled and purified drinking water costs HK$7.02 per litre on average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said tap water is a more eco-friendly and affordable option for consumers, compared to bottled water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously our tap water, after you boiled it, it is much more economical, much more friendly, especially from an environmental protection point of view. Every bottle when you produce, you know, you're polluting the environment. Every bottle that you consumed, you are creating harm to the current environment as well as the next generation,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that all bottled water it tested passed its safety tests.

    Indoor playhouses urged to ensure facilities are safe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Consumer Council says indoor playhouse operators should ensure their terms and conditions are clearly stated. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761629_1_20240715115159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The consumer watchdog on Monday called on indoor playhouse operators to ensure the design and layout of their facilities are safe, and to clearly list out terms and conditions to avoid disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council said it had received a complaint about a child suffering a forearm dislocation and a wrist fracture from a fall while navigating a rope tunnel at a playhouse, and that a request for a refund and compensation was initially met with "ambiguous responses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The venue involved only proposed compensation of HK$3,000 after the watchdog stepped in, but the child's parent had yet to accept the offer and was considering legal action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The council would like to remind the industry that indoor playhouses must follow stringent safety standards in terms of game design and venue layout. They should also properly assess and mitigate any safety risks and provide sufficient safety measures to participants to ensure a positive experience for both parents and children," the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complaints included a toddler playgroup centre providing unclear terms and conditions to use complimentary playtime offered alongside a course enrolment, and another members-only indoor playhouse resetting a customer's account balance to zero without prior notice upon the expiry of the one-year membership period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The terms and conditions of use should be clearly stated, and flexible pricing policies are recommended to manage expectations and minimise disputes between traders and users," the watchdog said.

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

    Police meet with retail trade to address theft

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they recently met with some 40 retail industry representatives to work on ways to prevent theft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the force recorded around 37,000 cases of theft between January and May this year, which represented a three percent increase from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them, there were 3,678 cases of shoplifting, a 12 percent year-on-year increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities arrested 1,750 people in total, of which around 150 of them were caught on suspicion of making repeated attempts at shoplifting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was suspected to have shoplifted five times during the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most common age group to commit shoplifting were those between 41 and 50 years of age, followed by those aged between 51 and 60 years. Police said there was no distinction between gender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mong Kok, Tsuen Wan and Tseung Kwan O were the areas that recorded the largest numbers of shoplifting cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common shoplifted items included pharmaceutical products, shampoo and razors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wine and chocolate were the main targets from November to January each year, while fruit and ice cream were most popular during summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The largest case involved two bottles of wine priced at around HK$130,000. The force said there was no fixed price range of stolen products, as shoplifters mainly act out of a sudden urge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They don't steal the items for the values of them. They don't need the items, they don't need the money," police clinical psychologist Michael Fung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In one study, more than 48 percent of them committed shoplifting because of their personal loss, psychological loss in recent times. It could be losing their spouse, their loved ones, their job, or mobility or health. That somehow triggered their depression or negative feelings, negative mood, [and] they need to find a way to cope with that.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have offered security suggestions for the retail sector, such as allocating more staff to assist customers, arranging for security guards in plain-clothes to patrol shop floors, and upgrading surveillance cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police noted that shoplifters look the same as ordinary customers, but there are a few ways to identify potential thieves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, [shoplifters] wear extraordinarily big clothing during very hot seasons, as it is easy for them to put stolen property into their clothes and just walk out, or bringing extraordinarily big bags that are empty at first... these might be hints they want to do something,” chief inspector Kelly Choi, who works on crime prevention, said.

    HKUMed adopts generative AI literacy into curriculum

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The HKU faculty of medicine will offer a generative AI literary series as a course to facilitate and enhance teaching and learning, through various multimedia methods.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department has developed a simulation education system called KASES to imitate real-life patient scenarios and an app that helps classify X-rays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of their disciplines or year of study, students can use these virtual systems with information compiled and validated by professors to practice the process of clinical reasoning and history taking. This particularly benefits first-year medical students who are not yet able to attend clinicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical Associate Professor and Director of Educational Technology Dr Gary Lau explained the need for AI literacy in the medical field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our future healthcare professionals must understand not only the potentials of generative AI but also the ethical issues, potential legal aspects, and professional considerations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While AI offers new opportunities for learning, Lau stressed the importance of not becoming over dependent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Teaching can not be purely replaced by AI. It will enhance our teaching, but the interaction of our students with real life patients is highly invaluable and cannot be replaced."

    'Treat DSE results day as a learning opportunity'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Students will be receiving their DSE results on July 17. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761605_1_20240715100208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist said students who do not receive an ideal grade on their DSE exams should not feel discouraged, and instead treat the experience as a learning opportunity to build resilience.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Students will be receiving their results on Wednesday and Dr Martina Cheung, from Castle Peak Hospital, said results day is a chance for students to build stress-coping techniques in the face of a challenge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that students can use the "MANGO" technique to train their psychological muscle in accepting undesirable results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said the M stands for meaning and purpose in which students can treat the experience as a learning opportunity, while A, for acceptance, encourages students to accept the results rather than to question it. She said the N for nurture pushes students to take care of their bodies and practise mindfulness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "G is for gratitude and generosity because some research show that if a person can have gratitude, it's better for their mood so they can think about what they can feel grateful, and also it's important to be generous to others because by helping others, one can focus on others rather than themselves. The research shows that it can reduce the anxiety and also the depressive symptoms," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last one is optimism. By having some positive visualisation of the future, it can improve the mood of the students and also when a person has better mood, they can have broader perspective and also can have better creativity to think about how to solve the problems."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung stressed that parents should ask how their child would like to be supported during these times, and give them the space and freedom to process the results.

    'Cool it down,' Biden says after assassination attempt

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden sought to calm a divided nation after his rival Donald Trump survived an assassination bid, saying in a rare Oval Office address on Sunday it was time to lower the temperature of America's hostile politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "You know, the political record in this country has gotten very heated. It's time to cool it down," Biden said in the televised speech, just the third he has given from behind the historic Resolute Desk during his presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the country reeled from images of a bloodied Trump waving his fist after a gunman opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania, Biden added that US politics "must never be a literal battlefield, a, God forbid, a killing field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old Democrat said that both sides had a responsibility to ease the situation ahead of a deeply divided election that would now be a "time of testing" for the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators said that they were still probing the motives of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot dead by snipers at the event in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after firing multiple shots with a legally-bought semi-automatic rifle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former president Trump said on social media on Sunday that Americans should not allow "evil to win," adding it was "more important than ever that we stand United." (AFP)

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun is looking to take part in his second Olympics next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clinched gold in men's single sculls in the lightweight category of the World Rowing Cup in May, which involved athletes weighing no more than 72.5 kilogrammes. Now, he's taking on a whole new challenge by participating in the open category in the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu told RTHK he's adopting a new strategy that he believes will better prepare him against the "real giants".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The civil defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said Sunday that 15 people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering war displaced where the Israeli military said it had targeted "terrorists".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike on the UN-run Abu Araban site in central Gaza's Nuseirat camp was the fifth on a school-turned-shelter in eight days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Abu Araban school was housing "thousands of displaced people," civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said, adding that most of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools in Nuseirat were the target for two of the earlier school strikes as Israel keeps up its offensive against Hamas Palestinian militants who triggered the war with their October 7 attack on Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its air force "struck a number of terrorists who were operating in the area of UNRWA's Abu Araban school building in Nuseirat".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the building had "served as a hideout" and base for "attacks" on Israeli troops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel says Hamas uses schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure for military purposes. Hamas denies the accusation. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina captain Lionel Messi hopes forward Angel Di Maria ends his international career with a goal in Sunday's Copa America final against Colombia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Di Maria, 36, announced in November his plans to retire from internationals after representing his country for 15 years and Messi wants him to get his name on the scoresheet as he did against Brazil to clinch the continental title in 2021 and against France as they won the 2022 World Cup final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe he'll score another goal in the final like he did in all the previous ones he's played in. It would be extraordinary," Messi said in an interview with Direct TV Sports, adding that the team still hopes he will reverse his decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We always tell him that if everything goes well, we have playoff games coming up. Nevertheless, 'Fideo' (Di Maria) has made up his mind and there's nothing that can change it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Di Maria has scored 31 goals in 144 appearances for Argentina, having played in six Copa Americas and four World Cups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also struck the winner in Argentina's 1-0 victory over Nigeria to win Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. (Reuters)

    Kenya police say 8 bodies found in Nairobi dumpsite

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Onlookers gather at the dumpsite where six bodies were found in the landfill in Mukuru slum, Nairobi. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761558_1_20240714185003.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight female bodies have been recovered so far from a dumpsite in a Nairobi slum, Kenyan police said on Sunday, adding that they were pursuing possible links to cults, serial killers or rogue medical practitioners.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gruesome discoveries of mutilated and dismembered bodies dumped in plastic bags in a rubbish tip in Mukuru in the south of the Kenyan capital have horrified and angered the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya's acting national police chief Douglas Kanja said the first six corpses were found on Friday and more body parts were retrieved on Saturday, with preliminary investigations revealing that all were female.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were severely dismembered in different states of decomposition and left in sacks," Kanja told a press conference, adding that investigations were ongoing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kanja also called for public cooperation in "so that we bring the perpetrators of these heinous acts to book".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amin Mohammed, the head of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, said the ages of the victims ranged between about 18 to 30 and that all had been killed and butchered in the same manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police were looking into a number of hypotheses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Are we dealing with a cult that is associated with criminal activities, are we dealing with serial killers," he said at the press briefing alongside Kanja.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We even could be dealing with rogue medical practitioners [involved in] criminal activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenya was left reeling last year by the discovery of mass graves in a forest near the Indian Ocean coast containing the bodies of more than 400 members of a doomsday sect, one of the world's worst cult-related massacres. (AFP)

    Alcaraz dominates Djokovic to retain Wimbledon crown

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz overpowered seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets to retain his Wimbledon title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Spanish third seed produced a performance combining awesome power with delicate touch to win 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), collecting the fourth Grand Slam of his young career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz equals the Open Era record for most Grand Slams won at the age 21 or under, joining Boris Becker, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And he is just the sixth man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, who had knee surgery just weeks ago, was aiming to win a 25th Grand Slam - which would have been a record in the men's and women's game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he had no answers in the Centre Court sunshine as the electric Alcaraz pounded him from the back of the court and treated the crowd to an array of his trademark drop shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it is a dream for me winning this trophy," said the Spaniard. "I did an interview when I was 11 and I said my dream is to win Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me this is the most beautiful tournament, the most beautiful court and the most beautiful trophy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz paid tribute to his beaten opponent, who only found his range in the third set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Djokovic is an unbelievable fighter, I knew he was going to have his chances," said Alcaraz who had needed five sets to defeat the Serb in the 2023 final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was difficult but I tried to stay calm going into the tie-break and tried to play my best tennis. I was glad at the end I could find the solutions."(AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slammed South Korean "scum" on Sunday for launching anti-regime propaganda leaflets across the border via balloon, warning they would pay "a very high price".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Korean peninsula has seen tit-for-tat balloon campaigns in recent weeks, with Pyongyang floating trash-filled balloons southward in protest of ones carrying propaganda leaflets sent northward by South Korean activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kim Yo Jong, a key regime spokesperson, said she was informed the latest batch of "dirty leaflets and things of the ROK scum" had been found in North Korean territory along the border, according to a statement carried in English by the official Korean Central News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ROK is an abbreviation of South Korea's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korean military personnel were "now making an all-out search, throwing into fire and disposing of the found rubbishes", she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the ROK scum are not stopping this crude and dirty play," she added, using the initials of the North's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ROK clans will be tired from suffering a bitter embarrassment and must be ready for paying a very high price."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pyongyang has already sent more than a thousand balloons carrying trash southward in what it says is retaliation for balloons carrying propaganda criticising Kim Jong Un's rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Seoul has fully suspended a tension-reducing military deal and restarted some propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers along the border. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="France's President Emmanuel Macron speaks with his wife Brigitte Macron during the Bastille Day military parade along the Avenue Foch in Paris. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761553_1_20240714182159.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The French armed forces will take an unusual detour at the start of their annual Bastille Day march on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations to host the Olympic Games blocked the national day parade from its traditional route on the Champs Elysees, and a smaller military contingent will instead march on the nearby Avenue Foch - one of the most prestigious streets in Paris and one of the most expensive addresses in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All eyes will be on the host, President Emmanuel Macron, who last year cut a more impressive figure, hosting rising superpower India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi at France's triumphant national day parade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, with the Olympics just around the corner, France has no international star guest for this year's parade - and French political leaders' minds will be elsewhere, pondering the power vacuum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This month's snap elections, called by Macron to clarify France's direction after the far right sent shock-waves through the political establishment by coming first in European polls, left the country without a ruling minority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against this backdrop, the reduced and rerouted parade risks becoming a new symbol of drift, even with the addition of the arrival in Paris of the Olympic Torch, ahead of the July 26 to August 11 Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No tank or armoured vehicle will take part, and only 4,000 foot soldiers will march, down from 6,500 last year, but the military fly-past will see 45 aeroplanes and 22 helicopters soar over Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regiments honoured on the parade will include those from France's allies and former French colonies that took part in the country's 1944 World War II liberation 80 years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The parade's final section will also honour the Olympic spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>

  <br/>
  In an Instagram post, the swimmer said he spent more than three hours on the last seven kilometres due to the current.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also wrote: "not fast but once again my fat is proven life-saving – average water temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, but I am sure most of it was 11 degrees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who used the challenge to raise funds for charities supporting grassroots youth development, thanked his fans for all their support.

    Hydrogen bus makes maiden cross-harbour trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A double-decker hydrogen bus made its maiden cross harbour journey on Sunday, with route 170 passing through three toll tunnels, including Aberdeen Tunnel, Cross Harbour Tunnel and Lion Rock Tunnel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Richard Hall, the managing director of Citybus, said the company aims to phase out diesel buses in the next few years with plans of operating a full fleet of zero-emission buses by 2045. He said the company plans to purchase a large number of electric buses and bring in at least five hydrogen buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By running those vehicles in parallel, we have a greater volume. We will be able to get more data that will enable our future design and purchasing decisions. In terms of fares, fares have to rise on an ongoing basis. Fares are critical to supporting the sustainability of our operations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Fares ensure that our employees, citizens of Hong Kong... can meet their cost of living and continue to keep pace with inflation. Fare increases also allows us to invest in new technology, improving our bus operations and delivering a great solution to all the citizens of Hong Kong that they can be proud of."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hall said their fleet composition in the future will compose of 70 percent hydrogen buses and 30 percent electric buses. He also said that Hong Kong would be put at the forefront of international and technological development for new energy solutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some people were already queuing at Wah Fu Bus Terminus at around 6am to board the first scheduled bus of the day. A man surnamed Wong said he is worried about travelling through tunnels in a hydrogen bus given that it is flammable, but he said he believes the company had undergone many tests before its release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Diesel buses run on diesel so it releases a lot of exhaust smoke, and the bus is pretty loud when it is running. The hydrogen bus is a lot quieter and you can only hear the sound of the air conditioning. It is quiet inside and out," said another passenger surnamed Yau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Sunday said the government has received an overwhelming response for the light public housing programme, receiving nearly 10,000 applications for flats under the project.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The housing minister noted that the administration received over 9,600 applications for the first batch of some 4,400 units located in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok, which will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants for these units must have been on the waiting list for conventional public housing for at least three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on a social media post, Ho urged eligible people to submit their applications regardless, saying that even if they do not get a unit this time, they will be prioritised in future rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also mentioned that she had visited the community in Tsuen Wan on Saturday to explain details of the programme to those who are interested, and reassured them not to worry about adjusting to a new living environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have visited people who only ever lived in the urban area and had never lived in the New Territories. They initially moved to Yuen Long with great trepidation. However, within a week or two, they found that adapting was surprisingly easy,” she wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The priority application period for the scheme closes on Monday.

    'Timeframe for anti-child abuse bill reasonable'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during a 18-month period to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761525_1_20240714170919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Sunday said it is reasonable for a newly passed law to make reporting of child abuse mandatory to come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Sun said given the complexity and scale of the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill – which requires certain professionals to report to the authorities when they suspect serious child abuse cases – a year and a half is a reasonable timeframe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand that this involves 25 different professions and there are over 100,000 people involved. There’s a lot to work on,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what needs to be done? First, we need to create detailed guidelines. We need to train these 100,000 people and make sure they understand. On the other hand, we need to prepare for the aftermath. We expect an increase in reported cases, so that we need to have enough staff, facilities, and emergency resources. Everything needs to be in place before we can proceed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added the administration will provide 96 extra foster beds during the 18-month period, which will be used to temporarily accommodate about 300 abused children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding the Social Workers Registration Board, which saw seven of eight elected members of the current term resign, Sun said he is confident that other social workers would be willing to join the board when the next election takes place at the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the TVB interview, the minister also said he did not think it was too harsh to permanently revoke the licences of social workers who have been convicted of national security offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that it does not mean the administration is not giving a second chance to social workers who have committed other crimes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our judgement is the mainstream view of the society and the Legislative Council, is that social workers who have committed crimes against national security are out of the question. This is a lifetime suspension arrangement. But for social workers who have committed other crimes, I want to be very clear, we are very tolerant, as long as the circumstances allow and everyone thinks it's appropriate, they can still be social workers."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that public secondary school exam results due this Wednesday should not define the future of candidates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said regardless of the results, young people can find and develop their own future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation nowadays are rebuilding different industries around the world, as well as our lifestyles," Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So long as young people embrace changes, dare to imagine and keep learning, and are determined to move forward, they can surely break new ground and develop their own future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also noted that there are ups and downs in life, and people should persevere through success and failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that the government has been promoting development in innovation and a diverse economy, with the hopes of providing more quality jobs for young people, while enhancing the economy's development, momentum and resilience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Civil service minister Ingrid Yeung, for her part, said public exam results are not everything in life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said for those who intend to serve the public, they can try to learn more about jobs that the government offers as early as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can be a step quicker than others and plan your career, equip yourself for the future," she wrote on social media.

    Taxi fare hikes come into force

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New taxi fares went into effect on Sunday with the flagfall of red urban taxis increasing from HK$27 to HK$29, but some passengers say it is not the right time to raise prices, which also went up for green and blue taxis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For green New Territories taxis, flagfall went from HK$23.5 to HK$25.5, while the fares went up HK$2 for blue Lantau taxis to HK$24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After flagfall, the incremental charges for each 200 metres travelled under first-tier rates have also gone from HK$1.9 to HK$2.1 for urban taxis and from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9 for New Territories and Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second-tier distance charges are up from HK$1.3 to HK$1.4 for urban and New Territories taxis, and from HK$1.5 to HK$1.6 for Lantau taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Ko told RTHK that now is not the right time to be increasing fares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy isn't doing well right now, and suddenly they are increasing the fare by so much. The fares keep going higher and higher. Taxi drivers actually told me they don't want the fares to go up. They said if the fares go up, so does the rental costs for their vehicles so they don't really profit from this," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman, surnamed Cheung, said she does not mind the fare increase, but hopes that taxi services can improve. She said some cabs smelt of cigarette smoke and drivers had been rude to her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Tong said people who take taxis frequently will not mind the fare increase, adding that he has had good experiences with taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a taxi driver surnamed Choi estimated that the fare increase could earn him HK$5 to HK$10 more for every HK$100. He said he does not think business will take a hit because of the fare hike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some people rely on taxis like those who are in a hurry or people who are immobile. I don't think they will mind that extra dollar or two," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said on Sunday that officials will not set a cap for booking fees for future taxi fleets, which they hope will hit the streets by the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is set to give out five licences for these fleets this month, which it hopes can provide high quality taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether passengers will find booking fees troublesome, the minister said people are familiar with online car-hailing services, and that booking charges will be something that will be left up to the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We won't be setting a maximum booking fee level. We believe the market will make adjustments. Of course, we hope that the fleets and the users will come up with their own reasonable amount in this regard," Lam said on a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the taxi fleets must provide online car-hailing services, adding the Transport Department will be providing links on its website to their platforms and mobile apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said that taxi fleets will be given the freedom to design the looks and logos of their vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the government – which will carry out a year-long study on passenger demand and how their needs are changing – plans to regulate online car-hailing services by issuing licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the administration's study does not take the price of taxi licences into consideration, adding that officials have the overall public interest in mind, and stressed that the government wants to maintain a highly efficient public transport system.

    Trump safe after shots fired at rally: Secret Service

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secret Service said former president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the bangs rang out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X, and his campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. (AFP)

    UK's Labour party to focus on 'turbo charging growth'

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761499_1_20240714060120.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's incoming Labour government will focus on measures to "turbo charge growth" when it unveils its legislative plans at next week's King's Speech, prime minister Keir Starmer said in comments released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "From energy, to planning, to unbreakable fiscal rules, my government is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth that will create wealth in every corner of the UK," said Starmer, whose party won a huge landslide earlier this month, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our work is urgent. There is no time to waste. We are hitting the ground running by bringing forward the laws we will need to rebuild our country for the long-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The task of national renewal will not be easy... but the legislation set out at the King's Speech will build on the momentum of our first days in office and make a difference to the lives of working people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charles III will deliver the King's Speech on Wednesday, as parliament formally reopens after the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite its name, the address is not written by the monarch but by the government which uses it to detail the laws it proposes to make over the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it was working on more than 35 bills "to deliver an ambitious parliamentary session that will be built on a bedrock of economic security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include measures to enforce public spending rules and others to prevent a repeat of the utility bill price hikes that triggered the UK's recent cost-of-living crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislation will also flesh out announcements already made this week, such as the launching of a fund to draw investment into the UK and of a body tasked with boosting clean power by 2030, as well as the opening of recruitment for a new border security command. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure of the US political left, on Saturday threw his support behind Joe Biden's White House campaign, dismissing calls for the president to withdraw from the race over health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Enough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate," independent senator Sanders wrote in a New York Times column, adding that "it's time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders's column comes amid steadily growing calls from Democratic officials and donors for the 81-year-old Biden to step aside following a disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump. So far, some 20 members of Congress have called for him to leave the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls taken since the debate show Trump with a national lead over Biden, though within the margin of error. They also show some key battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, shifting in the Republican's favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a majority of Americans – including Democrats – believe Biden is too old to serve again, according to a recent poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president did not help his own cause when, at a summit in Washington earlier this week, he mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, however, insisted during an appearance on Friday that he is, and will remain, his party's flagbearer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am running and we're going to win," he told an enthusiastic audience in Detroit, amid chants of "Don't you quit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down her support for Biden, calling him a "fighter" at a campaign event on Saturday in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where Trump is also holding a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, we will continue to fight. We will continue to organise. And in November, we will win," said Harris, who some pundits have speculated could lead the Democratic ticket if Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seeking to allay concerns, Biden spoke with members of the Democratic Party's left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus in a virtual meeting on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will also sit for interviews next week with NBC News and Black Entertainment Television (BET).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders, who at 82 is himself seeking reelection to the Senate in November, did acknowledge the signs of the president's aging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But given Biden's achievements – and the record of Trump, "who has 34 felony convictions and... has told thousands of documented lies" – the senator brushed Biden's shortcomings aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, I know," he wrote. "Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump. But this I also know: A presidential election is not an entertainment contest. It does not begin or end with a 90-minute debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed the eruption of anti-Biden rhetoric partly on "the corporate media (which) has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders also blamed those Democrats who he said had "joined that circular firing squad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He challenged the president to do more – to "propose and fight for a bold agenda" that would help lift working families "who have been left behind for far too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden, he concluded, was "a good and decent Democratic president with a record of real accomplishment," including helping rebuild the US economy and shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win." (AFP)

    Baldwin thanks supporters after early end to trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alec Baldwin made his first public comments to thank his supporters on Saturday after the stunning early end to his involuntary manslaughter trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now," Baldwin said in a brief Instagram post that accompanied a photo of him sitting in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom. “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor wept a day earlier when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case three days into the trial and said he could not be criminally charged again in the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Neither he nor his lawyers spoke to reporters as he left the courthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence that sank the case was ammunition that was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged they “buried” it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge said the withholding of the evidence tainted the “fundamental fairness” of the trial of the 66-year-old Baldwin, who could have gotten 18 months in prison if he were convicted. (AP)

    Death toll in Gaza camp 'safe zone' strike rises to 90

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel had declared Al-Mawasi a "safe zone" as it pushed into Rafah near the Egyptian border, but on Saturday Palestinians raced to collect dozens of casualties from the military's latest strike.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sirens wailed and women screamed as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What have they done? they're children, children," one woman cried. "Seven-year-old and 12-year-old children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had sought refuge, was left a chaos-strewn wasteland by one of the deadliest Israeli strikes since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least 90 people were killed, half of them women and children. It said another 300 people were wounded in the "massacre".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attack in the Khan Younis area had targeted Hamas military strategist Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, but there was "no certainty that the two were eliminated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located near the city of Khan Younis, Al-Mawasi was designated a humanitarian area after Israel in May ordered civilians to evacuate from other parts of the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been warning for months that there is no safe place for anyone in Gaza amid Israel's military bombardment," said UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, which operates health sites in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said hundreds of thousands of displaced people were sheltering in the "safe zone," which had been targeted before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black smoke billowed behind a wide, ash-strewn street in Al-Mawasi where bodies lay in pools of blood, some covered by sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men struggling to carry the wounded wove through those beyond help to reach ambulances waiting with open doors. Others were piled onto donkey-pulled carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who have lost limbs everywhere. It's a scene the mind cannot even imagine," Mahmoud Chahine said near a market struck in the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Nasser Hospital reportedly saying it was at full capacity, ambulances kept arriving, carting in the wounded on orange stretchers, including a man with a towel tied around his leg as a makeshift tourniquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman outside the hospital could be heard pleading: "Please enough, enough for God's sake."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said the attack against Deif "struck an open area" that "was not a tent complex but an operational compound."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our information, only Hamas terrorists were present and there were no civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Netanyahu's office, he had discussed the strike with security and military officials as part of his goal "to eliminate senior Hamas officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called the claim that Deif had been targeted "false allegations" intended "to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre" in Al-Mawasi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said heavy fire was preventing its teams from reaching the "many bodies" scattered in the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmoud Abu Akar, an eyewitness, described repeated missiles raining down on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time people tried to get close to rescue others, they would strike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no warning at all, it happened all of a sudden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since telling people to relocate to Al-Mawasi in May, the Israeli military has been accused of repeatedly striking the area in deadly attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June the International Committee of the Red Cross said 22 people were killed by shelling that damaged its office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Returning from the Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said children had suffered life-changing injuries and people were angry there was no reprieve from the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no safety here, no matter where people go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's strike came on the 281st day of the war that was unleashed by Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which resulted in 1,195 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military reprisal has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry. (AFP)

 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his government had "no certainty" that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in a strike that officials in Hamas-run Gaza said killed dozens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israel attacked Gaza today in an attempt to eliminate Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Rafa Salama," Netanyahu told a press conference hours after the attack on Al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone in Gaza's south sheltering displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no certainty that the two were eliminated," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 71 people were killed and nearly 300 wounded in the strike on Al-Mawasi, near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had designated the area a safe zone and told civilians in other areas in Gaza to go there for safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu described Deif, head of the Hamas military wing, as "the planner and leader" of the October 7 attack that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring back all hostages from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The elimination of the heads of Hamas advances the achievement of all our objectives," said the right-wing premier who faces mounting opposition to the conduct of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent weeks, we have identified clear cracks within Hamas," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's operation also contributes to this, regardless of what its outcomes will be." (AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled rugby world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)
