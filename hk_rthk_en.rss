<div class="itemFullText">
 Planes were gradually taking off again on Saturday after global airlines, banks and media were thrown into turmoil by one of the biggest IT crashes in recent years, caused by an update to an antivirus programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Airport Authority said most systems are operating normally again, but contingency plans remain in place, and mainland state media said Beijing's airports had not been affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passenger crowds had swelled at airports on Friday as dozens of flights were cancelled after an update to a programme operating on Microsoft Windows crashed systems worldwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday, officials said the situation had returned virtually to normal in airports across Germany and France, as Paris prepared to welcome millions for the Olympic Games starting on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Multiple US airlines and airports across Asia said they had resumed operations, with check-in services restored in Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand, and mostly back to normal in India, Indonesia and at Singapore's Changi Airport as of Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft estimated Saturday that 8.5 million Windows devices were affected in the global IT crash, adding that the number amounted to less than one percent of all Windows machines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services", it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Microsoft said the issue began at 1900 GMT on Thursday, affecting Windows users running the CrowdStrike Falcon cybersecurity software.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Saturday blog post, CrowdStrike said it had released an update on Thursday night that had caused a system crash and the infamous "blue screen of death" fatal error message.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said it had rolled out a fix for the problem, and the company's boss, George Kurtz, told US news channel CNBC he wanted to "personally apologise to every organisation, every group and every person who has been impacted".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company also said it could take a few days for things to fully get back to normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's National Health Service was hobbled by the crash on Friday, preventing doctors from accessing patient records and booking appointments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "majority of systems... are now coming back online in most areas, however they are still running slightly slower than usual", an NHS spokesperson said, warning of disruption continuing into next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media companies were also hit, with Britain's Sky News saying the glitch had ended its Friday morning news broadcasts. Australia's ABC also reported major difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian, British and German authorities warned of an increase in scam and phishing attempts following the outage, including people offering to help reboot computers and asking for personal information or credit card details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks in Kenya and Ukraine reported issues with their digital services, some mobile phone carriers were disrupted and customer services in a number of companies went down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of this outage is unprecedented, and will no doubt go down in history," said Junade Ali of Britain's Institution of Engineering and Technology, adding that the last incident approaching the same scale was in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some airports halted all flights, in others airline staff resorted to manual check-ins for passengers, leading to long lines and frustrated travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thousands of US flights were grounded, although airlines later said they were re-establishing their services and working through the backlog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior US administration official said Friday that "our understanding is that flight operations have resumed across the country, although some congestion remains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  India's largest airline Indigo said Saturday that operations had been "resolved", adding in a statement on X that the process of resuming normal operations would "extend into the weekend".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Low-cost carrier AirAsia said it was still trying to get back online and had been "working around the clock towards recovering its departure control systems".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike said the issue was "not the result of or related to a cyberattack". (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 at 10.40 pm, as the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remains rather loose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tropical depression is expected to strengthen slightly and adopt a more northwesterly track. It is now centred about 710 kilometres of Hong Kong and may still affect us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Standby Signal No 1 will remain in force at least until 5 pm. The Observatory will this evening assess the need for a higher warning signal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with it and the southwest monsoon are covering the central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast, the tropical cyclone will intensify and gradually take a more northwesterly track, moving in the general direction of Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under its influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later tomorrow. There will be swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.

    Horschel leads Open one shot ahead of chasing pack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Billy Horschel goes into the final day at Royal Troon just one shot in front. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762497_1_20240721041942.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American Billy Horschel leads the British Open at four under par heading into Sunday's final round after torrential rain and a swirling wind at Royal Troon blew the challenge for the Claret Jug wide open.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Horschel leads by one from a group of six, featuring USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, South Africa's Thriston Lawrence and Americans Sam Burns and Russell Henley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler is just one shot further back at two under after battling to an even par round of 71.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A total of 12 players are within four shots of the lead for what promises to be a fascinating final round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight leader Shane Lowry had a day to forget as the 2019 champion crumbled in the sodden conditions to collapse from eight under par after seven holes to one under by the end of his round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Horschel was one of the big movers in a round that had allowed for lower scoring earlier in the day before the wind and rain picked up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting at two under, Horschel produced a sublime four-under 32 on the front nine thanks to birdies at four, six, seven and nine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bogey followed at 11 before another dropped shot at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brown, ranked 272 in the world, had been set to lead heading into the final round until a double bogey at the last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he and Rose remain in the hunt to become the first English winner since Nick Faldo in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry began the day with a two-shot lead and extended that to three with a birdie at the par-five fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Irishman's round began to come off the rails with a double bogey at the 130-yard Postage Stamp eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worse was to come as five bogeys in eight holes on the back nine dropped Lowry back into ninth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fresh from his maiden major win at the USPGA, Schauffele is eyeing another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three moved to five under at one stage before bogeys at 11 and 18 knocked him back to three under after a round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll let myself dream tonight," said Schauffele.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler is also right in the mix to win his third major and win for a seventh time in 15 starts this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A birdie at the third got the American off to a fine start but he then played the next 13 holes in two over before picking up a shot at the 17th to remain ominously poised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The back nine, I think that was probably the hardest nine holes that I'll ever play," said Scheffler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence, Burns and Henley made the most of the benign early morning conditions to shoot through the pack to three under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawrence and Burns posted six-under 65s, while Henley made 66 to move into contention before the leaders had to face the worst of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two-time major champion Justin Thomas and former Masters winner Adam Scott also impressed to move to level par and remain on the fringes of the battle for the Claret Jug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the challenge from the big names on the breakaway Liv circuit failed to materialise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jon Rahm slipped back to two over, while Brooks Koepka is back at eight over after a 78.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the loudest cheers of the week so far was reserved for Kim Si-woo after he produced the longest hole-in-one in British Open history on the 17th that brought him back to five over for the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was not doing very well, and then I was feeling terrible for my shots the last couple days. Then finally I got the best golf shot I've ever had this week," said the South Korean. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal reached his first final since winning the 2022 French Open, defeating Croatian qualifier Duje Ajdukovic in a three-set tussle in Bastad on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A day after his four-hour quarter-final victory, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was again tested to the limit by Ajdukovic, the world number 130 who had won just two tour-level matches before this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard rebounded from dropping the opening set to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, returning to the final of a tournament he won as a teenager in 2005.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal will play Portuguese seventh seed Nuno Borges or Argentina's Thiago Agustin Tirante on Sunday as he goes in search of the 93rd singles title of his career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His most recent triumph came two years ago at Roland Garros, when he won the tournament for a record-extending 14th time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal is using the event in Bastad as a tune-up for the Paris Olympics, where the tennis will be played on the clay at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old returned to action this week for the first time since losing in the first round of the French Open in late May. (AFP)

    Pogacar wins fifth stage on Tour as victory nears

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762491_1_20240721013834.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall leader Tadej Pogacar won for a fifth time on this Tour de France on Saturday, moving to the brink of a third title, as defending champion Jonas Vingegaard came second and Remco Evenepoel dropped around a minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With just Sunday's concluding time trial to come, two-time champion Pogacar has a five minute 14-second lead over Vingegaard as he effectively made sure of becoming the first man in 26 years to capture the Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double in the same season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day's action culminated on the tough Col de Couillole climb where Evenepoel attacked Vingegaard in an attempt to take second place overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead he himself dropped around 53sec on the Dane, making it less likely the Belgian can claim second place after Sunday's time trial, where he is favourite for the stage win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel did however virtually guarantee third place overall and the white jersey as best young rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic champion Richard Carapaz, regarded as the most combative rider on the 2024 Tour, will win the climb points jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carapaz came third on Saturday, won a stage and even took the yellow jersey for a day early in the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 3,498km on this 2024 Tour there remains just 34, a challenging run along the narrow, undulating corniche between the principality of Monaco, where many in the peloton live, and the French Riviera town of Nice. (AFP)

    Yemen's Houthi rebels say Israeli strikes hit Hodeida

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A senior Houthi official said the attack targeted fuel storage facilities and a power plant. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762490_1_20240721012921.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli warplanes struck the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Hodeida on Saturday, a day after a Houthi drone attack killed a civilian in Tel Aviv, the rebels said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, top Houthi official Mohammed Abdulsalam reported a "brutal Israel aggression against Yemen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attack targeted "fuel storage facilities and a power plant" in Hodeida "to pressure Yemen to stop supporting" Palestinians in the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Axios news outlet cited US and Israeli officials as saying that Israel carried out the strikes in retaliation for a Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi attack on Friday penetrated Israel's vaunted air defences and killed a civilian in a Tel Aviv apartment building, drawing Israeli threats of retaliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthi-run health ministry said there were deaths and injuries in the Hodeida strikes but it did not give a toll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement carried by the Houthi-run Al Masirah television, it said several people suffered "serious burns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage aired by Al Masirah, which has not been independently verified, showed a massive blaze on the seafront, with a large plume of black smoke rising into the sky.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A witness in Hodeida reported hearing several large explosions and seeing smoke over the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fuel pumps across the city closed following the attack, the correspondent said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hodeida has been hard hit by a series of strikes carried out by Britain and the United States since January in response to attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial shipping in the Red Sea
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Houthis have attacked at least 88 commercial vessels since November in a campaign they say targets Israeli-linked shipping in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. (AFP)

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762486_1_20240721001837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris claimed pole for the Hungarian Grand Prix on Saturday ahead of Oscar Piastri as McLaren celebrated their first front row lock-out in over a decade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's three-time world champion Max Verstappen took third in qualifying to start Sunday's race on the second row with the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz for company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's under pressure teammate Sergio Perez crashed out in the first session, triggering a red flag and increasing pressure on his job as the Dutch driver's number two at Red Bull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daniel Ricciardo, a former winner at the circuit, produced a late flash of speed once Q1 resumed to top the times in his RB from Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes with the seven-time champion's teammate George Russell the big name absentee from Q2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Norris led the pack into the top-10 shoot out, with Hamilton, who broke his lengthy winless run at Silverstone last time out, sneaking through with the slowest time of the middle leg of qualifying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuki Tsunoda ended up in a wall in his RB, forcing a second red flag with just two minutes left and Norris and Piastri provisionally locking out the front row for McLaren.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen had to sit out the conclusion of qualifying when it resumed after Tsunoda's stricken RB was removed due to an issue with his car as McLaren sealed the deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamilton is on the third row after the fifth fastest time ahead of Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari, Aston Martin duo Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll, with Ricciardo and Tsunoda completing the top 10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 at 10.40 pm, as the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remains rather loose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tropical depression is expected to strengthen slightly and adopt a more northwesterly track during the day. The Standby Signal No 1 will remain in force at least until 5 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is now centred within about 700 kilometres of Hong Kong and may still affect us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with it and the southwest monsoon are covering the central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast, the tropical cyclone will intensify and gradually take a more northwesterly track, moving in the general direction to the vicinity of Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under its influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later tomorrow. There will be swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.

    Bangladesh army on streets as police shoot protesters

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762476_1_20240720212531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soldiers were patrolling Bangladeshi cities on Saturday to quell growing civil unrest sparked by student demonstrations, with riot police firing on protesters who defied a government curfew.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This week's violence has killed at least 123 people so far, according to a count of victims reported by police and hospitals, and poses a monumental challenge to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's autocratic government after 15 years in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government curfew went into effect at midnight and the premier's office asked the military to deploy troops after police again failed to subdue widespread mayhem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The army has been deployed nationwide to control the law and order situation," said armed forces spokesman Shahdat Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The curfew will remain in effect until at least 10:00 am (0400 GMT) on Sunday, private broadcaster Channel 24 reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Streets in the capital Dhaka were almost deserted at daybreak, with troops on foot and in armoured personnel carriers patrolling the sprawling megacity of 20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But thousands returned to the streets later in the day in the residential neighbourhood of Rampura, with police firing at the crowd and wounding at least one person.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our backs are to the wall," protester Nazrul Islam, 52, said at the scene. "There's anarchy going on in the country... They are shooting at people like birds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hospitals have reported a growing number of gunshot deaths since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hundreds of thousands of people" had battled police across the capital on Friday, said police spokesman Faruk Hossain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At least 150 police officers were admitted to hospital. Another 150 were given first aid treatment," he said, adding that two officers had been beaten to death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protesters torched many police booths... Many government offices were torched and vandalised."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital said that another two police officers were killed on Saturday, while four people admitted to intensive care succumbed to their injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two more protesters were killed in the industrial town of Savar on Dhaka's outskirts, a major centre of Bangladesh's garment exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enam Medical College Hospital spokesman Zahidur Rahman confirmed the latter deaths, adding that "nine people came here with bullet wounds."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for Students Against Discrimination, the main group organising the protests, said that two of its leaders had been arrested since Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina had been due to leave the country on Sunday for a planned diplomatic tour but abandoned her plans after a week of escalating violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She has cancelled her Spain and Brazil tours due to the prevailing situation," said her press secretary Nayeemul Islam Khan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have called for an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits families loyal to Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the first deaths on Tuesday, protesters have begun demanding Hasina leave office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not about the rights of the students anymore," said business owner Hasibul Sheikh, 24, at the scene of the Rampura protest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are here as the general public now," he added. "Our demand is one point now, and that's the resignation of the government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pierre Prakash of Crisis Group said the lack of competitive elections since Hasina took office had led to mounting public frustration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With no real alternative at the ballot box, discontented Bangladeshis have few options besides street protests to make their voices heard," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The rising death toll is a shocking indictment of the absolute intolerance shown by the Bangladeshi authorities to protest and dissent," Babu Ram Pant of Amnesty International said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities imposed a nationwide internet shutdown on Thursday that remains in effect, severely hampering communication in and out of Bangladesh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government websites remain offline and major newspapers including the Dhaka Tribune and Daily Star have been unable to update their social media platforms since Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladesh Television, the state broadcaster, also remains offline after its Dhaka headquarters was set on fire by protesters the same day. (AFP)

    Former world snooker champion Reardon dies aged 91

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world champion Ray Reardon, the coal miner who dominated snooker in the 1970s, has died at the age of 91.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Welshman Reardon had previously been diagnosed with cancer and passed away on Friday night, his wife Carol confirmed on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91," a World Snooker Tour statement said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jimmy White, one of snooker's most popular players, said on X: "Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon won six world titles between 1970 and 1978, earning an MBE in the 1985 Queen's Birthday honours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nicknamed 'Dracula' after playing a session of the 1974 World Championship final in a cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket, Reardon rose to prominence as snooker became a popular sport in Britain thanks to the Pot Black television programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most," Reardon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He battled the flamboyant Alex Higgins in a long-running rivalry with the "Hurricane" that included an epic 18-15 defeat in the 1982 World Championship final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former world number one worked as a coal miner and was also a police officer for eight years before taking snooker by storm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was fortunate to survive a mining accident when a 12-foot girder and a deluge of rubble crashed down on him while he was building a pit lane, leaving him trapped for three hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right," he wrote in his autobiography.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reardon retired in 1991 at the age of 58 but remained in the snooker world, helping Ronnie O'Sullivan as a consultant during his run to the 2004 world title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Welsh Open trophy was named in Reardon's honour in 2016. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said young people from Hong Kong can play a key role in the nation's technological development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong said people in Hong Kong now had a better understanding of the country, as patriotic education had been integrated into their daily lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hoped the territory's young people can use their knowledge of technology to offer more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a relatively strong foundation in technology, and has many high-quality tech talents who love the country and Hong Kong," he said at an awards ceremony honouring the work of teenagers in aerospace innovation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an important driving factor in the country's development into an innovative nation... I hope Hong Kong teenagers can reach the peak of technology through their hard work and ambition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the country had high hopes that Hong Kong would develop into an international innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authorities will continue their efforts to nurture the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology is the primary productive force; talent is the primary opportunity; and innovation is the primary driving force," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government attaches great importance to the development of innovation and technology, making every effort to cultivate local talent and increase investment in the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that a Hong Kong resident had been selected for the national manned space programme, and he hopes more young people can aim to join developments in the national aerospace industry.

    Development chief welcomes approval of San Tin plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn has welcomed a decision by town planners to approve zoning plans for San Tin Technopole, a project that will see the creation of an information and technology hub in an area that now contains fish ponds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Linn said the administration was now looking at ways to speed up the development process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Town Planning Board gave its approval on Friday, saying the decision was made after considering the views of various stakeholder groups, government responses, as well as hours of internal discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the majority of its members agreed the technopole is strategically important for development of the SAR’s technology sector, given its proximity to the Shenzhen IT zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Linn said the administration may speed up the work by selling plots at the same time as carrying out land formation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why is it beneficial if we can sell the land while land formation is under way? The developers who buy the land can immediately start working on building plans. This eliminates the need for everyone to wait for each other," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the administration will apply for funding from the Legislative Council's Finance Committee, saying that if land formation work can commence by the end of this year, the first batch of formed land could be ready in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about what conservation work would be conducted, given that some 90 hectares of fish ponds will need to be reclaimed under the development plan, Linn said the impact is less significant than it seems, saying that more than half of the fish ponds affected are already abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development minister reiterated that the administration will stick to its promise and build a 338-hectare wetland conservation park alongside the technology hub as compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Science Park also welcomed the Town Planning Board's decision, saying the technology hub will provide additional space for research and collaboration between Hong Kong and the rest of Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media reports say 12 people have been confirmed dead after a highway bridge partially collapsed amid downpours on Friday night in northwestern Shaanxi province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency says sudden heavy rain and flash floods caused the collapse in the city of Shangluo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said five vehicles that had plunged into the river below had been recovered as of Saturday morning. Rescue operations were continuing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua said at least 31 people remained missing. It reported that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Friday, officials in another city in Shaanxi, Baoji, said five people had been confirmed dead and eight others were missing following torrential rain earlier in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the city had suffered record daily rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the government is closely monitoring ongoing problems caused by Friday's global technology outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech outage disrupted operations around the world on Friday, including halting flights and causing difficulties for the banking, health and media sectors in many countries. The problems have been blamed on a faulty software update issued by the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the SAR government's own computers were not affected, but officials were concerned and had been in touch with Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Chan said his deputy, Warner Cheuk, is monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government's computer system is not affected. The problem only affected particular airlines... But we're paying close attention to the incident, and we hope it returns to normal as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a problem affecting the whole world and it's an internal issue of the company. Hong Kong is not the only place affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said operations at the Hong Kong airport had fully returned to normal on Saturday, with airlines' travellers registration systems restored. That followed the implementation of contingency procedures on Friday, including manual check-ins in some cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some flights scheduled for Saturday remained cancelled, including 20 from the Hong Kong Express.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some travellers arrived early at the airport on Saturday, with one getting there four hours ahead of her flight to Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were afraid there would be a lot of people at the airport... but it's not the airline's problem, so I won't blame them," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist said his flight, scheduled for Friday night, was delayed for more than 17 hours, and he was furious about the arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only found out my flight was delayed after I waited at the airport for two hours. There's no compensation. They only allowed me to cancel the ticket. I'm very unsatisfied. I won't choose this airline anymore," he said.

    No rush to replace departed overseas judges: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Saturday said the Judiciary is in no rush to replace overseas judges who are departing the SAR's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two British jurists said last month that they were stepping down as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, while a Canadian member has said she will not extend her term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked on a radio programme how the judges would be replaced, Lam said there were "no vacancies" right now and they would seek new members at an appropriate time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't rely on non-permanent or overseas judges to handle our daily work. This is not our aim... but we hope to keep this system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If some venerable overseas judges take part in our cases, it will have positive effects on the development of our common law system, helping us become internationalised and maintain high standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US congressional committee and commission earlier wrote to the Washington government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR government officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there's nothing new with the calls for sanctions, describing the attacks as vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are criticising ongoing judicial proceedings. They intend to interfere in our judicial proceedings or put pressure on our judges... We are most alert about this, and I feel disgusted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the duties of Hong Kong courts would not be affected by calls for sanctions on judges.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday that it would issue the Standby Signal No 1 at 10.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remained rather loose, though squally showers were covering central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm is expect to take a northwesterly track towards Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said that under the storm's influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days. Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shores and refrain from engaging in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Macau's forecaster issued Tropical Cyclone Signal No 1 on Saturday morning, saying it was expected to remain in force for the whole day. The meteorological bureau said it would consider issuing Signal No 3 during the day on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters say another tropical cyclone over the western North Pacific will move towards the seas near Taiwan in the next few days.

    "Govt not obliged to help displaced flat owners"
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said the government isn’t obliged to provide extra help to flat owners who are forced to sell their homes under legal changes that will make it easier to redevelop old buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under changes approved by the Legislative Council on Thursday, the proportion of owners who have to agree to a redevelopment plan will fall to as little as 65 percent for properties at least 70 years old, instead of the previous 80 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said such deals were a matter for developers and flat owners, not the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The compulsory sales regime is to facilitate the redevelopment of our aged buildings in the private market," she told reporters after attending a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it is activities between the private owners of individual flats and those developers who are interested in acquiring their flats. So there is no question of the government going into this market and having flats built to rehouse those owners affected.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the government will assist minority owners in several ways, including establishing dedicated support centres that offer legal and valuation advice, as well as asking the Urban Renewal Authority to gather owners who would like their flats redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the development minister said that developers could be given the responsibility for land formation if they win tenders for sites in the huge Northern Metropolis development. She said the winning consortiums would also need to help build infrastructure and community facilities in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This approach will help reduce the cash flow burden on the government because we do not have to use public funding to do the site formation and other infrastructure on our own,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the fact that the government recorded revenue of less than HK$200 million from land sales in the first quarter, against a target for the full year of HK$33 billion. She said the situation may change as the year progresses, so there was no need yet to rethink the target.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The International Court of Justice, known as the World Court, in The Hague. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762403_1_20240720091646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law," President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and "the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as "fundamentally wrong" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICJ opinion also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor "render aid or assistance" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the opinion "historic" and urged states to adhere to it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation," Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague. (Reuters)

    Lowry takes Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Irishman Shane Lowry heads into the weekend at Troon two shots ahead. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762385_1_20240720052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday, as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Only 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc, with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here," said Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Remarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That four-hole stretch to start off is what cost me," said the Northern Irishman. "Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Woods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express announced on Saturday that it was cancelling 20 flights as it continues to grapple with the effects of Friday's massive global technical outage, though four flights previously announced as cancelled have been reinstated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The low-cost carrier said its booking and online check-in systems had "largely resumed" after
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HK Express confirms that the service system of our service provider Navitaire, which was previously impacted by the global Microsoft system outage, is gradually resumed," the airline said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing our best to ensure that all systems resume normal operation as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four flights that were reinstated, flights 172, 173, 552 and 553, will be moved to different take-off slots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is urging passengers whose flights have been cancelled not to go to the airport, but to make sure their contact information on the "Manage My Booking" app is up to date and to check their email regularly for the latest flight arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding," the airline said. "For other unaffected flights, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said on Saturday that its operations had returned to normal. Contingency measures, including manual check-ins for some flights, had been in place on Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell decisively for a second straight session on Friday following a major IT outage that roiled many businesses at a time when analysts consider the market "overbought."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Airlines, banks, TV stations and financial institutions were among those thrown into turmoil due to a faulty update to an antivirus programme for Windows systems from American cybersecurity group CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outage added more uncertainty at a time when markets were already edgy over speculation that President Joe Biden will withdraw from the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 40,287.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.7 percent to 5,505, while the Nasdaq declined 0.8 percent to 17,726.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The market was extremely overbought so it was just a matter of time before we had a pullback," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far it has been relatively mild and I think earnings are going to be an important factor as to whether" the market keeps falling, Cahill said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Netflix fell 1.5 percent despite adding eight million new subscribers in the second quarter. But some analysts said the company's third-quarter revenue forecast was disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other companies reporting results, Travelers sank 7.7 percent, while American Express fell 2.7 percent and Schlumberger advanced 2.0 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company at the heart of the global outage, tumbled 11.1 percent. CEO George Kurtz announced that a fix had been rolled out for the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starbucks jumped 6.9 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had taken a stake in the coffee company. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Teenage gymnast Shoko Miyata has been pulled from Japan's team for the Paris Olympics after being caught smoking and drinking, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 19-year-old, a world bronze medallist and captain of Japan's women's gymnastics team for the Games, was sent home from their training camp in Monaco after admitting she had violated their code of conduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With her confirmation and after discussions on all sides, it has been decided that she will withdraw from the Olympics," Japan Gymnastics Association (JGA) secretary general Kenji Nishimura told reporters in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said the association had been told that Miyata was seen smoking in a private setting in Tokyo some time at the end of June or beginning of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also reportedly drank alcohol in a room at Japan's national training centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smoking and drinking are both illegal under the age of 20 in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nishimura said it was not clear whether Miyata was at a party or drinking alone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Being a member of the Japan national gymnastics team is a position where you have high demands on you all the time," said JGA chairman Tadashi Fujita.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujita said that Miyata was already back in Japan after leaving the team's camp and that the JGA would give her support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Miyata won bronze in the balance beam at the 2022 world championships in Liverpool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the all-around title at Japan's national championships earlier this year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday he would meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi next week at an Asean ministerial meeting in Laos.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I speak to him on a fairly regular basis, and I'll be seeing him next week, in fact, in Laos," Blinken said during a security forum in the US state of Colorado, welcoming the dialogue with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify whether the two would hold a separate bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) foreign ministers meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite disagreements in several key areas, relations between the United States and China have stabilised since a summit between US President Joe Biden and his President Xi Jinping in November 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reestablished regular, high-level engagements between our countries, which is vitally important, because if you want to avoid any kind of unintended conflict, you have to start talking, you have to start communicating," said Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his second visit to China in less than a year, Blinken met in April with Xi, who called on the two countries to be "partners, not rivals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the top US diplomat spoke of a "steady pace" of meetings, including between the two countries' militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important because we're able to communicate very clearly where we disagree. So China at least knows where we're coming from, just like we know where they're coming from," he said. (AFP)

    Pogacar closes on Tour triumph with stage 19 win

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tadej Pogacar overcame previous issues with altitude to claim stage 19. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762375_1_20240720013404.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tadej Pogacar climbed to a convincing victory on stage 19 of the Tour de France on Friday, extending his overall lead over defending champion Jonas Vingegaard to close on a historic Tour-Giro double.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With two tough stages remaining, the 2020 and 2021 Tour de France champion Pogacar leads Vingegaard by 5min 3sec while Remco Evenepoel remains third, now at 7min 1sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar is also two stages away from a Giro d'Italia and Tour de France double, which would be a first since 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A dominant and confident Pogacar promised to attack here on the 'Queen' stage with its massive mountains and came into stage 19 with a 3min 11sec lead over Vingegaard, with Evenepoel at 5min 11sec in third.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous weak moments for the Team UAE rider have come at altitude and in hot weather, as he let slip the last two Tour de France titles to the Dane Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So the 25-year-old will have been happy riding under overcast skies as the mercury dipped to 18.5 Celsius.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was plenty of altitude on the menu however as the pack first crossed the fan-packed Col de la Bonette, a 23km climb at 7 percent average gradient to the dizzying altitude of 2,800m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final climb to Isola 2000 ski resort is hardly less crushing and Pogacar attacked with a jaw-dropping 10km to go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He left his rivals trailing in his wake and chewed up the attackers one by one in quick succession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matteo Jorgenson was second on the day at 21sec, while Simon Yates had led much of the way but dropped to third at 40sec after Pogacar passed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Richard Carapaz was fourth at 1min 11sec and Evenepoel fifth with Vingegaard on his wheel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eritrean break-out star Biniam Girmay retained the green sprint jersey ahead of Jasper Philipsen as the escape group took the intermediate sprint points way ahead of the peloton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Girmay and Philipsen have both won three stages on this year's race, while Pogacar has four. (AFP)

    Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong dies aged 80
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1762370-20240720.htm
   </link>
   <description>
    <![CDATA[<img alt="In power since 2011, Trong had enjoyed remarkable longevity in office. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762370_1_20240719235331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vietnamese leader Nguyen Phu Trong died on Friday aged 80 "after a period of illness," the ruling Communist Party said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came a day after the party that Trong led said he would hand over power to focus on receiving medical treatment for an undisclosed medical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, state media announced Trong had passed away in the afternoon at a military hospital "due to old age and serious illness."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be a special statement on the organisation of the funeral at the national level," state media added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's responsibilities have been handed to the country's largely ceremonial president, To Lam, a powerful former public security minister long seen as jockeying for the top job.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Politburo calls on the entire party, people and army to have absolute trust in the party's leadership and state management," it said on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's communist regime, which is in the midst of a complete overhaul, has undergone a series of upheavals in recent months, with ministers, business leaders and two presidents all falling from grace as part of a vast anti-corruption campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was voted in as president in May by Vietnam's rubber-stamp parliament after his predecessor was forced to resign as part of the anti-graft drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said at the time that Lam, who was deputy head of the steering committee on anti-corruption matters, had weaponised investigations to take down his political rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Headed by the party general secretary, Vietnam's leadership structure gives the president the second-most authority, and also includes the prime minister and the head of the National Assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trong's poor health had fuelled widespread speculation that he would not be able to stay in power until the 2026 party congress, which is expected to appoint a successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In power since 2011, Trong enjoyed remarkable longevity in office, during a mandate that rights groups say has coincided with increasing authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Known for being a technocrat and on good terms with Beijing, he structured the party around himself, benefiting from a decade of economic growth that strengthened his legitimacy. (AFP)

    Russia jails US reporter Gershkovich for 16 years

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Evan Gershkovich has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the US government and his employer believe are fabricated. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762368_1_20240719233856.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US reporter Evan Gershkovich was sentenced by a Russian court on Friday to 16 years prison for "espionage", a verdict reached after just over three weeks of secretive court proceedings denounced by Washington as a sham.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Russia has a policy of not exchanging prisoners internationally unless they have already been convicted, potentially paving the way for the 32-year-old to be swapped in a deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sentenced to "punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 16 years in a strict regime colony," Judge Andrei Mineyev said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gershkovich did not appear to react to the sentencing, standing in a glass defendants' cage in dark trousers and a T-shirt. He waved to his journalist colleagues as he was led away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wall Street Journal correspondent, who pleaded not guilty, became the first journalist in Russia to be charged with spying since the Cold War when he was detained in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has spent almost 16 months in detention on charges the United States government and his employer believe are fabricated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This disgraceful, sham conviction comes after Evan has spent 478 days in prison, wrongfully detained, away from his family and friends, prevented from reporting, all for doing his job as a journalist," the Journal's publisher Almar Latour and editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Press rights group Reporters Without Borders slammed the sentencing as "outrageous" and called for Gershkovich to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington believes he is being held as a bargaining chip to secure the release of Russians convicted abroad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His trial has moved rapidly since the first hearing in late June, with the prosecution and defence teams giving their final arguments on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other similar cases in Russia have dragged on far more slowly, with several weeks or even months between hearings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked on Friday, the Kremlin refused to be drawn into speculation about the prospect of a prisoner swap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin has provided no public evidence for the spying allegations against Gershkovich, saying only that he was caught "red-handed" spying on a tank factory in the Urals region and was working for the CIA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecutor said on Friday that Gershkovich acted with "careful measures of secrecy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tensions are running extremely high between the countries over Moscow's military offensive in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow and Washington have both said they are open to exchanging the reporter in a deal, but neither has given clues on when that might happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moscow's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that talks between US and Russian special services over possible prisoner exchanges were ongoing, without naming any specific individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has implied he wants to see the release of Vadim Krasikov, a Russian convicted in Germany of killing a Chechen separatist commander. German judges said it was an assassination orchestrated by Russian authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among other US nationals detained in Russia are reporter Alsu Kurmasheva and ballerina Ksenia Karelina, who are both dual US-Russian citizens, and former US marine Paul Whelan, who is serving a 16-year sentence for spying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US-born son of Soviet emigres raised in New Jersey, Gershkovich had reported from Russia since 2017, still returning for reporting trips following Russia's Ukraine offensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Moscow's isolated Lefortovo prison, he communicated with friends and family in hand-written letters that revealed he had not lost hope about his situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At his first trial hearing on June 26, he spoke briefly to greet journalists and appeared smiling and cheerful, while revealing that his head had been fully shaved, as it was on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A United Nations working group this month stated that Gershkovich's detention on spying charges was "arbitrary" and called for his immediate release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Evan has never been employed by the United States government. Evan is not a spy," US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House has warned US citizens still in Russia to "depart immediately" due to the risk of wrongful arrest. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it is highly concerned about a large-scale IT outage involving Microsoft systems, saying officials will keep a close watch on developments and prepare to react accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the Deputy Chief Secretary will be responsible for monitoring the situation, adding that the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has been in touch with Microsoft, urging it to assist affected companies, and come up with remedial measures as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said government systems are running normally for the time being, and that the Airport Authority has triggered an emergency response mechanism to minimise disruptions to passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Productivity Council’s Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT), meanwhile, called on people to back up their important data to prevent information loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It advised organisations to enable offline access for applications and documents as well to minimise interruptions to everyday operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The response team also reminded firms to come up with contingency plans in case similar incidents happen again.

    HK airport hit by global IT outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) on Friday said contingency measures are in place after a number of airlines were affected by a global outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the disruption affected five airlines, including Hong Kong Express, adding that these carriers had to switch to manual check-in, which was more time consuming and resulted in the delay of around a dozen flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dicky, a tourist from Thailand, said he had arrived at the airport hours before his flight but couldn't check into his HK Express flight to Bangkok
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I am not in a hurry today, so I still can wait, but I am not sure for some people... If someone is in a hurry, then there definitely will be a delay. I mean, if I cannot check in now, it means maybe the flight will be delayed because they just say, please wait a moment, and then when the time has come, they will call us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller, surnamed Li, said his flight to the Thai capital was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our travel plans will be slightly affected, for example the hotel arrangements, transportation and other issues. They might affect our itinerary. My kid may fall asleep very late tonight after arriving there. In such situations, we can only wait. There are no alternatives apart from waiting. I hope that the system will recover soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA said it has deployed additional staff to assist affected passengers, and that it is in close communication with airline operators to address the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said its computer system has been functioning normally despite the global outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it will ensure that the operations of public hospitals will continue as normal, and that it will closely monitor the situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A global tech outage was disrupting operations in multiple industries on Friday, with airlines halting flights, some broadcasters off-air and everything from banking to healthcare hit by system problems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines and Allegiant Air grounded flights citing communication problems. The order came shortly after Microsoft said it resolved its cloud services outage that impacted several low-cost carriers, though it was not immediately clear whether those were related.

  <br/>
  "A third party software outage is impacting computer systems worldwide, including at United. While we work to restore those systems, we are holding all aircraft at their departure airports," United said in a statement. "Flights already airborne are continuing to their destinations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's government said outages suffered by media, banks and telecoms companies there appeared to be linked to an issue at global cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to an alert sent by Crowdstrike to its clients, the company’s “Falcon Sensor” software is causing Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the “Blue Screen of Death”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alert, which was sent at 05.30GMT on Friday, also shared a manual workaround to rectify the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Crowdstrike spokesperson did not respond to emails or calls requesting comment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was no information to suggest the outage was a cyber security incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The outages rippled far and wide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The travel industry was among the hardest hit with airports around the world, including Tokyo, Amsterdam, Berlin and several Spanish airports reporting problems with their systems and delays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  International airlines, including Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned of problems with their booking systems and other disruptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Britain, booking systems used by doctors were offline, multiple reports from medical officials on X said, while Sky News, one of the country's major news broadcasters was off air, apologising for being unable to transmit live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banks and other financial institutions from Australia to India and South Africa warned clients about disruptions to their services, while LSEG Group reported an outage of its data and news platform Workspace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amazon's AWS cloud service provider said in a statement that it was "investigating reports of connectivity issues to Windows EC2 instances and Workspaces within AWS."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear whether all reported outages were linked to Crowdstrike problems or there were other issues at play. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has partnered with its third tech company, Galbot, to further develop the city's AI sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company makes a humanoid robot, also named Galbot, which can complete basic household chores, such as hanging clothes, opening and closing drawers and pouring drinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Wang, director of the PKU-Galbot Lab of Embodied AI, explained what the partnership with HKIC means for the development of AI in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Leveraging Hong Kong’s strong market resources, abundant talent pool, and broad international insights, we look forward to curating attention and building credibility in domestic and international markets. Concurrently, we will bring Hong Kong the most cutting-edge embodied AI technology and cultivate top-tier talent with multi-disciplinary capabilities,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership is also aimed at opening up more avenues for discussion surrounding AI for the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 secondary school students were invited to a launch ceremony on Friday, to engage in dialogue with forum guests and interact with Galbot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to doing more with Galbot in terms of cultivating our young talent,” said Clara Chan, CEO of HKIC.

    'Whale likely died of propeller-induced injuries'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A baleen whale found dead off Sai Kung last year was killed by back and spine injuries that were likely caused by propellers of a “fast-moving vessel”, authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said they could not determine what type of vessel had hit the mammal, but ruled out the possibility it was a whale-watching or fishing boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sightings of the juvenile Bryde’s whale had led to people going out in boats to try to get a glimpse of it, and officials urged against any chases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An expert from Spain consulted on the matter narrowed down the time of the whale's death to between the evening of July 30 and the early hours of the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A necropsy also found two fresher wounds on the whale, including one near its blowhole and the other near the dorsal fin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can be concluded that the cause of death of this Bryde’s whale was a fatal boat strike,” the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The individual may have become separated from its mother or lost her, depriving it of maternal care and guidance. As a result, it was exposed to an unfavourable environment and local dangers.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Leung, who chairs an expert group on the conservation of marine mammals, said the boat involved was likely a dual propeller vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said no whale-watching activity was detected during the four days prior to the mammal’s death, and that fishing vessels generally do not travel at such high speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We cannot tell what kind of vessel it was, and also we cannot tell the size of the vessel,” said AFCD director Mickey Lai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the only thing we know…the vessel striking the whale should be travelling at a very high speed. We are talking about over 10 knots or even faster. But for the exact speed, we can’t tell.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten knots is roughly equivalent to 18.5 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said officials will look into amending laws to designate temporary restriction areas more quickly, and banning whale-watching activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the legislation can give us more power in imposing more control within the restriction area, and give us more flexibility, and also give us more power to designate this area in a shorter period of time, it can really help us to protect the whale within a really short period of time,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are talking about emergency situations, and everything has to be done within a very short period of time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration aims to put forward concrete proposals to the expert group in the third quarter of this year the earliest.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority (HA) on Friday announced new rules that punish public housing tenants for feeding feral pigeons or hanging objects from their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HA, tenants will receive seven penalty points for "feeding feral pigeons or other wild animals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tenants will also be slapped with seven penalty points for "hanging or placing objects with potential risk of falling from height outside the window, balcony or façade".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, residents are restricted from placing objects in corridors or staircases only.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, tenants will receive 15 penalty points if they resist or obstruct the HA or its authorised personnel in carrying out their duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any household that accumulates 16 points within a two-year period faces eviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enhanced measures aim to provide a clean, hygienic and safe living environment for public rental housing (PRH) residents and strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement," an HA spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the HA will step up promotion before the new regulations come into force.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Cruise & Yacht Industry Association announced on Friday that it has relocated to Singapore, saying it's following the lead of international cruise ships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association said it made the move this month after taking into account operating costs and that a lot of international operators have switched their focus to the city state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's chief executive, Kara Yeung, said other cities did more than Hong Kong to support the sector's recovery after the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong was relatively lacking behind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a few cruises came to the region this summer, and none of them call the SAR as their home port."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Hong Kong has been promoting the recovery of the cruise industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said cruise ship arrivals this year have returned to pre-Covid levels, and it is working hard to increase the number of ship calls.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New People's Party on Friday called for a reduction in rents for retailers operating from government premises, to help them cope with a citywide slump in sales.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said it recently sent questionnaires to more than 400 stores across the city, with shopkeepers reporting a drop in customer numbers and an increase in store vacancies, particularly in Northern District and Tai Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five percent of the shops said their rent had gone up after the pandemic, while almost 60 percent said they had seen a fall in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent official figures showed retail spending in May was down 11 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party noted that many people are heading to Shenzhen at the weekend to make cheaper purchases, urging the government to help alleviate the pressure on local retailers with rent cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also suggested the government should come up with area-specific promotions to help all 18 districts in the city attract visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't believe that [Hong Kong] has lost the market competition. We can have different promotion techniques for the government to promote together with the districts other than doing the same thing in all 18 districts," said the party's vice-chairwoman Eunice Yung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that rather than focusing on special days, tourism promotions should be expanded to ensure a constant stream of visitors.

    Trump takes centre stage in Republican convention

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump, centre, along with members of his family and his running mate, JD Vance, second right, greet party faithful on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762292_1_20240719154059.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump, sombre and bandaged, accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention in a speech that described in detail the assassination attempt that could have ended his life just five days earlier before laying out a sweeping populist agenda, particularly on immigration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old former US president, known best for his bombast and aggressive rhetoric, began his acceptance speech with a softer and deeply personal message that drew directly from his brush with death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moment by moment, the crowd listening in silence, Trump described standing onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his head turned to look at a chart on display when he felt something hit his ear. He raised his hand to his head and saw immediately that it was covered in blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin’s bullet would have perfectly hit its mark,” Trump said. “And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump’s address, the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes, marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing political opportunity in the wake of his near-death experience, the often bombastic Republican leader embraced a new tone he hopes will help generate even more momentum in an election that appears to be shifting in his favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart,” Trump said, wearing a large white bandage on his right ear, as he has all week, to cover a wound he sustained in the Saturday shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While he spoke in a gentler tone than at his usual rallies, Trump also outlined an agenda led by what he promises would be the largest deportation operation in US history. He repeatedly accused people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally of staging an “invasion.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, he teased new tariffs on trade and an “America first” foreign policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also falsely suggested Democrats had cheated during the 2020 election he lost, despite a raft of federal and state investigations proving there was no systemic fraud, and suggested “we must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement” even as he has long called for prosecutions of his opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not mention abortion rights, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the US Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump nominated three of the six justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump at his rallies often takes credit for Roe being overturned and argues states should have the right to institute their own abortion laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nor did he mention the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed for the riot as “hostages.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indeed, Trump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the “current administration.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was Donald Trump who destroyed our economy, ripped away rights, and failed middle class families,” said Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden campaign chair, in a statement after the speech. “Now he pursues the presidency with an even more extreme vision for where he wants to take this country.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention ends at an uncertain moment in the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With less than four months to go in the contest, major changes in the race are possible, if not likely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party’s presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long pressed by allies to campaign more vigorously, Biden is instead in isolation at his beach home in Delaware after having been diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention has showcased a Republican Party reshaped by Trump since he shocked the GOP establishment and won over the party’s grassroots on his way to the party’s 2016 nomination. Rivals Trump has vanquished – including senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis – put aside their past criticisms and gave him their unqualified support.

  <br/>
  The end of the Communist Party's third plenum on Thursday saw the adoption of a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively, with the goal of building a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Latest government figures showed growth in the world's second-largest economy slowed to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, down from 5.3 percent in the January-March period. Retail sales also reported slower growth, from 3.7 percent in May to 2 percent in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of domestic demand, they're trying to instil confidence. They want people to believe in what the party is doing, the fact that China is 30 percent of the world's growth, that it continues to be the centre of manufacturing," Einar Tanger, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese consumers should realise that, that China is in a better position to weather the current storms and uncertainties that are being caused internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tanger said another key challenge for the authorities is to stabilise the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate sector is a product of very large companies taking huge leverage. They were borrowing massive amounts of money on the expectation that they'd make lots of profits. Unfortunately, the demand did not justify supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government does not want to see a spiral of inflationary rises in housing prices because they're already too high. So what they're trying to do is to keep them steady. So you can expect them to continue to say, 'Look, if you've bought a house, we'll make sure that it gets finished,' but they're not going to put money into the pockets of these very wealthy developers who have not been very good businessmen."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday said it will boost local governments' fiscal capacity and expand their tax sources, a day after it laid out a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press conference to explain the guiding principles from the third plenary session which concluded on Thursday, Han Wenxiu, deputy director in charge of the party's financial and economic affairs said the central government will be increasing its fiscal spending obligations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that President Xi Jinping had pointed out that economic structural reform and livelihood improvement are at the forefront of accelerating reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To address the fiscal difficulties faced by the local governments and grassroots-level governments, we need to improve the fiscal relations between the central and local governments, increase the fiscal resources and expand tax bases of local governments," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Han said authorities would also study ways to tweak the taxation system so that it is better positioned to develop new forms of businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked how the nation would handle the slowdown in the real estate sector while supporting new economic growth drivers, Han explained that there are major changes in the property market's supply and demand and that it is undergoing a period of adjustment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the nation needs to uphold the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to promote stable and healthy development in the real estate market. Recently there have been some positive changes in the real estate market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to make progress in both absorbing the existing stock and improving new supplies, further implement and improve the new policies for real estate development, ensure the delivery of housing projects and activate the stock of residential properties and land resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Han also said China should speed up the issuance and use of special treasury bonds, and that monetary policy should be flexible, moderate, accurate and effective. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Public housing tenants to pay 10 percent more in rent

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public housing tenants will soon see rents increase by 10 percent, after a committee under the Housing Authority backed the move.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The higher rents will take effect in October, but the authority has agreed to a three-month exemption period for most tenants, meaning they will not have to pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairperson of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, on Friday said the waiver takes into account factors such as the impact on tenants and the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there is a waiver, the Housing Authority will have a huge burden in the coming years. We have a massive housing development plan and the economy is also not very good, so we need to be prudent in our financial management," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding this exemption, the authority has tried its best and gritted our teeth to offer this waiver. We hope that members of the public and tenants will understand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rent adjustment will see an average increase of HK$230. Wong said none of the committee members had an issue with the 10 percent increase, and that she believed it is an amount that residents can afford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent. Between 2012 and 2018, there was a 10 percent increase following every rental review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said the mechanism, which takes into account tenants' income, has been effective, and that now is not a suitable time to review the system given the current economic situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed suggestions that rents should be reviewed annually or that the rate of inflation should be taken into account.

 Several people were injured when a taxi hit a road barrier and flipped over on Kwai Chung Road on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver and his passenger were taken to hospital for treatment, as were two passengers on a passing KMB bus that was struck by debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online photos showed two windows on the lower deck of the route 290 bus were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately in Fanling, eight people were injured when a KMB bus, a van and a private car collided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KMB said it would cooperate with police investigations into both accidents.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762214_1_20240719062619.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly condemns and opposes US politicians' remarks criticising the SAR's homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after a congressional committee and commission both wrote to the US government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the letter made slandering remarks and despicable threats against relevant personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said the so-called sanctions mentioned in the letter were a "despicable political manipulation to intimidate officials", and amounted to gross interference in the affairs of Hong Kong and the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement said safeguarding national security was an inherent right of all sovereign states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the US had at least 21 pieces of legislation safeguarding national security and was in no position to point its finger at Hong Kong for doing the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended a recent national security trial against 47 people, saying the conviction of 45 of them over a conspiracy offence showed the scale and the seriousness of the criminal scheme.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rafael Nadal continued his Olympic preparations with a confident 6-4, 6-4 win over Cameron Norrie at the Bastad Open on Thursday, showing signs of the power hitting that fired him to 14 French Open titles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard continued his return to winning ways on the Swedish clay as he moved into the quarter-finals, racking up his ninth Tour win of the year and back-to-back wins for the first time since reaching the last-16 of the Madrid Open in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Great feelings now, I've been a while now without playing on the Tour since Roland Garros and had the chance to compete well against a great player like Cameron," said Nadal during his on-court interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I played, for moments, good tennis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nadal now leads the former world number eight Briton 5-1 in their head-to-head record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-time Grand Slam champion was unstoppable as he ground his opponent down with powerful, topspin-heavy ground strokes. He broke Norrie again and served out to love, having won five games in a row to take the match in straight sets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Belgian Victor Campenaerts wept with joy after winning stage 18 of the Tour de France as overall leader Tadej Pogacar and defending champion Jonas Vingegaard saved their thunder for a trilogy of harsh stages over the final weekend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pogacar and Vingegaard were relaxed as the escape pulled 15 minutes clear, the pair content to hold fire as the 2024 Tour reaches its climax in Nice on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tomorrow and Saturday," Pogacar said at the line, shaking his head as if the names of the day's themselves explained the massive challenge ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we enjoyed today with the team, what a wonderful journey," said the 2020 and 2021 champion who came second on the last two Tours to Vingegaard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old Slovenian is three days away from a cycling landmark as he won the Giro d'Italia in May and will become the first rider in 25-years to complete the double if he holds on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar retained a 3min 11sec lead on Vingegaard as the peloton rolled gently over the finish line 13min 41sec after the winner, while rookie Remco Evenepoel is third at 5min 09sec. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Marseille have signed striker Mason Greenwood from Manchester United, the Ligue 1 side announced on Thursday, despite the objection of some of the French club's fans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old, who has played once for England, was suspended in January 2022 by Manchester United following allegations of attempted rape and sexual assault but prosecutors dropped charges in February 2023. He spent last season on loan at Getafe in La Liga.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Olympique de Marseille are delighted to announce the signing of Mason Greenwood from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker has signed for the club following a successful medical," said the French club on their website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marseille made no mention of the allegations in their statement. They called Greenwood "a precocious talent" and an "English nugget".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The southern club, eighth in Ligue 1 last season, said their new striker will wear the number 10 shirt but did not specify the length of his contract or mention any fee to Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However the deal is reported to be worth an estimated 30 million euros (US$32.7 million).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We wish Mason all the best in his future career," said United on their website. (AFP)

    Trump to rally unified Republicans in grand finale

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Donald Trump arrived at the convention looking emotional and with a bandaged ear. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762205_1_20240719052225.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donald Trump will get a hero's welcome on Thursday as he accepts the Republican Party's nomination to run for US president in a speech capping a convention dominated by the recent attempt on his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 78-year-old will address the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin hoping to build momentum toward victory over President Joe Biden in the November election and a second term in the White House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supporters have been lining up all week to applaud the former president for his bravery since Saturday's assassination bid by a gunman at a Pennsylvania rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As some of his loyalists blamed Democrats' rhetoric for the attack, Trump said he had torn up a more aggressive version of his keynote address in favour of one to "unite our country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just grateful we're going to hear from him. It's a miracle that his life was spared, and I really believe it was God's hand," said Teena Horlacher, a 50-year-old convention delegate from Utah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd love for him to talk about Saturday, what his feelings were."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has a 90-minute speaking slot, from 9:00 to 10:30 pm (0100 to 0230 GMT on Friday), according to a source familiar with the schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also set to address the convention are the world-famous retired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, and longtime friend Dana White who is chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has attended multiple UFC bouts as he seeks to cultivate his image as an alpha-male stereotype and lock in younger male votes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule notably shows no speaking slot for former first lady Melania Trump, a clear break from tradition at modern-era US nominating conventions, where spouses have almost always taken the stage in bids to personalise the candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump has seen his poll lead expand since Biden's dismal debate performance last month threw his party into chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican campaign has even been talking up Trump's chances in Democratic strongholds like Minnesota and Virginia, potentially forcing Biden funds and manpower away from defending his "blue wall" in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's keynote address on Thursday will be followed on television and online by millions, closing the convention by promising what his team calls "a new golden age for America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It brings down the curtain on four days of speeches from elected officials, entertainers, industry figures and everyday Americans who mixed with some 50,000 Republicans attending the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering opened on Monday with a vote to confirm Trump as the party's nominee after he won almost every state's primary contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has been the first convention over which Trump has had total control, after a 2016 edition hampered by party divisions and a second appearance in 2020 reined in by the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The schedule was designed around his image, with themes for each day playing on his "Make America Great Again" rallying cry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump set the tone when he walked slowly into the Fiserv Forum arena on the opening day – looking emotional and with a bandaged ear, just two days after the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The week also saw Trump name right-wing Senator JD Vance as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old author of "Hillbilly Elegy," a best-selling memoir about growing up poor in working-class America, is a one-time critic who has become one of Trump's most staunch backers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump himself was a diminished figure after his 2020 election loss and a subsequent riot at the US Capitol by his supporters, but he has spent much of the last four years reshaping Republican politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Installing close allies, including his daughter-in-law Lara Trump on the Republican National Committee, the mercurial tycoon has effectively crushed dissent within the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump is increasingly confident of victory – despite multiple legal problems and two impeachments clouding his first term – as Biden is reeling from weak polls and concerns over his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 81, Biden has been facing growing calls from his own side to quit the race, and he suffered another blow on Wednesday when he was diagnosed with Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a clearly stark contrast between the strength of President Trump and the weakness of President Biden," said Mississippi delegate Clifton Carroll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And I think he'll expand on that, and really send a message that the entire United States of America can get behind whether they're Republican, Democrat or Independent." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday as most large tech shares continued a retreat while a closely watched risk index pushed higher.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech shares have been under pressure in recent days amid talk that the market is "overbought" after a torrid run so far in 2024 on bullishness over artificial intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "VIX" volatility index rose about 10 percent in a move that some market watchers tied to political pressure building on President Joe Biden to exit the 2024 campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones dropped 1.3 percent to 40,665, retreating after three straight records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent to 5,544, while the Nasdaq declined 0.7 percent to 17,871.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses were broad-based, with energy the only one of 11 industrial sectors to advance in the S&P 500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth, noted that Thursday's losses were broad-based and included smaller equities that had benefited in recent days from the tech selloff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't take much of an excuse for markets to take some profits when they've had such a good run," Hogan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding politics, Hogan said, "the market doesn't like uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said speculation about Biden "could create some short-term election anxiety" after more investors expected a win by Donald Trump following their June presidential debate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Central Bank meanwhile held borrowing costs steady, giving policymakers more time to assess progress on inflation after last month's first interest rate cut in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  United Airlines shed 1.2 percent after reporting higher profits in the second quarter but cautioning that it would trim back capacity later in 2024 due to excess flights in the US market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DR Horton jumped 10 percent after reporting higher profits and revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited, and demographics supporting housing demand continue to be favourable," said David Auld, executive chairman of the homebuilder. (AFP)

    Biden, Netanyahu due to meet next week: White House

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden is still expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits Washington next week but it will depend on his recovery from Covid, the White House said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We have every expectation that the two leaders will have a chance to see each other while prime minister Netanyahu is in town" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters in a briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu is set to address the US Congress on Wednesday and Israeli media had reported a meeting with Biden on Monday, but Kirby said "I can't tell you at this point what that exactly is going to look like."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to make sure that the president's health and his recovery from Covid takes priority and if and how that might expect a discussion with the prime minister."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's war in Gaza will be top of the agenda for the meeting, with Biden pressing for a peace deal with Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden was suffering from mild symptoms after testing positive with Covid on Wednesday, Kirby said, taking him off the campaign trail just as he fights mounting calls from Democrats to quit his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kirby said that neither the political turmoil nor his illness had affected his duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While he's certainly focused on getting better, as anyone who has Covid would want to do, he's being kept up to speed as appropriate by his leadership team and certainly that includes on the national security front," he said. (AFP)

    UK's Starmer pledges European reset at summit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Keir Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762195_1_20240718235359.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday vowed to rebuild trust with European allies damaged by Brexit as he hosted dozens of leaders at a summit where they reaffirmed backing for Ukraine and pledged to tackle irregular migration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Starmer, premier for two weeks, told more than 45 European leaders the UK would be a "friend and partner" as he started work to improve ties hit by the country's tortuous departure from the European Union under his Conservative predecessors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to work with all of you to reset relationships, rediscover our common interest and renew the bonds of trust and friendship that brighten the fabric of European Life," the 61-year-old Labour leader told them as he opened the European Political Community (EPC) meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe is grappling with challenges ranging from supporting Kyiv after Russia's full-scale assault to breaking up people-smuggling gangs contributing to record levels of irregular migration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the background hangs the increasing possibility of Donald Trump regaining the White House in November, with fears over his commitment to the Western military alliance Nato.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's newly elected running mate JD Vance is an outspoken critic of military aid to Ukraine and has pushed for negotiations with Russia to end the two-year-plus war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very important to be here, for Ukraine, especially this tough period, for us during the war," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us it's very important to maintain unity in Europe because always this unity leads to strong decisions," added Zelensky before discussions with Starmer and a meeting with head of state King Charles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While at the summit, the Ukrainian leader signed long-term security cooperation agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, attending an EPC summit for the first time, reaffirmed the alliance's support for Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a departure from the often fractious relations that characterised the run-up to Brexit, Starmer, who led Labour to a landslide election win over the Tories on July 4, told European counterparts that his government would be "a friend and a partner ready to work with you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called irregular migration a "crisis" affecting every country attending. More than 380,000 undocumented migrants crossed the EU's borders last year, and tens of thousands made their way to Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer called for a sharing of resources, intelligence and tactics to "shut down the smuggling routes and smash the gangs," behind migrant Channel crossings from northern France in small boats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a problem that dogged the Tory administrations under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cooperation was "the most efficient" way to tackle the problem, French President Emmanuel Macron said, the morning after one migrant died and 71 others were rescued off the French coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer has conversations pencilled in with several European leaders, including Macron, as he fleshes out what he wants the new relationship with the EU to look like.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former human rights lawyer and chief state prosecutor supported Britain remaining in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum and was once Labour's Brexit spokesman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has ruled out rejoining the European single market, customs union or freedom of movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he does want to negotiate a new security pact with the bloc and a veterinary agreement to ease border checks on agricultural foods, as well as an improved trading deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starmer was quick out of the blocks to congratulate Ursula von der Leyen on securing another term as European Commission president. He eagerly anticipated "working closely" with the EU chief, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish Premier Simon Harris described Labour's reset with Europe as a "gamechanger" while European Council chief Charles Michel said he hoped that a "new chapter" would be opened with the UK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One high-ranking EU official said there were "good vibes" in the early contacts with the new Labour government, but warned that the EU was not looking to "reopen" the Brexit deal with Britain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blenheim Palace is the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill. The Treaty of London, which signed into existence the Council of Europe in 1949, was on display, adding further symbolism to the proceedings. (AFP)

    Vieira quits as Strasbourg coach, linked to USA job

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Vieira stood down as manager of Strasbourg, the Ligue 1 club confirmed on Thursday, as his name was linked to the vacant United States men's team coaching job.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vieira, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, joined Strasbourg last season and is leaving "by mutual agreement," the French club said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, 48, coached New York City in the MLS between 2016-2018 and, according to widespread reports, could be returning to the US to succeed Gregg Berhalter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Berhalter was axed as United States coach following their first-round exit in the Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira was asked about the States job last week after Strasbourg lost 4-0 to Turkish giants Fernebahce in a pre-season friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States? Ah no, my focus is 100% in Alsace (Strasbourg)" he told a local newspaper in the north eastern region of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vieira, who was under contract with Strasbourg until 2026, ended last season with his club in 13th place in Ligue 1. (AFP)

    32 dead in Bangladesh unrest as state TV set ablaze

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bangladeshi students set fire to the country's state broadcaster on Thursday, a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina appeared on the network seeking to calm escalating clashes that have killed at least 32 people.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of protesters demanding reform of civil service hiring rules fought back and overwhelmed riot police who had fired at them with rubber bullets, chasing the retreating officers to BTV's headquarters in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incensed crowd then set ablaze the network's reception building and dozens of vehicles parked outside, a BTV official said on condition of anonymity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broadcaster said "many people" were trapped inside as the fire spread but another official from the station later said that they had safely evacuated the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's government has ordered schools and universities to close indefinitely as police step up efforts to bring the country's deteriorating law and order situation under control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier appeared on the broadcaster on Wednesday night to condemn the "murder" of protesters and vow that those responsible will be punished regardless of their political affiliation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But violence worsened on the streets despite her appeal for calm as police again attempted to break up demonstrations with rubber bullets and tear gas volleys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 25 people were killed on Thursday in addition to seven killed earlier in the week, according to a tally of casualty figures from hospitals, with hundreds more wounded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police weaponry was the cause of at least two-thirds of those deaths, based on descriptions given by hospital figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've got seven dead here," said an official at Uttara Crescent Hospital in the capital Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first two were students with rubber bullet injuries. The other five had gunshot injuries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 1,000 others had been treated at the hospital for injuries sustained during clashes with police, the offical said, adding many had rubber bullet wounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Didar Malekin of the online news outlet Dhaka Times said that Mehedi Hasan, one of his reporters, had been killed while covering clashes in Dhaka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several cities across Bangladesh saw violence throughout the day as riot police marched on protesters who had begun another round of human blockades on roads and highways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Helicopters rescued 60 police officers who were trapped on the roof of a campus building at Canadian University, the scene of some of Dhaka's fiercest clashes on Thursday, the elite Rapid Action Battalion police force said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Near-daily marches this month have demanded an end to a quota system that reserves more than half of civil service posts for specific groups, including children of veterans from the country's 1971 liberation war against Pakistan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Critics say the scheme benefits children of pro-government groups that back Hasina, 76, who has ruled the country since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her administration is accused by rights groups of capturing state institutions and stamping out dissent, including by the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mubashar Hasan, a Bangladesh expert at the University of Oslo in Norway, said the protests had grown into a wider expression of discontent with Hasina's autocratic rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are protesting against the repressive nature of the state," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Protesters are questioning Hasina's leadership, accusing her of clinging onto power by force," he added. "The students are in fact calling her a dictator."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bangladeshis reported widespread mobile internet outages around the country on Thursday, two days after internet providers cut off access to Facebook – the protest campaign's key organising platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Junior telecommunications minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said that the government had ordered the network cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earlier told reporters that social media had been "weaponised as a tool to spread rumours, lies and disinformation," forcing the government to restrict access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along with police crackdowns, demonstrators and students allied to the premier's ruling Awami League have also battled each other on the streets with bricks and bamboo rods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hasina's national address did not assign responsibility for the deaths, but descriptions from hospital authorities and students suggest at least some died when police used supposedly non-lethal weapons on demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rights group Amnesty International said video evidence from clashes this week showed that Bangladeshi security forces had used unlawful force. (AFP)

    Justin Thomas shows promise in 1st round of Open

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Justin Thomas made a strong start at the 152nd Open but then hit trouble as rain squalls kept a grip on the early scoring at Royal Troon in Scotland on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sweden's Alex Noren was the early clubhouse leader with a birdie on the 18th giving him a two-under-par 69, but Thomas initially looked like eclipsing that mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former PGA Championship winner gathered four birdies with one bogey on his outward nine and then birdied the 10th to top the early leader board on four under.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey on the 13th dropped him back into the pack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow American Bryson DeChambeau, last month's US Open champion, started in the company of young Swede Ludvig Aberg, who is ranked fourth in the world, but the big-hitting DeChambeau suffered a terrible start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was five over after his first six holes and in danger of playing himself out of contention on day one. (Reuters)

 Customs officers on Thursday said they seized 31 kilos of suspected methamphetamine and five kilos of suspected cocaine in seven drug trafficking cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul had a market value of about HK$20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said for six of the cases, drug traffickers were trying to hide the suspected narcotics in co-working spaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said drug traffickers would ship packages declared as chairs and children's toys from the United States and send them to different shared office spaces in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, aged 38, suspected of receiving the shipment was arrested in Wong Chuk Hang on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, officers arrested a 23-year-old passenger from Kuala Lumpur at the airport on Wednesday. He was found carrying suspected methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two arrested men have both been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug.

<div class="itemFullText">
 European lawmakers on Thursday re-elected Ursula von der Leyen to a second five-year term as president of the European Commission during their first parliamentary session since the June elections.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Von der Leyen won with the support of 401 MEPs in the 720-seat chamber -- comfortably over the 361-vote majority she needed to remain head of the EU's executive body. There were 284 who voted against in the secret ballot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was among the first world leaders to congratulate von der Leyen for securing another five-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said her re-election was "a clear sign of our ability to act in the European Union, especially in difficult times," Scholz wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among her biggest pledges was a plan to launch EU defence projects starting with a European air shield, a commitment not to weaken Europe's climate change policies, and more help for European industries struggling to compete with the US and China while they invest in curbing emissions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next European Commission would propose a new competitiveness fund in the next EU budget to invest in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also outlined changes on migration policy, including a new approach for the return of migrants, and plans to triple the number of European border and coast guards. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and other top leaders attend a meeting at the end of the third plenary session, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 High-quality development is China's priority in building a modern socialist country, and the nation must consciously place reform in a more prominent position, according to a communique issued on Thursday after a top-level meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China’s Communist Party wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique stated the need to deepen supply-side structural reform, improve incentive and constraint mechanisms for promoting high-quality development, and create new growth drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will improve the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy, for developing the service sector, for modernising infrastructure, and for enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains," the communique stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to evaluate the implementation of the '14th Five-Year Plan' and work on the preliminary planning work of the '15th Five-Year Plan'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be measures to prevent and defuse risks in key areas such as real estate, local government debt, and small and medium-sized financial institutions, according to the communique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, while encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public economy, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum document also listed the overall objectives of further deepening reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernised our system and capacity for governance, and basically realised socialist modernisation," the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will pave the way for building China into a great modern socialist country by the middle of the century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique added the reform tasks laid out in the resolution should be completed in 2029 when the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will resolutely safeguard national security and social stability, vigorously promote national defence and its military, continue to promote works focusing on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and push for diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the country's opening up, the document said the party will steadily expand institutional opening up, deepen the structural reform on foreign trade, further reform the management systems of investment, improve regional opening up, and refine the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, the communique said the session decided to accept former foreign minister Qin Gang's resignation from the Central Committee, and confirmed the Politburo’s earlier decision to expel former defence minister Li Shangfu as well as Li Yuchao and Sun Jinming of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, from the party.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's representatives to the country's political bodies submitted their suggestions for the Policy Address to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday, focusing on patriotic education and economic development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the submission, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), Starry Lee, said it is the right time to put forward patriotic education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the right time to do so. First of all, our country [has] our own policy and legislation to govern that. Hong Kong, as part of the country, [we are obligated] to do that. We understand...it will further make 'One Country, Two Systems' a more effective system for our own country," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dennis Lam, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), urged the government to use Hong Kong's private healthcare services to attract mainlanders to the city, as more Hongkongers are seeking medical care on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bank of East Asia's Co-CEO Brian Li, who is a local delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the government should bolster the SAR's status as an offshore renminbi hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can strengthen our role as an offshore renminbi centre by gradually expanding the pool of offshore RMB funds and the scope of their applicability. We can also promote trading and fundraising in the stock market and the over-the-counter market, enhancing the international role of the RMB,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third Policy Address in October.

<div class="itemFullText">
 TSMC on Thursday said it expects third-quarter revenue to surge by as much as 34 percent from a year earlier after the world's largest contract chipmaker posted a quarterly net profit that beat market expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier for US tech giants Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards the adoption of AI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC's April-June net profit climbed to T$247.8 billion (US$7.60 billion) from T$181.8 billion a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The profit beat a T$238.8 billion forecast for the quarter which ended June 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said second-quarter revenue rose 33 percent year-on-year to US$20.8 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of between US$19.6 billion and US$20.4 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue for the current quarter is expected to be at least US$22.4 billion compared with US$17.3 billion in the same period last year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said it called the police over an incident that led to disruption to Light Rail services in Yuen Long, saying it suspected a truck had hit and damaged overhead cables.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 47-year-old truck driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was held for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said no injury was reported from the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail company said the incident happened at around 2pm, and the affected section was near the Shui Pin Wai Stop, next to Yuen Long Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said services gradually returned to normal after around three hours, following emergency repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Light Rail routes, including 610, 614, 615, 671P and 751, had to be diverted. Free shuttle buses  were laid on for passengers.
