<div class="itemFullText">
 China's legendary table tennis player Ma Long and artistic swimmer Feng Yu will carry China's flag at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma, who has claimed three team golds and two singles titles in previous Olympic Games, will be making his fourth Olympic appearance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having led China's artistic swimming team to a silver medal at Tokyo 2020, the 24-year-old Feng looks to dream bigger in Paris. China has made steady progress in artistic swimming in recent years, sealing golds in all five Olympic routines at the World Championships in Doha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two candidates reflect our recognition of veteran athletes who persist in their careers, as well as the encouragement to the rising events and youngsters," said Zhang Xin, the secretary-general of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, China has announced a delegation of 716 members, including 405 athletes, for the Paris Olympic Games. 136 male and 269 female athletes will compete in 236 events across 30 sports at the July 26 to August 11 Games. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hang Seng Index fell by about a quarter of a percentage point at the start of trading. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763071_1_20240725103405.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 50.22 points, or 0.29 percent, to open at 17,260.83 points on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Traders are taking a cautious stance ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures price index data, which is the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation and therefore plays a major role in its view on interest rates..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overnight in the US, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2 percent, as lacklustre Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in large company names.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13. (with additional reporting by Xinhua and Reuters)

    Failed tender suggests developers want more incentives

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Private Subsidised Flat Pilot Scheme complements the Home Ownership Scheme by bringing in private developers. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763055_1_20240725094635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services Nicholas Brooke says a failed government tender for a residential plot in Chai Wan on Wednesday didn't provide sufficient incentives for developers to take on the subsidised housing project.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tender for the Cheung Man Road site was withdrawn after only one bid was received which failed to meet the reserve price. It involved 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value - with any unsold units being kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it's not really a developer-type opportunity," said Brooke, who was speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's more a construction play and if they want to involve the development community then there has got to be more incentive. And I think that that incentive would mean that every scheme of this nature would have to include some private sector units as well so the developer would be rewarded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it wants to tender out three sites under its Private Subsidised Flat Pilot Scheme. Announced last year, it is designed to complement the government's Home Ownership Scheme by bringing in private developers to boost building capacity for subsidised homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the private sector should still be involved in subsidised housing construction but that some changes may be needed from the government given the weak property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they need to look at the backcloth and the general conditions in the market very closely before they go to tender with the next site," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The package needs revisiting if you like. We need to involve the private sector in the production of subsidised housing so the scheme is important. But I think this was a test and I hope the government will learn from that and fine tune, if you like, the next proposal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it will continue to assess the market’s development, and may adjust the pilot scheme’s parameters, and future tender arrangements for sites, if such actions are found to be necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it would continue to encourage private developers to participate in the pilot scheme under the private land approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the scheme, land can be developed through public tendering or through the use of private land.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to France said the Paris Olympics will further boost sports and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK in Paris, Lu Shaye said China and France can leverage the Games and work together in sharing sports resources and training young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On one hand, China and France can strengthen cooperation on sharing resources on sports where each country excels, like table tennis and diving for China and football and fencing for France,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, we can also promote sports education cooperation, encouraging Chinese and French primary and secondary school students to go to each other's country to join summer and winter sports camps.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu also said themed exhibitions will be held at the China House in Paris during the Olympic Games to showcase Chinese cultural traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France. Lu said talks between President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in May brought relations to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two sides issued a total of four joint statements, on the situation in the Middle East, artificial intelligence, global governance and biodiversity... Nearly 20 bilateral cooperation documents were signed. The China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has been further consolidated and deepened,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The envoy added that Hong Kong plays an important role in promoting people-to-people exchanges between China and France.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory says Severe Typhoon Gaemi is moving across the Taiwan Strait and is expected to make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday, maintaining a distance of over 500 kilometres from Hong Kong. It says unless Gaemi adopts a more westerly track after making landfall, the chance of issuing a tropical cyclone warning signal is relatively low.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also says the south-west monsoon over the northern part of the South China Sea will become more active, and depending on the changes in local wind conditions, it will consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal.

 Salt Lake City was formally awarded the 2034 Winter Olympics and Paralympics following a vote Wednesday by the International Olympic Committee in Paris, giving the US state of Utah its second Games after hosting in 2002.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About a thousand sports fans gathered in downtown Salt Lake City in ski gear in the summer heat, while others donned Team USA merchandise and waved flags with the Olympic rings. The crowd erupted in cheers as Olympic officials made their final decision to return to a city where they said the local enthusiasm was palpable even two decades after it first hosted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Utah's capital city was the only candidate for 2034 after the Olympic committee gave Salt Lake City exclusive negotiating rights last year. Climate change and high operational costs have reduced the number of cities willing and able to welcome the Winter Games. (AP)

 Men's tennis number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, days before it begins, after falling ill with tonsillitis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian said he was "sad and disappointed" to drop out, adding that he had started feeling unwell on Monday after a practice week in Monaco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After seeing my doctors on Tuesday and waiting an extra day to give myself some more time to see if my condition would improve, things unfortunately got worse," Sinner, 22, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was looking forward to competing with my teammates and the rest of the Italian team, but for now that will have to wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As advised by my medical team, I will now take some time to rest and recover to full health. I'd like to wish the whole team Italia the best for this important event and hope to be back stronger in the future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sinner said the Olympics had been "one of my main goals for this season" and was due to play in the men's singles and the doubles with Lorenzo Musetti. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said it would consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal or the Standby Signal Number 1 later in the day, depending on the progress of Super Typhoon Gaemi, which is forecast to move across Taiwan and make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said on its website that Gaemi is expected to stay about 600 kilometres from Hong Kong before making landfall over Fujian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned that Gaemi will bring strong offshore winds to Hong Kong later on Thursday and early on Friday, along with temperatures of up to 35 degrees or more in parts of the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi made landfall overnight in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said two people are dead and 201 injured. It's forced the suspension of high-speed railway service, and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes and business operations in 22 counties and cities have been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi exacerbated seasonal rains in the Philippines, triggering flooding and landslides that killed six.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first typhoon to make landfall in Taiwan this year, Gaemi was "expected to be the strongest" one in eight years, a government forecaster told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had caused downpours and strong gusts across Taiwan before its arrival, killing one motorist in southern Kaohsiung city who was crushed by a falling tree, and a woman in eastern Hualien, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 200 people were injured by Wednesday evening, while more than 290,000 homes were plunged into darkness due to power outages, disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By 8:00 pm (1200 GMT) on Wednesday, authorities had evacuated more than 8,000 people living in precarious conditions across Taiwan, particularly in Hualien -- a mountainous area with a high risk of landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trains and ferry services were suspended and hundreds of international and domestic flights were cancelled on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that the impact of the typhoon will be extended to four days (until Friday)," said Taiwan's Central Weather Administration chief Cheng Jia-ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools and offices will remain closed for the second day in a row in several cities -- including Taipei -- with authorities expecting adverse weather to continue across the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi is expected to make its way across the strait later today and hit eastern Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, where authorities have issued a red storm alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi swept past the Philippines, intensifying monsoons that were typical this time of the year and triggering widespread flooding in Manila that turned streets into rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides killed six in provinces surrounding Manila, police and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities in Japan's southern island region of Okinawa urged residents to "exercise strong vigilance" against storms, high waves and floods. (Staff reporter, AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets tumbled on Wednesday following a bruising investor response to earnings from Tesla and Google parent Alphabet that added to worries about tech heavyweight equity valuations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 3.6 percent, or more than 650 points, at 17,342.41.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 percent to 39,853.87, and the S&P 500 dropped 2.3 percent to 5,427.13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downbeat reaction to results "feeds some angst about the mega cap stocks not being able to deliver stock performance," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, adding that even strong results next week from Apple, Amazon and other tech giants may not be received well by Wall Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a general bid to reduce exposure predicated on the idea that these stocks have run up a long way in a short time," O'Hare said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla dropped 12.3 percent after missing earnings estimates as CEO Elon Musk touted progress on robotic and artificial intelligence technology. Analysts said the results added to worries about weakening profit margins amid ebbing demand for Tesla's electric vehicles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sales rate of new family homes in the United States dipped in June, missing analyst estimates amid still elevated interest rates, according to government data released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New home sales in June came in at an annual, seasonally-adjusted, rate of 617,000, according to data released jointly by the US census and housing departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That was below the 621,000 rate in May, according to Wednesday's revised figures, and under the 640,000 projected by analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure refers to the number of homes sold over a whole year if sales continue at the rate seen in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median price in June was US$417,3000, up 2.5 percent from the prior reading.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data follows a report that also showed a drop in sales of previously-owned homes that also missed analyst estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The June report on top of the weak May data show the "spring bounce in sales appears to have reversed," said a note from Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mortgage rates currently stand below their four-week and 52-week average, according to Freddie Mac.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, interest rates remain well above their levels for most of the last decade following a series of large Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to counter inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect that a reduction in the Fed's benchmark lending rate later this year will help mortgage rates decline further, boosting home sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New home sales are expected "to improve slightly" in the second half of the year, according to a note from Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mortgage rates have fallen nearly 50 basis points to about 6.75 percent since early May and we expect rates to fall further as the Fed's rate cutting cycle gets underway," said the Oxford Economics note. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Morroco fans threw water bottles on to the pitch after Argentina scored their second goal. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763020_2_20240725081807.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chaos and confusion reigned on Wednesday as Morocco beat Argentina 2-1 in their opening game of the men's Olympic football tournament, but only after a late equaliser for the South American side was disallowed and the final minutes were played out in an empty stadium following crowd trouble.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Argentina thought they had escaped from the Group B match in Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw when Cristian Medina scored in the 16th minute of added time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But as their players celebrated, projectiles including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was completely unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium by now emptied of spectators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medina's goal was eventually disallowed for offside following a VAR review, and Morocco held on for all three points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was an undignified start to the sporting action at the Paris Games, and a bad day all round for Argentina, whose players were booed as they emerged onto the pitch and during the national anthem by the crowd, most of whom were supporting Morocco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That welcome came after Argentina players were filmed singing racist chants following their victory in the recent Copa America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a circus," complained Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At no point did they tell us our goal was not valid... this would not even happen in a neighbourhood tournament. It's pathetic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beyond the Olympic spirit, the organisation needs to be up to standard. At the moment it is not, unfortunately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina are looking to win men's football gold for the third time after success in 2004 and 2008, but Mascherano's side trailed 2-0 following a brace by Soufiane Rahimi. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Loganimasi Ponipate of Fiji scores in the Rugby Sevens men’s Pool C match between Fiji and Uruguay at Stade de France. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763019_1_20240725001123.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France struggled to live up to pre-tournament billing as favourites for Olympic Gold in rugby sevens on Wednesday, held to a 12-12 draw by the United States to the disappointment of a packed Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, double Olympic champions Fiji burnished their own title credentials, swatting aside Uruguay 40-12 with typical Fijian flair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Les Bleus side featuring Antoine Dupont, arguably the world's greatest 15-a-side player, were left to rue several errors in possession that opened the door for their lesser-ranked opponents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France opened their account halfway through the first half, a brilliant offload out of contact releasing Jordan Sepho for a try in the corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the home crowd was stunned into silence just before the half-time whistle as US flyer Lucas Lacamp broke through the French defence for a long-range effort that earned his team a 7-5 lead at the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France restored their advantage practically from the kick-off in the second half, Rayan Rebbadj powering over after a move that started with a clever Dupont offload.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a powerful American counter-ruck after France were caught isolated deep in their half allowed Marcus Tupuola to stroll in for a try that secured them a deserved draw.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We lacked precision, especially close to the try line. We were knocked back a lot, especially at the start of the match," said France captain Paulin Riva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We didn't manage to finish, messed up every time we should have finished," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result blows open pool C, which also features Fiji, always a force in sevens despite a disappointing season by their standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With trademark free-flowing rugby, the Fijians had far too much pace and power for Uruguay, a Joji Nasova first-half double killing off the match as a contest before the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Americans put up a spirited effort, however, with two tries of their own but were no match for Fiji who laid down an impressive marker to the rest of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Australia squeezed past a determined Samoa side 21-14, courtesy of a Henry Hutchison double to get their pool B campaign off to a winning start.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other pool B match saw Argentina roundly booed by the home faithful before running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France were billed as the team to beat in the men's competition, with superstar Dupont one of the pin-ups of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fiji have won both Olympic Golds since the sport was introduced at the Rio Games in 2016 and showed they will be no pushover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fiji and France will face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a "coming of age" moment for the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport," Gilpin said ahead of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold. (AFP)

    Natural regeneration of forests often better: study

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Countries have pledged to plant billions of trees to tackle climate change, but half the time letting forests regenerate naturally would be a better option, a major study said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are places where it makes sense to plant trees, and there are places where it makes sense to naturally regenerate forests," Jacob Bukoski, one of the authors of the study told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you want to sequester carbon at the lowest cost, some combination of natural regeneration and plantations makes a lot of sense," said the researcher at Oregon State University in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Restoring forests has massive potential to help limit rising global temperatures because trees absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study, which spanned 138 countries and was published in the journal Nature Climate Change, compared the cost and climate benefits of planting one tree species in an area or allowing natural forest regrowth -- two common reforestation approaches --- over a 30-year period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that in 46 percent of the studied areas, letting forests grow back naturally was the more cost-effective option. The rest of the time, plantations were found to be cheaper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It suggests that the current heavier emphasis on plantations within national reforestation programmes could be leading to missed opportunities for cost-effective climate mitigation," the study said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous research has shown that as much as two-thirds of reforestation commitments in the tropics are plantations, said Bukoski.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years there has been "a proliferation of single species plantations to try to meet climate goals," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fast-growing single species plantations -- also called monoculture -- are more costly to implement but provide revenue from the production and sale of wood products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When the wood is harvested, a portion of the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere -- but the rest is trapped in the timber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Naturally regenerated forests grow more slowly but are more biodiverse and store a greater amount of carbon over a longer time period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said their mapping could help guide international initiatives and countries' plans to cut emissions by presenting a more nuanced approach to reforestation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found that natural regeneration was especially cost-effective in much of western Mexico, the Andean region, the Southern Cone of South America, west and central Africa, India, southern China, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conversely, plantations proved the better option in large parts of the Caribbean, Central America, Brazil, north, east and southern Africa, northern China, mainland Southeast Asia and the Philippines. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People wait to collect food from a soup kitchen in Omdurman in Sudan. A new report from UN agencies says about 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763015_1_20240724234356.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conflict, economic turbulence and extreme weather scuppered efforts to curb hunger last year, with around nine percent of the world's population affected, UN agencies said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  About 733 million people may have faced hunger in 2023, a level that has held steady for three years after a steep rise following the Covid-19 pandemic, they said in a report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the picture is uneven. While hunger affected one in every five people in Africa, compared with a global average of one in 11, Latin America and the Caribbean progressed and Asia stalled in the goal of eliminating undernourishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broader goal of securing regular access to adequate food for everyone also stalled in that period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate or severe food insecurity, which forces people to occasionally skip meals, hit 2.33 billion people last year -- almost 29 percent of the global population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization suggests the UN goal of a world without hunger by 2030 is fading further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conflicts, climate chaos and economic downturns are already known as major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition that combine with underlying factors including persistent inequality, the unaffordability of healthy diets and unhealthy food environments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But these major drivers are becoming more frequent and intense -- and occurring concurrently more often -- meaning more people are exposed to hunger and food insecurity, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A healthy diet was unaffordable for more than one third of the world's population in 2022, the report added, citing updated estimates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here too regional inequalities were stark: more than 71 percent of people in low-income countries could not afford healthy diets, compared with just over six percent in high-income nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to David Laborde, an economist at the Food and Agriculture Organization and one of the report's authors, the post-Covid economic rebound was unequal within and between countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wars and extreme weather events also raged unabated in 2023, but the world has failed to put in place a "Marshall Plan" to bolster funds earmarked for fighting hunger, he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN agencies' report, which was presented for a G20 summit in Brazil, suggested a major reform of financing food security and nutrition to alleviate the scourge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This would start with adopting common definitions putting all actors on the same page. According to current estimates, between $176 billion and $3,975 billion are needed to eradicate hunger by 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yet the "highly fragmented" financial architecture "makes the scale-up and effective implementation of financing for food security and nutrition unfeasible", the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Donors, international agencies, NGOs and foundations must coordinate better as the current set-up lacks shared priorities and is characterised by "an over-proliferation of actors delivering mostly small, short-term projects", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Food security and nutrition is not simply a question of "distributing bags of rice in emergency situations", Laborde said, but also aid to small-scale farmers and access to energy in rural areas that could electrify irrigation systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another weakness of the current system is that donor intentions do not always meet the needs of populations, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Debates over animal husbandry in some European countries may discourage investment in intensifying it in Africa, which is necessary, said Laborde. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four teenagers have been arrested after suspicious chemicals and weapons were found on a hillside near a vocational school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers on Wednesday said the four secondary school pupils, aged between 13 and 15, knew each other, with one of them being a suspected triad member. They were detained for allegedly conspiring to make explosives and possessing them, among other offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they acted upon receiving a report from the Kwun Tong branch of the Institute of Vocational Education, adding that officers found 90 containers with suspected chemicals at the scene. Police also seized weapons and a number of laboratory equipment like beakers and alcohol burners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the motives of those arrested, whether it involved anything political or if they were manipulated by others, and whether there were any other accomplices besides the four, these are what the police are extremely concerned about," said senior superintendent Eileen Chung of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that suspected explosives were found in the residence of one of the suspects.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Lands Department said it had rejected the sole bid received for the residential site in Chai Wan. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762994_1_20240724180330.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday announced that it had failed to sell a residential site in Chai Wan, after receiving only one tender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lands Department said it had rejected the sole bid, as it did not meet the government's reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site on Cheung Man Road was the first put up for public tender under a pilot scheme for private developers to help build subsidised units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site under tender was for not less than 700 residential units, which should be sold at 65 percent of the market price, along with care homes for the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, officials said they would not speculate on why the price was not met, adding many factors, such as market conditions and company strategies, played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added it would continue to provide more subsidised housing and enrich the housing ladder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also keep in view the market development, and review in due course if there is a need to adjust some of the key parameters of the Pilot Scheme as well as future tender arrangements for sites under the Pilot Scheme," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also continue to encourage private developers to participate in the Pilot Scheme under the private land approach."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government sold a plot in Sha Tin for HK$619 million, the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.

 Police say they are investigating a murder, arson and attempted suicide case in Central in which a woman died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it received multiple reports of fire and smoke coming out of a flat on Kotewall Road at around 1pm on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After forcibly opening the door and putting out the fire, officers found a 57-year-old woman in the living room and her 66-year-old husband in the bathroom. They were taken to hospital where the woman was pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Initial investigation revealed that the man is suspected of setting the unit on fire in a suicide attempt, which led to the death of his wife who was in the same unit,” the police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A suicide note and suspected accelerant, which are believed to be related to the case, were seized at scene.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said a post-mortem will be carried out to determine what caused the woman’s death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two firemen, meanwhile, felt unwell and were sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they had arrested 44 people in an operation targeting illegal workers and the use of e-bikes for delivery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This includes 36 non-Chinese who hold temporary identification documents which bar them from working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven account holders were also arrested for providing their accounts to the illegal workers, so that they could take orders or deliver takeaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also found that the arrested account holders come from the same place as the deliverymen, or are their friends, and that they had lent out their accounts," said Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police revealed that delivery platforms had agreed to terminate riders' accounts if workers were found to have committed illegal acts, including the use of e-bikes or seriously breaching traffic regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities also reached out to building management offices to remind security guards to register the couriers' information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said security staff should contact police immediately if the deliverymen do not have ID cards.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong Shopping Festival will take place from August 1-31.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday unveiled details of the inaugural Hong Kong Shopping Festival which aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) expand their reach in the mainland's e-commerce market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the mainland's online retail sales hitting 15.4 trillion renminbi (US$2.12 trillion) in the past year – a year on year increase of 11 percent – the festival provides an opportunity for Hong Kong businesses to tap into the booming market, allowing SMEs to leverage extensive visitor traffic and diverse customer bases to enhance their visibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will feature over 230 brands offering discounts across categories such as apparel, food, personal care products and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKTDC Assistant Executive Director Stephen Liang said the initiative will provide SMEs with practical experience in navigating the mainland's e-commerce landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very good opportunity for [SMEs] to learn about how the mainland e-commerce operates and at the same time introduce them to more KOLs to create exposure," Liang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will take place for the entire month of August and will include large digital promotions on platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, as well as live-stream events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland e-commerce platforms, they have different ways to market their products, they use different slogans ... and different ways to drive traffic," said Liang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday hosted his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Guangzhou, with both sides calling for peace amid the war between Ukraine and Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kuleba said he is seeking common ground in talks with Wang on ending the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign minister said Kyiv "also wants to follow the path of peace, recovery, and development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang called for the healthy and steady development of ties between China and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two countries established their strategic partnership more than a decade ago, and have treated each other with mutual respect and equality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the pair exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the conditions and timing are not yet mature, we support all efforts that contribute to peace and are willing to continue to play a constructive role for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks," Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has always been firmly committed to promoting a political solution to the crisis," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba's four-day visit to China, which began on Tuesday, is the first by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the war started in 2022. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An Oscar-winning visual effects production company, which produced visual effects for Hollywood blockbuster films like “Titanic” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”, is establishing an AI research centre at the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Digital Domain has previously won 11 Academy Awards, including three "Best Visual Effects", and eight "Scientific and Technical Achievement" Oscars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre's establishment ceremony on Wednesday, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong hailed the new partnership between the HKSP and Digital Domain as a "significant milestone in digital entertainment" and a huge boost to the SAR's creative sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IT minister noted that AI has transformed the way movies, animations, and visual effects were made, and believes the partnership will revolutionise the SAR's entertainment industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Digital Domain is a testament to this, with its groundbreaking use of AI technology as a tool for better storytelling and immersion. By harnessing the power of AI, we can create truly exceptional products that push the boundaries of imagination," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the future we envision for the film and entertainment industry, where humans and AI work hand-in-hand to create unforgettable experiences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology minister also interacted with a lifelike AI-generated image of the late singer Teresa Teng during a demonstration session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the SAR government is well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges arising from AI and will offer all sorts of support to develop the technology in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Digital Domain’s CEO Daniel Seah said he dreams of building a “Hollywood of China” in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe we can help the Hong Kong film market...over the past 30 years we have accumulated lots of data and digital assets. All these will be used in machine learning and deep learning in the research centre at Science Park,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have the ability and resources to bring back amazing films here.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali officials said at least 18 people were killed when a small plane crashed and caught fire while it was taking off from Nepal's capital Kathmandu on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Saurya Airlines flight was carrying two crew and 17 of the company's staff members for a test flight, Nepali police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pilot has been rescued and is being treated. It is not possible to confirm the status of others on board right now. Many have not survived," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane crashed at around 11:15 am local time, the military said in a statement, adding the army's quick response team had been lending assistance with rescue efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  News portal Khabarhub reported the airplane had caught fire after skidding on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plane was scheduled to fly on Nepal's most trafficked air route between Kathmandu and Pokhara, an important tourism hub in the Himalayan republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saurya Airlines exclusively flies Bombardier CRJ 200 jets, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance -- issues compounded by the mountainous republic's treacherous geography. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third Side on Wednesday called for Chief Executive John Lee to introduce new ways for young people to contribute to society in his policy address later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We encourage the government to open up more opportunities, and in other social activities, encourage them and give them some support and subsidy, encourage them to design some creative activities, and through social activities, engage the young people in community affairs," the party's chairman Tik Chi-yuen said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party called for vouchers for those aged 16 to 35 to buy tickets for events or to take part in cultural activities, as well as for HK$100 million to be spent each year on paying for young artists to develop businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side also called for universal suffrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Basic Law, the Central government promised direct elections for CE and Legislative Council members. We are looking for democracy in Hong Kong. This is also the responsibility of the SAR government. Like Article 23, they take up the responsibility to create the atmosphere to allow the movement of democracy in Hong Kong," Tik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that people's livelihoods, economic development and democracy complement each other.

    'More support needed for ethnic minority elderly'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKCS says more resources should be put into making mainstream care services more accessible for elderly people who come from ethnic minority groups. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762958_1_20240724150608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS) on Wednesday said more than half of ethnic minority carers lack confidence in mainstream care services, according to its survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The organisation conducted the survey from November to April this year, and collected 250 questionnaires, 200 from elderly folk and 50 from carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 10 being the highest confidence level, over half of ethnic minority carers gave only 1 to 5 to mainstream care services. Almost 90 percent of elderly and carers have never used mainstream care services which are mainly provided by the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Viola Tsang, HKSC's service head, said this was worrying especially given the population of  ethnic minority elderly people in Hong Kong was expected to increase by 160 percent, according to population census data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jackie Chan, supervisor of HKCS's Centre for Research & Development, said that among the small 10 percent who had used mainstream services, almost 30 percent said the language barrier was very problematic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This sentiment was echoed by Nanda, a 33-year-old Nepali women, who said that notices should be offered in English as well, especially for important information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang added that pre-existing translation copies were not sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More audio broadcasts or even to translate the public information into easy-to-read and simple ways in different ethnic languages is also very helpful for them to access the public service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other recommendations by HKCS include more bridging services, multicultural sensitivity training for mainstream care providers, and an ethnic minority specialised team with more ethnic minority staff.

<div class="itemFullText">
 C15+ lawmakers on Wednesday urged the government to develop e-sports as part of their suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices, lawmaker William Wong called on the authorities to consider giving e-sports "elite sport" status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that Hong Kong gamers secured a silver medal in an e-sports event at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing well in the Asian Games… but when we do our research, we've realised that the parents are actually undermining a little bit about the potential of the sport itself. So I think the first thing the government has to do is to change the image of e-sports and preferably, at some point in time, actually make e-sports as one of the elite sports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the gaming industry benefits the city’s economy, adding that the sector is projected to generate US$1.8 billion in income by 2027, up from US$1.4 billion in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Andrew Lam urged the CE to use Hong Kong's intangible heritage to promote tourism and boost the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I particularly mentioned about the conservation of our countryside, revitalisation of our villages. Because actually it's the best kind of real experience, apart from the very busy urban area that tourists and also our local visitors could have a deeper understanding and appreciation of our cultural origin. It's not just about Hong Kong, it's also about Chinese story," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third policy address in October.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Belarus's top diplomat arrived in Pyongyang for a four-day visit, North Korean state media said Wednesday, as the two heavily sanctioned countries look to deepen ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At the invitation of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, Maxim Ruzenkov, foreign minister of the Republic of Belarus, arrived here on Tuesday to pay an official visit," the official Korean Central News Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov's trip comes as the two states strengthened ties with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea will "deepen ties with Minsk on all fronts to open a new era of improved relationships," Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said at a dinner welcoming the Belarusian delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruzenkov was reported as saying Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un both hoped to nurture a closer relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, the European Union agreed on new sanctions against Belarus over its role in the Ukraine war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his first visit to North Korea in 24 years and signed a strategic treaty with leader Kim, including a commitment to come to each other's aid if attacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul and Washington have accused North Korea of supplying ammunition and missiles to Russia for its war, and the new treaty has fuelled fears of more deliveries. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from two landslides in southern Ethiopia has jumped to 229 and could rise further as the search for survivors and casualties continued into a second day, a government official said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following heavy rain, a landslide buried people in Gofa zone in Southern Ethiopia regional state on Sunday night, then a second one engulfed others who had gathered to help on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't know when it will stop. We are still recovering bodies," Markos Melese, head of the National Disaster Response agency in Gofa Zone, told Reuters by phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are still digging."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday an official said at least 50 people had died and children and police officers were among the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage shared by the local administration showed people digging up bodies with shovels and bare hands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The death toll surged after the people who came to rescue also got trapped," said Gofa district administrator Misikir Mitiku. "It is a very sad incident."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he was deeply saddened by the terrible loss of life, and that federal officials had been deployed to reduce the impact of the disaster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We stand in strong solidarity with the people and Government of Ethiopia as rescue efforts continue to find the missing and assist the displaced," African Union chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat wrote on the social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is Ethiopian, said he was thinking of all the families affected and that a WHO team had been sent to support immediate health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the region continues to face the harsh impacts of climate change, we urge everyone to stay vigilant and follow safety protocols to protect lives and prevent further tragedies," said Workneh Gebeyehu, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc.

    Balloon trash falls on S Korea presidential palace

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Trash-carrying balloons sent by North Korea hit the South Korean presidential compound Wednesday prompting Seoul to mobilise chemical response teams. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762928_1_20240724114054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Trash from at least one North Korean balloon fell on the South Korean presidential compound on Wednesday, raising worries about the security of key South Korean facilities from North Korean provocations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the first time the South Korean leader's office in downtown Seoul, which is protected by scores of soldiers and a no-fly zone, had been directly hit by any of the thousands of trash-carrying balloons launched by Pyongyang since May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chemical, biological and radiological (warfare) response team has safely collected the trash balloons," the presidential security service told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After investigation, results have confirmed that there were no danger or contamination of the object," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But experts said South Korea needs to shoot incoming North Korean balloons at border areas next time, as it was not clear whether North Korea would put in hazardous items in future campaigns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea's latest balloon launches came days after South Korea boosted its frontline broadcasts of K-pop songs and propaganda messages across the rivals’ heavily armed border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their tit-for-tat Cold War-style campaigns are inflaming tensions, with the rivals threatening stronger steps and warning of grave consequences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seoul officials earlier said North Korea had used the direction of winds to fly balloons toward South Korea, but some of the past balloons had timers that were likely meant to pop the bags of trash midair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The security service gave no further details about the rubbish found at the presidential compound, like whether balloons were discovered along with the trash. (Agencies)

 The Hang Seng Index fell 14.93 points, or 0.09 percent, to open at 17,454.43 points on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US central bank's monetary policy is back in focus ahead of Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data - the Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the US, attention turned to corporate earnings, with Google parent Alphabet and electric carmaker Tesla both reporting results after Wall Street closed on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In its earnings, Tesla reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profits due to the effect of price cuts, while Alphabet beat revenue and profit expectations as its cloud and search ads businesses thrived. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

    Lawmaker calls for longer transitional site tenancies

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Andrew Lam says many transitional housing residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762901_1_20240724095341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Andrew Lam is calling on the government to make sure transitional housing projects can remain on their sites for longer, saying many residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing, like subdivided flats, once the tenancy is up.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam made the comment after commissioning a survey of residents who had moved from inadequate housing to transitional housing. He said half of those surveyed feared returning to inadequate housing and this was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All this transitional housing is run by NGOs on temporary allocation of land. So the original policy is that this housing will cover five to a maximum of seven years," Lam said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Including the construction period... a lot of them only have three years' operation time so that's the key problem with the transitional housing arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam believes the situation is slightly better for light public housing but that a lot of these sites were a kind of charity by landowners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been promoting transitional housing development through the use of short-term vacant land and premises. In 2020, the Housing Bureau set up a scheme to support transitional housing projects by NGOs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Light public housing is more government-driven and uses both government and private land. The modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address, are also designed to house those on the public rental housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of both transitional housing and light public housing remain on the public rental housing list as before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he commissioned an independent company for his survey and that it covered 14 operating transitional housing estates. He said there were over 350 responses.

    Security beefed up in Paris ahead of Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Paris Olympics are just around the corner and authorities in France are not taking any chances on security, as the national terrorist alert remains at the highest level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police from France and dozens of other countries, alongside local security personnel, have been deployed to patrol major landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées in the days leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the Olympic opening ceremony will be held outdoors, with about 300,000 spectators expected to gather along the Seine River for the spectacular show on Friday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of their arrangements, French authorities have set up security perimetres, known as “grey zones”, near the river, and tourists will need to apply for a QR code in advance for entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The police presence around the Olympic venues and events is very strong, and implementations of the red and grey zones to block of pedestrians and vehicle traffic as they see fit. I guess they are good, even though I can’t really walk the Seine right now because I don’t have a grey pass,” American tourist Mitchell Hasenpflug told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takehiro Kinoshita, who travelled with his family from Japan to watch the skateboarding event, said he was surprised to see how clean and prepared the city is for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel all the time safe 'cause you see all the police around the corner, and it’s amazing so I cannot complain,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not everyone's amused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local resident, Dominique, said traffic is getting worse with restricted zones and an influx of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s terrible, but we didn’t have the choice either… but no, of course you have inconvenience for these Olympic Games.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some businesses located in the sealed-off areas said they too are feeling the pinch, complaining about fewer customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also said they are closing for a few days until after the opening ceremony on July 26.

 Polish high jumper Norbert Kobielski has been provisionally suspended for doping just days before the Paris Olympics, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old, who has a personal best of 2.33 metres, finished 10th at last year's world championships in Budapest and sixth at the European championships in Rome last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kobielski has left the Polish Olympic delegation in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AIU said he had tested positive for the banned "pentedrone norephedrine metabolite".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening ceremony for the 2024 Olympics takes place on Friday along the river Seine, although the men's high jump qualifying will not be held until August 7, with the final three days later. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 British dressage star Charlotte Dujardin withdrew from the Paris Olympics on Tuesday after a video emerged allegedly showing her mistreating a horse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dujardin, a three-time Olympic champion and the joint most-decorated British woman Olympian, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) suspended her with immediate effect, just days before the start of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The governing body said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This video was submitted to the FEI by a lawyer representing an undisclosed complainant," the FEI added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information received, the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during a training session conducted by Ms Dujardin at a private stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The FEI said Dujardin had confirmed she was depicted in the video and had acknowledged that her conduct was "inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said she had asked to be provisionally suspended pending the outcome of the investigations and voluntarily withdrew from the Paris Olympics. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street finished a choppy session slightly lower on Tuesday as investors assessed mixed earnings reports while monitoring the fast-changing US presidential contest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lockheed Martin, Spotify and Sherwin-Williams rallied, while General Motors and UPS both fell on a busy day of second-quarter corporate results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briefing.com said of the overall muted market reaction that there was "not a lot of conviction" after Monday's solid rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.1 percent at 40,358.09.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,555.71, and the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 17,997.35.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than two days after President Joe Biden pulled out of the November election, Vice President Kamala Harris hit the campaign trail in the battleground state of Wisconsin as she continued to lock up major endorsements from Democratic officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts expect the stock market to monitor the race more intensely closer to the November election date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, UPS sank more than 12.1 percent as it reported lower profits and revenues and cut some annual projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM dropped 6.4 percent despite reporting profits that topped estimates. Analysts noted that the automaker had seen shares appreciate significantly heading into the report and also pointed to weakness in its China business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Spotify jumped 12 percent as it announced that it added seven million paid subscribers in the second quarter, beating forecasts after it raised prices. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris addresses voters in Wisconsin, one of several Rust Belt states that are crucial to the Democrats' chances of defeating Donald Trump. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762880_1_20240724034802.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over Trump, the Republican nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "In this campaign, I promise you I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week," she told a cheering crowd of several thousands at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state in the November 5 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?" she asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris led Trump 44 percent to 42 percent among registered voters in the national Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Previous surveys taken before Biden's exit found Harris and Trump tied at 44 percent a week ago and Trump ahead of her by a percentage point at the beginning of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In all three cases, the difference was within the poll's 3-point margin of error, but the results could signal some limited movement in Democrats' direction - and may suggest that Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump may have gained from last week's Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump or to serve for another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next month's party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans' household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including Wisconsin and the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Wisconsin event offered another opportunity for Harris, the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, to reset the Democrats' campaign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris has been raking in campaign contributions. Her campaign said on Monday she had raised US$100 million since Sunday, topping the US$95 million that the Biden campaign had in the bank at the end of June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical for Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are independents and young people who did not like their choices, and Harris has a chance to win them," said Paul Kendrick, executive director of the Democratic group Rust Belt Rising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, a Democrat, said Harris could also help bring back crucial Black voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of them didn't come along because they were distracted by his (Biden's) age, distracted by his appearance," he said. (Reuters)

    North American sales help cushion GM from China woes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Strong North American sales helped offset weakness in China, with General Motors reporting US$2.9 billion in quarterly profit. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762879_1_20240724034127.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 General Motors reported higher profits on Tuesday behind another round of strong North American auto sales, with executives vowing a flexible approach to electric vehicle (EV) investment while demand growth ebbs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The major US automaker's second-quarter results demonstrated a continued lift from robust pricing in its home market, thanks to healthy demand for trucks that has made up for weakness in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM, like fellow Michigan automaker Ford, has slowed down its EV build-out, pushing back another project even as company officials emphasized a long-term commitment to the strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence," said Chief Executive Mary Barra, pointing to third-party studies showing slower EV growth in the coming period compared with the last few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Profits came in at US$2.9 billion, up 14 percent from the year-ago period while revenues rose seven percent to US$48 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM increased some of its full-year projections based on the results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North American auto sales rose compared with the year-ago period, with the company enjoying still-strong vehicle pricing that has lasted longer than analysts expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Barra, in a letter to shareholders, pointed to "consistently high performing portfolio of ICE (internal combustion engine) trucks and SUVs on a volume, share and margin basis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM continued to struggle in China, where competition among car companies is high and the company suffered a second consecutive quarterly loss in equity income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competitors are "prioritizing production over profitability," said Barra, who plans to revamp a joint venture with Chinese company SAIC in hopes of a turnaround.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you get into the type of pricing where that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom," Barra said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM noted that the company's Cruise autonomous vehicles service has returned to the road in three cities -- Phoenix, Dallas and Houston -- after a pause due to safety issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cruise is employing a driverless taxi model in these three cities, with a safety driver present to take over if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company has not resumed service in California. Authorities halted testing of Cruise vehicles in the state in October 2023 following a series of accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  GM accounted for US$605 million in costs in the second quarter due to a production halt on the Cruise Origin, which had been planned as a fully autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel. (AFP)

    New world heat record set in July: Copernicus

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Climate change is causing more frequent extreme weather events, including heatwaves and prolonged droughts. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762877_1_20240724025615.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 July 21 was the hottest day ever registered globally, according to preliminary data published Tuesday by the EU's climate monitor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said the global average surface air temperature of 17.09 degrees Celsius (62.7 degrees Fahrenheit) on Sunday was the warmest in their record books, which go back to 1940.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as heatwaves and wildfires ravage swathes of Europe and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Earth has just experienced its warmest day," the monitor said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new daily high was 0.01 degree Celsius above the previous record temperature of 17.08 registered on July 6, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On July 21st, C3S recorded a new record for the daily global mean temperature," C3S director Carlo Buontempo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now in truly uncharted territory and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though just a tiny rise above the previous record, what was "truly staggering" was the streak of unprecedented global heat recorded over the past 13 months, Buontempo added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every month since June 2023 has eclipsed its own temperature record compared to the same month in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Copernicus said in this context, and at the peak of the northern hemisphere summer, it was not "completely unexpected" that this new daily high would be breached.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be eclipsed by the soaring heat experienced earlier this week, the monitor said, pointing to a streak of record-breaking days that occurred in July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global temperatures were expected to peak and drop soon though there could be further fluctuations in coming weeks, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Climate change is causing longer, stronger and more frequent extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, and this year has been marked by major disasters across the globe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deadly heatwaves have already hit North America, Mexico, India and Thailand this year, to name a few, while flooding has devastated parts of East Africa, China and Brazil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wildfires are torching a path across southern and eastern Europe and in Canada and the United States as prolonged scorching temperatures in parts of the northern hemisphere make conditions tinder dry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The burning of fossil fuels is the primary driver of global warming but emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases keep rising, despite international efforts to switch to clean energy and slow rising temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2023 was the hottest year on record and 2024 could follow in step considering the "sufficiently warm" temperatures experienced to date, Copernicus said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was "too early to predict with confidence" which would be hotter between the years, it added. (AFP)

    Secret Service head quits after shooting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Former US president and the Republican Party's presidential candidate, Donald Trump, sustained a two-centimetre wound on his right ear in the assassination attempt. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762875_1_20240724015556.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned on Tuesday, a day after acknowledging that the agency failed in its mission to prevent an assassination attempt against Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheatle was facing bipartisan calls to step down after a 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is overdue, she should have done this at least a week ago," Mike Johnson, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, told reporters. "I'm happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden thanked Cheatle for her nearly three decades in the Secret Service and said she had "selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all know what happened that day can never happen again," Biden said in a statement. "As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new director soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle appeared before a congressional oversight committee on Monday and said the attack on Trump, who was slightly wounded in his right ear, represented a failure by the Secret Service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She called it "the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Republicans and Democrats called on Cheatle to resign during a tense hearing. She drew the ire of lawmakers from both parties by refusing to provide specific details about the attack, citing the existence of multiple active investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Perched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investigators have concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 50 miles (80 kilometres) from Butler, acted alone, and have not been able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two rally attendees were seriously wounded in the attack and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's former physician said over the weekend that the Republican candidate sustained a two-centimetre gunshot wound on his right ear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The bullet passed, coming less than a quarter of an inch from entering his head, and struck the top of his right ear," said ex-White House physician Ronny Jackson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle served as a Secret Service agent for 27 years before leaving in 2021 to become the head of security in North America for PepsiCo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was named to head the agency by President Joe Biden in 2022. (AFP)

    Sporting bodies take Fifa to EU watchdog

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Football's world governing body has been accused of taking "unilateral decisions" and of conduct that "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance". File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762874_1_20240724014908.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two major bodies representing footballers and football clubs in Europe are filing a complaint to the European Commission accusing FIFA of abusing its position.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Football's world governing body has taken "unilateral decisions" and its conduct "infringes EU competition law and notably constitutes an abuse of dominance", FIFPro Europe and the European Leagues body said in a statement on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFPro is the global players' union while European Leagues brings together more than one thousand clubs from 33 countries around Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They say FIFA's conduct with regards to the international match calendar has "harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players" and argue FIFA's role as a regulator and competition organiser is a conflict of interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA has been accused of a failure to consult over recent changes to the calendar, such as the introduction of a 32-team Club World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first edition of the expanded Club World Cup is set to take place in the United States in June and July next year and 12 European clubs are due to feature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many of the continent's leading players will therefore be obliged to participate at a time when they would otherwise have been afforded a long close-season break, a year ahead of the expanded 48-team World Cup in North America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The international match calendar is now beyond saturation and has become unsustainable for national leagues and a risk for the health of players," FIFPro and European Leagues said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "FIFA's decisions over the last years have repeatedly favoured its own competitions and commercial interests, neglected its responsibilities as a governing body, and harmed the economic interests of national leagues and the welfare of players.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "National leagues and player unions, which represent the interests of all clubs and all players at the national level, and regulate labour relations through collectively agreed solutions, cannot accept that global regulations are decided unilaterally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legal action is now the only responsible step for European leagues and player unions to protect football, its ecosystem and its workforce from FIFA's unilateral decisions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement refers to the Super League judgement from the European Court of Justice last December, which required FIFA and other governing bodies to exercise their regulatory functions in a way that is transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA's conduct over the calendar, they allege, "falls well short of these requirements".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain's La Liga, which is not a member of European Leagues, has also joined the complaint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after England's Professional Footballers' Association and their French counterparts, the UNFP, launched an action in the Belgian courts in June to ultimately determine whether FIFA's actions had breached players' rights under European Union law. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Philippine government officials have denounced as fake a video purporting to show the country's president, Ferdinand Marcos, inhaling a white powder. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762869_1_20240724001817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A video allegedly showing Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos inhaling a white powder has been denounced as "fake" and "malicious", with investigators on Tuesday presenting close-up images of his ear to prove it was not him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The clip featuring a dark-haired man was part of a video shown at a rally in Los Angeles that was organised by a political group linked to Marcos's predecessor Rodrigo Duterte.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rally was livestreamed on the Facebook page of pro-Duterte broadcaster SMNI in the Philippines early Monday local time, hours before Marcos was due to deliver his annual State of the Nation address to Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is obvious from the video that that is not our president. Their video is fake and obviously not real," Defence Secretary Gilberto Teodoro said Monday, after the video went viral on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teodoro said it was part of a "serious plan to destabilise our government".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video spread rapidly on Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. One Facebook post was viewed at least eight million times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duterte's former spokesman Harry Roque shared it on his Facebook page with a caption in Tagalog reading: "You be the judge".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was viewed 17,000 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police forensic experts held a news conference on Tuesday to prove the man in the video was not the president, presenting photos of Marcos and the unidentified man to compare their facial features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Enlarged images of their faces and right ears were placed side by side to demonstrate that Marcos's ear was larger in proportion to his face and had a different shape to those of the other man, whose ear curled over at the top.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Be it AI (artificial intelligence) or imposter or whatever it was, as far as the (police) is concerned that is not the president," Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos said Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That is a different person based on the ear. That's not even considering the jawline and the entire facial structure," Abalos said, describing the video as "malicious".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Marcos and Duterte families have had a bitter, public falling out as they attempt to shore up their rival support bases and secure key positions ahead of the 2025 mid-term elections. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) on Tuesday said 45 air-conditioners had been delivered to the Olympic village in Paris for SAR athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SF&OC said the move was made after coordination by the SAR government and the liaison office, as well as communication with the organising committee of the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation is one of several that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced that culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung will fly to Paris on Thursday to attend events at the Games and cheer for Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his stay, Yeung will meet with the SAR delegation in the Olympic village and watch competitions featuring Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will return to Hong Kong on July 31.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Russia on Tuesday pushed back against a US warning over their military and economic cooperation in the Arctic, where climate change is opening up greater competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said it acts on the "principles of respect, cooperation, mutual wins and sustainability", adding it's committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States distorts China's Arctic policy and makes thoughtless remarks on China's normal Arctic activities (which are) in accordance with international law," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia "does its part to ensure that the Arctic does not become a territory of discord and tension."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that Russia's cooperation with China "contributes to an atmosphere of stability and predictability" in the Arctic, and their actions were not targeted against other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks said, "We've seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the Arctic commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian energy exploitation in the Arctic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also growing military cooperation, "with Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska," Hicks said as the department released its 2024 Arctic strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington's Arctic strategy describes the area as "a strategically important region" for the US that includes "the northern approaches to the homeland" and "significant US defence infrastructure." (Reporting by AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Briton Andy Murray, the first male tennis player to claim two Olympic singles gold medals, says he will play the final event of his career at the Paris Games before heading into retirement. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762823_1_20240723172540.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former world number one and three-time Grand Slam title winner Andy Murray confirmed on Tuesday that he would retire after the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Arrived in Paris for my last ever tennis tournament @Olympics. Competing for Great Britain have been by far the most memorable weeks of my career and I'm extremely proud to get do it one final time," the 37-year-old wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now ranked at 121, and playing with a metal hip since 2019, Murray suffered ankle damage this year and underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his spine which ruled him out of the singles tournament at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Instead, he played doubles with brother Jamie and was defeated in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray famously ended Britain's 77-year wait for a men's champion at Wimbledon when he triumphed in 2013, defeating career-long rival Novak Djokovic in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a second title in 2016, taking his career majors total to three after breaking his duck at the 2012 US Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray won gold at the 2012 Olympics on an emotional day at the All England Club where he defeated Roger Federer just weeks after he had lost the Wimbledon final to the Swiss on the same Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four years later, he defeated Juan Martin del Potro to become the first player, male or female, to win two Olympic singles golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Murray also led Britain to the Davis Cup in 2015, the country's first in 79 years. (AFP)

    People hunt for bargains on last day of Book Fair

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Hong Kong Book Fair closed on Tuesday, as sellers tried to clear stocks and readers try to hunt for bargains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ernest Kan, Deputy General Manager of Sup Retail (Hong Kong) Limited, said that sales this year were encouraging but more challenging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there are no consumption vouchers offered by the government this year, and so the pocket money of most citizens are tighter."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, Carminna of SmartKids said this year's sales were slightly higher than expected, and she thinks this was because people coming to the book fair were looking for special discounted items, which they did not offer last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Fung from iGlobe Publishing Ltd, which mainly sells travel books, said their new book focusing on Shenzhen has been popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because many people want to go to Shenzhen to play or eat every Saturday, every Sunday. So our book gives them many information on how to have more fun in Shenzhen, so many people come to book fair to buy this one (their book on Shenzhen)."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trade Development Council, which organised the event, said total visitor numbers over the past seven days reached 990,000, similar to last year's figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The book fair continued its tradition of bringing people together through literature, with seminars achieving remarkable popularity and attracting many visitors from mainland China to participate," said the council's acting executive director Sophia Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And on the final day of the book fair, buyers were taking advantage of cheaper prices, particularly with exam practice workbooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them was Miss Song, who estimated that she would spend about HK$10,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "English books here are cheaper than in book stores outside. Because my daughter usually buys English books for about HK$140, but here maybe because the books are slightly older, or they were in stock for a long time, they cost only about HK$40."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, local student Evanna said this year's bargains were not as good as last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prices in the past years were not as expensive, and there also seems to be less variety this year."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="RTHK has learnt that physical education will take up two points in the internal assessment under a revised rubric. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762804_1_20240723154537.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Educators were on Tuesday divided over the idea of grading primary school pupils on sport alongside their academic performance, following reports that physical education (PE) will be included in assessments for secondary school allocation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, schools internally evaluate their students with three rounds of exams in primary five and six under a 38-point system and submit the scores to the Education Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three core subjects – Chinese, English and mathematics – take up nine points each, while general studies account for six. Visual arts take up three points and music two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But RTHK has learnt that authorities are looking to include PE, which will take up two points, while splitting the existing general studies subject into science and humanities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to sources, the core subjects will be lowered to eight points each, with the new humanities and science sections each taking up four points. Visual arts and music will make up two points each in the revised rubric that will add up to 38 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung said the proposed revamp should also take into account pupils with disabilities or chronic illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although it is a good concept, pupils' innate physical attributes vary greatly... Grading them on their performance in physical education may lead to pressure or comparison among them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I suggest schools evaluate pupils' sports performance in the first one or two years of the new assessment, but not submit their scores, because this would allow the education sector to have a more complete mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Wai-lam, the principal of Fung Kai No 1 Primary School, told the same programme that the inclusion could be beneficial to pupils, who he said had been mostly static during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through sports activities, pupils' health will definitely be improved, while reducing the burden on society and healthcare in the future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised system could be in place from the 2026/27 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it is conducting a review and collecting opinions on the changes, and that it will make an announcement in due course.

    1,000 MTR staff deployed for Sunday's partial shutdown

    <![CDATA[<img alt="1,000 MTR staff deployed for Sunday's partial shutdown" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762797_1_20240723150237.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR says it will deploy 1,000 staff members on Sunday when a partial shutdown of the Kwun Tong Line takes place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin will be suspended for the day due to a full maintenance operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maintenance will replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations will still be served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Train frequencies will be changed to accommodate citizens' needs, with Kwun Tong Line waiting times lengthened to five minutes to avoid overcrowding at Prince Edward Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsuen Wan Line trains will be available every 3.5 minutes, while Tuen Ma Line trains will arrive every 5.5 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail operator suggested passengers plan their journeys ahead and make use of alternative railway routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prince Edward Station will be very busy on that day because it will be the only interchange station between Kwun Tong Line and Tsuen Wan Line stations on this coming Sunday. We will provide extra hands, extra staff in the affected stations to help all passengers, [and] we will provide service counters at Prince Edward Station, Whampoa, Ho Man Tin and Yau Ma Tei during peak hours this weekdays and also on the coming Saturday and Sunday for whole day," said Cheris Lee, who heads the MTR's operating and metro segment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowd management measures will be in place at Prince Edward Station from Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, free bus services will run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin, and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus route No.8 that runs from Kowloon Station to Tsim Sha Tsui Pier will be available for free to passengers for the whole journey, while passengers taking route No.30X that runs from Whampoa Gardens to Tsuen Wan Allway Gardens will not need to pay if they board at designated bus stops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both route frequencies will be increased to every 10 minutes, and staff will be present at different bus stops to assist citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there will be different checkpoints along the tunnel, and the company will continuously update the maintenance progress on Sunday so citizens will be informed about traffic conditions on Monday, July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MTR said they are confident that the maintenance would be completed within 28 hours and citizens would be able to use train services as usual the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR expects the Tung Chung Line to be the next to undergo maintenance that will affect train services.

    Hamas, Fatah sign landmark declaration in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi, centre, and members of various Palestinian factions attend the signing of the Beijing Declaration aimed at ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Tuesday announced it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian factions met with the media, with Wang present, CGTN said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in Beijing from July 21-23, CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel last October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," he said following the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the factions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of an SAR delegation which will visit Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos along with Chief Executive John Lee later this month says Hong Kong can play a key role in financing projects in the Southeast Asian countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo Kam-wing, president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, said Hong Kong's professional services have global recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our accounting, financial, taxation, legal, our ESG [environmental, social, and governance] and construction can provide a high quality support for infrastructure development in these countries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can play a key role as an infrastructure financial hub and provide these countries with diversifying financing channels, including equity listing and also syndicate loans, private equity funds, ordinary bonds, etc."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jonathan Choi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said it is significant that Lee will lead the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because as an individual company, we have been there for a long time, nothing special, we do it every day. But this time the CE is coming, then it is different. It shows that the whole Hong Kong or the business community is going to work together with these three countries."

    Let young entrepreneurs use abandoned schools: BPA

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) on Tuesday said the government should let young entrepreneurs operate from abandoned schools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proposal is among the party's suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, BPA chairman Lo Wai-kwok said many schools have shut down recently and the government should make good use of the campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Encouraging the entrepreneurship among our younger generation...one of the concerns is they need offices. They need some space for them to do their research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have some facilities available in the community, so how to make better use of these facilities, of course, is an obvious thing that the government should consider and the government should do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, called on the government to drop duty on spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The loss of income on duties will be offset by the increase in economic activities many, many times. And we are confident that with this reduction of duty to zero, it would help to cheer up - we talk about spirit - the spirit of Hong Kong, the spirit of our citizens," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BPA also suggested the CE loosen the requirements of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme by allowing applicants to include the purchase of residential property.

    'Surge in illegal cigarette ads alarming'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="District leaders concerned total bans on cigarettes will exacerbate illegal advertisement problem. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762787_1_20240723135954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors on Tuesday expressed concern over a surge in illegal cigarette advertisements, with bus stops, trash cans, and shopping mall restrooms becoming hotspots for these illicit promotions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proliferation of these advertisements has prompted calls for stricter enforcement to prevent further distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office must take decisive measures to comprehensively crack down on these activities,” said Sha Tin District Councillor Leung Ka-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government recently proposed 10 short-term tobacco control measures, but another Sha Tin District Councillor, Eddie Lam, cautioned against implementing tobacco restrictions all at once, citing that rash measures could stimulate the black market, pushing more smokers towards illicit cigarettes, and exacerbating the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that the government should implement policies in phases, it might be more effective instead of the 10 short-term policies at the same time,” said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested looking at other overseas practices for reference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments that have implemented flavoured cigarette controls have adopted phased implementation, such as the EU and Canada, which first banned fruit-flavoured cigarettes rather than implementing a blanket ban. The authorities should take this as a reference."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested five men on suspicion of selling fake concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Chan Hoi-leung said three people filed a report after paying between HK$1,500 and HK$3,300 for fake tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police received reports that some people bought tickets online or outside concert venues, using cash or money transfer. When they attempted to enter concert venues, organisers told them that their tickets were... fake," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fake tickets were convincing and included security features such as QR codes and hologram stickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police urged the public to avoid purchasing tickets from unofficial channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 34 and 46, were arrested on suspicion of obtaining property by deception and were being detained for further investigation.

    Harris has growing support of DNC delegates: polls

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762759_1_20240723104050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President Kamala Harris has received the support of enough Democratic delegates to win her party's presidential nomination, CNN and other US media reported late on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Harris will need the support of at least 1,976 pledged delegates out of nearly 4,000 in order to decisively secure the Democratic presidential nomination during an official vote in the coming weeks, a number which US outlets reported she has now surpassed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the Democratic Party plans to push forward with a virtual roll call in which delegates to its convention can choose a presidential nominee before they gather next month in Chicago — despite Harris being overwhelmingly favoured to replace US President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The convention rules committee will meet Wednesday to approve how the virtual roll call will work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It does not list a date for when virtual voting would begin, but Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said the process will be completed by August 7 — or 12 days before the party's convention begins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are living through an unprecedented moment in history and, as a party, we are tackling it with the seriousness that it deserves,” Harrison said on a conference call with reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are prepared to undertake a transparent, swift and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a nominee who represents our values.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Democrats "can, and will, be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden dropped out of the presidential race on Sunday, ending weeks of fighting among Democrats, many of whom feared he was not up to the rigours the campaign — much less a second term — following his poor debate against Repulican nominee Donald Trump last month. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning Olympic silver medalist Marketa Vondrousova withdrew from the Paris Summer Games on Monday due to a hand injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 2023 Wimbledon champion from the Czech Republic lost to Switerland's Belinda Bencic in the gold medal match at the Tokyo Olympics in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova had been planning to play singles as well as doubles with Karolina Muchova. The tennis competition at Roland Garros begins on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was hoping until the last moment that I could go at least in doubles, but problems with my hand won't let me on the court," Vondrousova posted on Instagram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kateřina Siniaková, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in doubles and is a nine-time Grand Slam champion in women's doubles, will replace Vondrousova in the women's singles tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vondrousova, 25, said her focus now shifts to getting healthy in time for next month's U.S. Open, the final grand slam on the 2024 calendar. (Reuters)

    Wall Street jumps as investors return to megacaps

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wall Street finished higher in a strong session for big tech stocks. File image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762727_1_20240723050656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's three benchmarks ended higher on Monday as investors returned to megacap growth stocks, helping both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite recover from their worst weekly performance since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also back in positive territory, breaking a two-session skid since hitting an all-time closing high last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Megacaps Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Tesla all advanced between 2.2 percent and 5.1 percent after being major drags on the market last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nvidia also rose 4.8 percent% after Reuters reported the artificial intelligence chip leader was working on a version of its new flagship AI chips for the China market that would be compliant with current US export controls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think this move today probably has more to do with a rebound from the selling that occurred last week than anything else," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief among the other factors on traders' minds was a re-examination of the state of the presidential race after US President Joe Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy for the November election on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's exit could prompt investors to unwind trades on bets that a victory for Republican Trump would increase US fiscal and inflationary pressures. But some analysts said markets could benefit from an increased chance of a divided government under the next administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump-linked stocks were mixed on Monday, with Trump Media & Technology Group dropping 0.8 percent, while software firm Phunware gained 4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having digested the news of Biden's withdrawal, investors will now be looking for answers to key questions including who will join Harris on the Democratic presidential ticket and to what degree, if any, the vice president will deviate from the platform which Biden was headlining.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.08 percent, at 5,564 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.58 percent, to 18,008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32 percent, to 40,415.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike slumped 13.5 percent, extending losses after a software update from the company sparked Friday's global tech outage. (Reuters)

 Tour de France champion Tadej Pogacar has been ruled out of the Paris 2024 Olympics, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Pogacar, who won his third Tour on Sunday, was not selected because of fatigue, the Slovenian Olympic Committee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar was due to take part in the road race on August 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately Tadej Pogacar has cancelled his participation because of a state of extreme fatigue," Slovenian Olympic cycling coach Uros Murn said in a statement.

  Pogacar won a third Tour de France title in Nice on Sunday. Victory also gave him the first Giro d'Italia-Tour de France double since Marco Pantani in 1998. (Reuters/AFP)

 A gunman entered a nursing home in northwestern Croatia on Monday shooting dead five people, including his mother, and injuring six others, a government minister said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One of the wounded later died in hospital taking the death toll to six, while four remain in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the victims was a nursing home employee, according to Marin Piletic, minister for labour, pension, family and social policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the information we have the mother of the killer had been in the nursing home for 10 years," Piletic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have given no motive for the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Croatian media reported that the gunman, born in 1973, is a war veteran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are shocked," Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told reporters in Split.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is really a monstrous act of the murder of a group of people, of the mother and other very old people who happened to be there.... We condemn this crime."

 US Vice President Kamala Harris lauded President Joe Biden for his service to the country in her first public appearance on Monday since he abruptly abandoned his re-election bid and endorsed her as his successor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Joe Biden's legacy over the last three years is unmatched in modern history," Harris said at a White House event to honour college athletes. "Every day, our president, Joe Biden, fights for the American people and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris did not specifically refer to her new status as the leading Democratic candidate for president, after Biden stepped aside on Sunday under growing pressure from fellow Democrats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Campaign officials and allies have already made hundreds of calls on Harris' behalf, urging delegates to next month's Democratic Party convention to join in nominating her for president in the November 5 election against Republican Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's departure was the latest shock to a White House race that included the near-assassination of former President Trump by a gunman during a campaign stop and the nomination of Trump's fellow hardliner, US Senator J.D. Vance, as his running mate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harris said in a post on X that she would visit what had been the Biden campaign headquarters in Delaware – now the Harris campaign headquarters – on Monday afternoon. She said Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, was feeling better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Virtually all of the prominent Democrats who had been seen as potential challengers to Harris have lined up behind her, including Governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kimberly Cheatle gives evidence in Congress. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762714_1_20240722233833.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle admitted to Congress on Monday that she and her agency failed when a would-be assassin wounded Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We failed," Cheatle, who faces Republican calls for her removal, said in testimony before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee. "The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on July 13th is the most significant operational failure at the Secret Service in decades," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the face of Republican claims that the Secret Service denied resources to protect Trump, she said security for the former president had grown ahead of the shooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of security provided for the former president increased well before the campaign and has been steadily increasing as threats evolve," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the Secret Service provided the security sought by the Trump campaign for the rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I can tell you is that for the event on July 13, the details that were requested, the assets that were requested for that day, were given," Cheatle said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She declined to answer specific questions about the day's security plan from Republicans and Democrats, saying the matter was being investigated internally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monday's hearing marked the first round of congressional oversight of the attempted assassination. On Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray will appear before the House Judiciary Committee. And House Speaker Mike Johnson is also due to unveil a bipartisan task force to serve as a nexus point for House investigations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheatle has resisted calls for her resignation from top Republicans including Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican House Oversight Committee James Comer echoed those calls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is my firm belief, Director Cheatle, that you should resign," the Kentucky Republican told her. "The Secret Service has thousands of employees and a significant budget. But it has now become the face of incompetence." (Reuters)
