<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secret Service said former president Donald Trump was "safe" after he was rushed off stage when gunshots were fired at a campaign rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the bangs rang out, 78-year-old Trump grimaced and clutched a hand to his right ear, with blood soon visible across his face.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secret Service agents swarmed onto the podium, surrounded the Republican candidate and escorted him roughly off the stage, as Trump raised a fist to the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspected shooter was confirmed dead, along with one bystander, US media reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The former president is safe," the Secret Service said in a post on X, and his campaign said he was "fine" and being checked at a medical facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility," said spokesman Steven Cheung in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Joe Biden, who is set to face Trump in a bitter replay of their 2020 clash, said there was "no place for this kind of violence in America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm grateful to hear that he's safe and doing well," Biden said in a statement, adding: "I'm praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old, staying at his house in Rehoboth, Delaware, gave a televised statement repeating his message, saying "we cannot be like this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The shooting took place shortly after Trump took the stage at his final campaign rally before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. (AFP)

    UK's Labour party to focus on 'turbo charging growth'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The King's Speech on Wednesday will outline the plans of Keir Starmer and the Labour Party to revitalise Britain's economy. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761499_1_20240714060120.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The UK's incoming Labour government will focus on measures to "turbo charge growth" when it unveils its legislative plans at next week's King's Speech, prime minister Keir Starmer said in comments released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "From energy, to planning, to unbreakable fiscal rules, my government is serious about delivering the stability that is going to turbo charge growth that will create wealth in every corner of the UK," said Starmer, whose party won a huge landslide earlier this month, ending 14 years of Conservative rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our work is urgent. There is no time to waste. We are hitting the ground running by bringing forward the laws we will need to rebuild our country for the long-term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The task of national renewal will not be easy... but the legislation set out at the King's Speech will build on the momentum of our first days in office and make a difference to the lives of working people," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charles III will deliver the King's Speech on Wednesday, as parliament formally reopens after the July 4 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite its name, the address is not written by the monarch but by the government which uses it to detail the laws it proposes to make over the coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it was working on more than 35 bills "to deliver an ambitious parliamentary session that will be built on a bedrock of economic security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include measures to enforce public spending rules and others to prevent a repeat of the utility bill price hikes that triggered the UK's recent cost-of-living crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislation will also flesh out announcements already made this week, such as the launching of a fund to draw investment into the UK and of a body tasked with boosting clean power by 2030, as well as the opening of recruitment for a new border security command. (AFP)

    Sanders voices support for Biden's candidacy

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win" says independent Senator Bernie Sanders. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761497_1_20240714054229.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senator Bernie Sanders, a prominent figure of the US political left, on Saturday threw his support behind Joe Biden's White House campaign, dismissing calls for the president to withdraw from the race over health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Enough! Mr Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate," independent senator Sanders wrote in a New York Times column, adding that "it's time for Democrats to stop the bickering and nit-picking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders's column comes amid steadily growing calls from Democratic officials and donors for the 81-year-old Biden to step aside following a disastrous performance in his June 27 debate with former president Donald Trump. So far, some 20 members of Congress have called for him to leave the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most polls taken since the debate show Trump with a national lead over Biden, though within the margin of error. They also show some key battleground states, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, shifting in the Republican's favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a majority of Americans – including Democrats – believe Biden is too old to serve again, according to a recent poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president did not help his own cause when, at a summit in Washington earlier this week, he mistakenly introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as his foe Vladimir Putin, before quickly correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden, however, insisted during an appearance on Friday that he is, and will remain, his party's flagbearer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am running and we're going to win," he told an enthusiastic audience in Detroit, amid chants of "Don't you quit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His running mate and Vice President Kamala Harris doubled down her support for Biden, calling him a "fighter" at a campaign event on Saturday in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where Trump is also holding a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, we will continue to fight. We will continue to organise. And in November, we will win," said Harris, who some pundits have speculated could lead the Democratic ticket if Biden stepped aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seeking to allay concerns, Biden spoke with members of the Democratic Party's left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus in a virtual meeting on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will also sit for interviews next week with NBC News and Black Entertainment Television (BET).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders, who at 82 is himself seeking reelection to the Senate in November, did acknowledge the signs of the president's aging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But given Biden's achievements – and the record of Trump, "who has 34 felony convictions and... has told thousands of documented lies" – the senator brushed Biden's shortcomings aside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, I know," he wrote. "Mr Biden is old, is prone to gaffes, walks stiffly and had a disastrous debate with Mr Trump. But this I also know: A presidential election is not an entertainment contest. It does not begin or end with a 90-minute debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He blamed the eruption of anti-Biden rhetoric partly on "the corporate media (which) has obsessively focused on the June presidential debate and the cognitive capabilities of a man who has, perhaps, the most difficult and stressful job in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sanders also blamed those Democrats who he said had "joined that circular firing squad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He challenged the president to do more – to "propose and fight for a bold agenda" that would help lift working families "who have been left behind for far too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden, he concluded, was "a good and decent Democratic president with a record of real accomplishment," including helping rebuild the US economy and shoring up the country's crumbling infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the sake of our kids and future generations, he must win." (AFP)

    Baldwin thanks supporters after early end to trial

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alec Baldwin made his first public comments to thank his supporters on Saturday after the stunning early end to his involuntary manslaughter trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "There are too many people who have supported me to thank just now," Baldwin said in a brief Instagram post that accompanied a photo of him sitting in a Santa Fe, New Mexico, courtroom. “To all of you, you will never know how much I appreciate your kindness toward my family.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The actor wept a day earlier when Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case three days into the trial and said he could not be criminally charged again in the killing of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Neither he nor his lawyers spoke to reporters as he left the courthouse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evidence that sank the case was ammunition that was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammunition unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers alleged they “buried” it and filed a motion to dismiss the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge said the withholding of the evidence tainted the “fundamental fairness” of the trial of the 66-year-old Baldwin, who could have gotten 18 months in prison if he were convicted. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt=""What have they done? They're children, children," this woman cries.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel had declared Al-Mawasi a "safe zone" as it pushed into Rafah near the Egyptian border, but on Saturday Palestinians raced to collect dozens of casualties from the military's latest strike.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sirens wailed and women screamed as children were pulled bloody and unmoving from the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What have they done? they're children, children," one woman cried. "Seven-year-old and 12-year-old children."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Mawasi, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people had sought refuge, was left a chaos-strewn wasteland by one of the deadliest Israeli strikes since the start of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hamas-run territory's health ministry said at least 90 people were killed, half of them women and children. It said another 300 people were wounded in the "massacre".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an attack in the Khan Younis area had targeted Hamas military strategist Mohammed Deif and Rafa Salama, a brigade commander, but there was "no certainty that the two were eliminated."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Located near the city of Khan Younis, Al-Mawasi was designated a humanitarian area after Israel in May ordered civilians to evacuate from other parts of the Gaza Strip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been warning for months that there is no safe place for anyone in Gaza amid Israel's military bombardment," said UK-based Medical Aid for Palestinians, which operates health sites in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said hundreds of thousands of displaced people were sheltering in the "safe zone," which had been targeted before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Black smoke billowed behind a wide, ash-strewn street in Al-Mawasi where bodies lay in pools of blood, some covered by sheets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Men struggling to carry the wounded wove through those beyond help to reach ambulances waiting with open doors. Others were piled onto donkey-pulled carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are people who have lost limbs everywhere. It's a scene the mind cannot even imagine," Mahmoud Chahine said near a market struck in the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the Nasser Hospital reportedly saying it was at full capacity, ambulances kept arriving, carting in the wounded on orange stretchers, including a man with a towel tied around his leg as a makeshift tourniquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman outside the hospital could be heard pleading: "Please enough, enough for God's sake."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said the attack against Deif "struck an open area" that "was not a tent complex but an operational compound."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our information, only Hamas terrorists were present and there were no civilians," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Netanyahu's office, he had discussed the strike with security and military officials as part of his goal "to eliminate senior Hamas officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas called the claim that Deif had been targeted "false allegations" intended "to cover up the magnitude of the horrific massacre" in Al-Mawasi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's civil defence agency said heavy fire was preventing its teams from reaching the "many bodies" scattered in the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmoud Abu Akar, an eyewitness, described repeated missiles raining down on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time people tried to get close to rescue others, they would strike," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There was no warning at all, it happened all of a sudden."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since telling people to relocate to Al-Mawasi in May, the Israeli military has been accused of repeatedly striking the area in deadly attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June the International Committee of the Red Cross said 22 people were killed by shelling that damaged its office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Returning from the Nasser Hospital on Saturday, Louise Wateridge, from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said children had suffered life-changing injuries and people were angry there was no reprieve from the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no safety here, no matter where people go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's strike came on the 281st day of the war that was unleashed by Hamas's October 7 attacks on Israel, which resulted in 1,195 deaths, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military reprisal has killed at least 38,443 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data from Gaza's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his government had "no certainty" that Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif was killed in a strike that officials in Hamas-run Gaza said killed dozens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Israel attacked Gaza today in an attempt to eliminate Mohammed Deif and his deputy, Rafa Salama," Netanyahu told a press conference hours after the attack on Al-Mawasi, a designated safe zone in Gaza's south sheltering displaced Palestinians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no certainty that the two were eliminated," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 71 people were killed and nearly 300 wounded in the strike on Al-Mawasi, near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had designated the area a safe zone and told civilians in other areas in Gaza to go there for safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu described Deif, head of the Hamas military wing, as "the planner and leader" of the October 7 attack that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring back all hostages from Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The elimination of the heads of Hamas advances the achievement of all our objectives," said the right-wing premier who faces mounting opposition to the conduct of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In recent weeks, we have identified clear cracks within Hamas," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's operation also contributes to this, regardless of what its outcomes will be." (AFP)

    Last-gasp drop goal lifts Ireland over Springboks

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland toppled world champions South Africa 25-24 with a drop goal by Ciaran Frawley in the last second of a ferocious body-smashing contest at Kings Park on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Irish rebounded from losing 27-20 last weekend in Pretoria by notching only their second ever win over the Springboks in South Africa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It didn't look like it would happen after the Springboks came back from 16-6 down at halftime, finding another gear and forcing errors that Handre Pollard used to kick eight penalties from eight attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after falling behind 24-19 with 15 minutes to go, Ireland found the energy to pin South Africa in their 22. They waived off a penalty kick to go for a try and squandered a tapped penalty. But, out of nowhere, replacement flyhalf Frawley lined up a 42-metre drop goal in the 70th minute to keep them in touch at 25-22 behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Irish, playing their 15th and last test of a super-long Rugby World Cup season, rallied yet again and, as the match clock ticked into the red, Frawley let fly with another drop goal from the same length as the first and won a gripping match and squared a classic series. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lavish wedding celebrations for the son of Asia's richest man resumed on Saturday with a star-studded guest list including Hollywood celebrities, global business leaders and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Billionaire tycoon Mukesh Ambani's youngest son Anant and his fiancee Radhika Merchant, both 29, are tying the knot over the weekend in Mumbai following months of pre-marriage parties that have set a new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's itinerary included a blessing ceremony during which the world's rich and famous greeted the couple at the wedding venue, a 16,000-capacity convention centre owned by the Ambani family's conglomerate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage from inside shared by local broadcasters showed Modi, whose policies have been warmly supported by the groom's father over his decade in power, was among the guests to pay their respects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event followed a formal ceremony and party on Friday attended by the likes of socialite Kim Kardashian, actor John Cena, and former British premiers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee were among the hundreds of other famous figures present.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Best wishes to the new couple and double happiness!" Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong posted on social media platform X along with footage of the couple from inside the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This weekend's celebrations end on Sunday with a reception party, and cap months of extravagant pre-wedding festivities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier events this year included a party at the Ambanis' ancestral home where a purpose-built Hindu temple was unveiled, and private performances by R&B star Rihanna and Canada's Justin Bieber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guests at that gala included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former US president Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, along with a who's who of India's sporting and entertainment worlds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, the couple embarked on a four-day Mediterranean cruise along with 1,200 guests, with singer Katy Perry performing at a masquerade ball at a French chateau in Cannes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mumbai this year overtook Beijing to become the Asian city with the most billionaires, according to a Chinese research institute survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But despite India being the world's fastest growing economy, the gap between rich and poor remains vast. More than half of the country's 1.4 billion people live on less than four dollars per day, according to World Bank figures from 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the wedding and its VIP attendees have been the subject of relentless and laudatory media coverage in India, the reaction among the public has been mixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They must have spent over US$60 million, while I will struggle to earn just US$400 this month," said Mumbai general store worker Jitesh Ingle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But this is our life. What can we do? We can only watch their celebrations on YouTube."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anant's father Mukesh is chairman of Reliance Industries, a family-founded conglomerate that has grown into India's biggest company by market cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patriarch is the world's 11th richest person with a fortune of more than US$123 billion, according to Forbes, and is no stranger to making a statement when it comes to family marriages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He held the most expensive wedding in India to date for his daughter in 2018, which reportedly cost US$100 million and saw US singer Beyonce perform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The family's lucrative interests include retail partnerships with Armani and other luxury brands, more than 40 percent of India's mobile phone market and an Indian Premier League cricket team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His 27-floor family home Antilia is one of Mumbai's most prominent landmarks, reportedly costing more than US$1 billion to build and with a permanent staff of 600 servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Merchant is the daughter of well-known pharmaceutical moguls. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wales' Rio Dyer dives in to score a try in the corner and set up a tense finale. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761485_1_20240714011612.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A resurgent Wallabies earned their first back-to-back Test wins since 2021 on Saturday with a hard-fought 36-28 victory over Wales, who extended their horror run to nine straight defeats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Filipo Daugunu scored twice with Jake Gordon and Allan Alaalatoa also crossing on a wet and cold Melbourne night to back up their 25-16 triumph in Sydney a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took a 23-14 lead into the break and withstood intense second-half pressure and a series of handling errors to seal the series 2-0 and give new coach Joe Schmidt the second win of his tenure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was tough, bit of relief at the end there," said Wallabies skipper James Slipper.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was scrappy from us for sure, it wasn't our best game, but we got the result. There's plenty to work on though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are gritty, they hang in there, they played our kicking game really well tonight," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defeat piled more pain on Warren Gatland's team which is now one loss away from equalling Wales' all-time record of 10 consecutive defeats, which came in 2002 and 2003 under another New Zealander, Steve Hansen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have slumped to 11th in the world rankings, below Fiji and Italy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite clawing back from 17-0 down after 25 minutes, they paid the price for conceding too many penalties and again lost the breakdown battle, sorely missing injured workhorse No 8 Aaron Wainwright.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We never gave up, we had a never-say-die attitude," said Wales captain Dewi Lake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But obviously we are a young team and we don't have enough experience really at Test level. What matters is results and we are not giving ourselves those at the moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taine Plumtree assumed Wainwright's role in the back row with James Botham, grandson of England cricket great Ian Botham, starting at blindside flanker and Tommy Reffell at openside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they were immediately exposed as Australia scored inside seven minutes with a move that started from near their own try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under pressure, wing Andrew Kellaway sidestepped the Welsh defence then collected his own chip before offloading to a charging Fraser McReight who powered up the field and found Daugunu to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the rain hammering down, they kept the pressure on with Lolesio making it 10-0 off the tee with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu made a try-saving tackle on Botham as Wales warmed to the task, but it was Australia who scored once more against the run of play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scrum-half Gordon sent up a box kick and a handling error from fullback Cam Winnett allowed him to collect it and weave past two defenders to the try line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undeterred, a well-worked rolling maul from the lineout saw Lake muscle over to get Wales on the board after half-an-hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With Australia's Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in the sin-bin he repeated the feat soon afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both tries were converted to get Wales back in the game at 20-14 and an early converted try to veteran winger Liam Williams in the second-half put the Wallabies on notice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the hosts proved they too could work a rolling maul, with Alaalatoa powering over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daugunu got his second after a schoolboy error from Williams, who tried to keep the ball in play from a Wallabies kick, only to palm it perfectly to a charging Daugunu who surged to the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It gave Australia a 33-21 lead, but they went to sleep and Wales winger Rio Dyer smashed over in the corner to set up a tense finale. (AFP)

    Imran Khan's illegal marriage conviction overturned

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, however, have now been arrested on a new graft charge. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761484_1_20240714010400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Pakistan court overturned ex-prime minister Imran Khan's conviction on illegal marriage charges on Saturday, though he remains jailed after fresh charges were swiftly brought against him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Khan was slapped with a trio of convictions in the days before February elections – cases he says were orchestrated to prevent his return to power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those cases have now all been at least partially rolled back on appeal, with a treason conviction carrying a decade jail term overturned in April, and a 14-year graft sentence suspended in June, though the conviction still stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi had also been sentenced to seven years for allegedly marrying too soon after her divorce, in a breach of Islamic law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an Islamabad judge announced on Saturday that the couple's appeals were accepted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan remains locked up, though, with his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party saying a court in eastern Lahore had approved his arrest over three cases alleging he incited riots in May 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spokesman Ahmed Janjua said it was "yet another gimmick to keep the illegal imprisonment prolonged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Saturday, PTI said Khan and Bibi had also been arrested on a separate graft case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month a UN panel of experts found Khan's detention "had no legal basis and appears to have been intended to disqualify him from running for political office."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "prosecution was not grounded in law and was reportedly instrumentalised for a political purpose," it said, calling for his immediate release after nearly a year in jail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan served as prime minister from 2018 to 2022, when he was ousted after falling out with the military establishment, which wields huge influence over civilian politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In opposition he waged a campaign of defiance against the generals, who directly ruled Pakistan for decades of its history, even accusing them of being behind an assassination attempt that wounded him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the former cricket star's comeback was hobbled by scores of legal cases, which analysts say were likely brought at the behest of the military establishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan was first briefly arrested in May 2023, sparking nationwide unrest from PTI supporters, some of which targeted military facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government and military cited the attacks as justification for a sweeping crackdown on PTI, which saw its senior leadership decimated by arrests and defections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PTI candidates were forced to stand as independents in the February 8 elections, which had been repeatedly delayed amid political chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan's arrest and conviction for graft in August 2023 meant he was barred from standing for office himself, confined to a cell in Adiala Jail south of Islamabad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the setbacks, candidates loyal to PTI secured more seats than any other party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nonetheless they were blocked from power by a broad coalition of military-backed rival parties, amid widespread allegations of vote-tampering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gallup Pakistan analyst Bilal Gilani said the rolling back of the cases against Khan now could suggest the establishment was softening its stance in the wake of the election – or that the courts were defying their attempts to keep him confined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an important judgement, because essentially now there are a limited number of cases left," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Immediate release is quite impossible, but... the chances of release are getting clearer by the day," he added. (AFP)

 Tadej Pogacar extended his overall lead on the Tour de France when he won stage 14 in the Pyrenees on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His arch rival Jonas Vingegaard came second at 39sec while Remco Evenepoel was third at 1min 10sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of another monster run in the Pyrenees on Sunday, Pogacar extended his lead to 1min 57sec over Vingegaard as Evenepoel dropped to third at 2min 22sec.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pogacar's team UAE waited until the third and final climb of the day before sending Adam Yates on an attack that the Slovenian would soon join.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Pogacar unleashed a ferocious acceleration, his two podium rivals followed, but were either unwilling or unable to match the pace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the final section of a climb, packed on either side by raucous fans, 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar extended his lead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barbora Krejcikova won Wimbledon for her second Grand Slam title with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-4 victory over Jasmine Paolini in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is a 28-year-old from the Czech Republic who adds this trophy to her championship at the French Open in 2021 .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was unseeded in Paris back then and was only the 31st of 32 seeds at the All England Club after illness and a back injury this season limited her to a 7-9 record entering this tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova is the eighth woman to leave Wimbledon as the champion in the past eight editions of the event. Last year's champion is also from the Czech Republic: unseeded Marketa Vondrousova, who lost in the first round last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seventh-seeded Paolini was the runner-up at the French Open last month and is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to get to the finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same season. (AP)

    Kremlin warns US missiles could make Europe a target

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggests that deploying US missiles in Europe will automatically make European capitals Russian targets. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761478_1_20240713225234.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kremlin on Saturday warned the deployment of US missiles in Germany could make European capitals targets for Russian missiles in a repeat of Cold War-style confrontation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke of a "paradox" in which "Europe is a target for our missiles, our country is a target for US missiles in Europe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enough capacity to contain these missiles but the potential victims are the capitals of these countries," he said, speaking to Russian state television channel Russia 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Peskov also hinted that such a confrontation could undermine Europe as a whole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Europe is not living its best moment. In a different configuration, a repeat of history is inevitable," he said when the channel's anchor Pavel Zarubin pointed out that the Cold War had ended with the Soviet Union's collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House announced on Wednesday during a Nato summit that it would periodically station long-range weapons including Tomahawk cruise missiles in Germany from 2026 as a deterrent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exercising these advanced capabilities will demonstrate the United States' commitment to Nato and its contributions to European integrated deterrence," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin criticised the move, accusing Washington of taking a step towards a new Cold War and of directly participating in the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov held a telephone call with his US counterpart Lloyd Austin where they discussed lowering the risk of "possible escalation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato countries – spearheaded by the United States – have bolstered their defences in Europe following the start of Russia's military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police on Saturday arrested a man after two suitcases believed to contain the remains of two men were dumped on a famous bridge.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suitcases were discovered on Wednesday after police got a report of a man behaving suspiciously on the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, southwest England.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Detectives have arrested a man in connection with an investigation into the discovery of human remains on Clifton Suspension Bridge," said the Metropolitan Police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old suspect was detained in Bristol and will be taken to London for questioning later on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Metropolitan Police said the victims have not been formally identified, but both are believed to be men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The London-based force took over the investigation after evidence suggested that the wanted man had travelled to Bristol from the UK capital earlier on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Clifton Suspension Bridge, designed by the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is one of the oldest surviving suspension bridges in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Opened in 1864, the bridge over the Avon Gorge is one of Bristol's top tourist attractions and a symbol of the city. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund has agreed to loan Pakistan US$7 billion to bolster its faltering economy, with Islamabad pledging on Saturday it would be the last time it relied on relief from the Washington-based lender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The South Asian nation agreed to the deal – its 24th IMF payout since 1958 – in exchange for unpopular reforms, including widening its chronically low tax base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan last year came to the brink of default as the economy shrivelled amid political chaos following catastrophic 2022 monsoon floods and decades of mismanagement, as well as a global economic downturn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was saved by last-minute loans from friendly countries, as well as an IMF rescue package, but its finances remain in dire straits, with high inflation and staggering public debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This programme should be considered the last programme," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told ministers and revenue officials in Islamabad. "We should tax those who are not being taxed."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad wrangled for months with IMF officials to unlock the new loan announced on Friday, which will be paid out over three years subject to approval by the organisation's Executive Board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came on condition of far-reaching reforms including hiking household bills to remedy a permanently crisis-stricken energy sector and uplifting pitiful tax takings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a nation of over 240 million people and where most jobs are in the informal sector, only 5.2 million filed income tax returns in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the 2024-25 fiscal year that started at the beginning of July, the government aims to raise nearly US$46 billion in taxes, a 40 percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More unusual methods have seen the tax authority block 210,000 SIM cards of mobile users who have not filed tax returns in a bid to widen the revenue bracket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the deal "revenue collections will be supported by simpler and fairer direct and indirect taxation including by bringing net income from the retail, export, and agriculture sectors properly into the tax system", IMF Pakistan Mission Chief Nathan Porter said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Islamabad also aims to reduce its fiscal deficit by 1.5 percent to 5.9 percent in the coming year, heeding another key IMF demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF said the loan and its conditions should allow Pakistan to "cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Pakistan's public debt remains huge at US$242 billion, and servicing it will still swallow up half of the government's income in 2024, according to the IMF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have criticised Islamabad's measures as surface-level reforms aimed at courting the IMF without addressing underlying problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to not see old patterns in this new IMF deal," said Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The IMF has issued a loan similar in size and conditions as the one agreed to five years ago, and five years before that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will authorities seize the opportunity thus created to embark on fundamental reforms to how the country is run?" he asked. "You would be well-advised not to hold your breath."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Sharif came to power in February elections marred by allegations of rigging, with ex-PM Imran Khan jailed and barred from running.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The diet of strict economic measures introduced by his shaky coalition government is likely to undermine their popularity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have already been scattered protests over tax and bill hikes introduced in last month's budget – prepared with IMF oversight – and more demonstrations are scheduled for the coming weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While around 40 percent of the population already lives below the poverty line, the World Bank said in April it feared that 10 million additional Pakistanis would fall below this threshold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistan's last US$3 billion loan from the IMF in 2023 proved a lifeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it also came on the condition of unpopular austerity measures, including an end to subsidies cushioning consumer costs. (AFP)

    Nepal recovers first body from buses swept into river

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nepali rescue teams on Saturday recovered the first body from around 50 people missing after monsoon rains triggered a landslide that swept two buses off a highway and into a river.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force of Friday's landslide in central Chitwan district pushed the vehicles over concrete crash barriers and down a steep embankment, at least 30 metres from the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One body has been found about 55 kilometres from the accident site," said police spokesman Kumar Neupane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  District official Khimananda Bhusal said that roughly 50 people remained unaccounted for, revising down the number of missing from the 63 reported by authorities on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is hard to confirm the total number because we don't know if the buses stopped to add or remove passengers along the way," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of rescuers spent hours struggling to comb the raging Trishuli river with rafts, sensor equipment and dive teams to find any trace of the passengers or the vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teams on Saturday also moved downstream in hope of locating the missing passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fierce currents made worse by this week's torrential downpours have hampered their efforts so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chitwan district chief Indra Dev Yadav said that all authorities in the area have been instructed to stay on alert for any signs of the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The river is narrow here and very deep," he said. "The water level is high, its speed is high and its turbidity is also high."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accident happened before dawn on Friday along the Narayanghat-Mugling highway, around 100 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was heading from the capital to Gaur in Rautahat district in southern Nepal, and the other was en route to Kathmandu from southern Birgunj.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver was killed in a separate accident on the same road after a boulder hit his bus. He died as he was being treated at a hospital. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New Zealand hung on to beat England after two tries from Mark Tele'a. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761467_1_20240713204131.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wing Mark Tele'a scored two tries on Saturday as New Zealand squeezed past England 24-17 to win a hard-fought second Test in Auckland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tele'a touched down either side of half-time as the All Blacks took the series 2-0 and extended their 30-year unbeaten record at Eden Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Just like in the 16-15 first Test win at Dunedin, New Zealand had to wrestle back the lead in the second half from a spirited England side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hugely proud of the boys to hold on and win the arm wrestle and finish off a good performance," said New Zealand captain Scott Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Test matches certainly challenge your character and we had to dig deep there, right till the last minute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fly-half Marcus Smith led the visitors to a 14-13 advantage at half-time after his pin-point cross-field kicks created tries for wing Tommy Freeman and Immanuel Feyi-Waboso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After a breathless opening spell, the All Blacks took the lead when Tele'a caught the England defence napping from a ruck to dart over for a try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All Blacks fly-half Damian McKenzie landed the conversion, but England immediately hit back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Smith kicked wide into the arms of Feyi-Waboso, who stepped inside the defence for a converted try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand should have had a second try when Tele'a broke away, but Smith intercepted the final pass to Stephen Perofeta on the England tryline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie landed a penalty, but Smith quickly took the kick-off to pin the All Blacks deep in their own half, where they stayed for the next 15 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie stroked over another penalty, but England led at half-time after Freeman outleapt Tele'a to haul in Smith's kick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England number 10 successfully converted from the touchline .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England started the second-half camped in the All Blacks half and Smith extended the lead to 17-13 with a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With half an hour left, scrum-half Cortez Ratima came on to make his All Blacks debut when he replaced the dazed Finlay Christie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game's momentum swung New Zealand's way when the All Blacks brought on Beauden Barrett.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The twice world player of the year showed his class by restoring the lead for New Zealand when he scythed through a gap to put Tele'a over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  McKenzie missed the conversion, but landed two penalties to pull New Zealand out of England's reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visitors fought until the end with England captain Jamie George denied near the New Zealand line from scoring a potential match-levelling try.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think we're a significantly better team than we when we started," said England captain George.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's hugely exciting times ahead for this English team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll welcome them to Twickenham in November, we'll look forward to that." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Gaza said an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in the south of the Palestinian territory killed at least 71 people on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 280 others were injured in the strike on Al-Mawasi camp, the ministry said, condemning a "brutal massacre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It came as the Israeli military pursued attacks in central Gaza with artillery fire and drone strikes, while Palestinian medics said one bombing killed a father and his three daughters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Palestine Red Crescent medics said the strike on a home in Deir al-Balah city killed Rital al-Raey, five, Mai, eight, Leila, nine and their 40-year-old father Mohammed al-Raey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their bodies were taken to the city's Al-Aqsa hospital, the medical workers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Defence agency in Hamas-run Gaza said on Friday that Israeli forces had withdrawn from Tal al-Hawa and other districts, after days of fighting. It said at least 60 bodies had been found in Tal al-Hawa and a neighbouring area after the withdrawal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the agency said 60 bodies had been found in nearby Shujaiya after Israel ended an operation there. Israel's military said it had killed 150 militants in Shujaiya during a two-week operation against Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday the army said operations were continuing in Gaza City as well as "targeted, intelligence-based" missions in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of Doraemon flocked to Tsim Sha Tsui on Saturday for an exhibition, in its returns to the city after 12 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The free-entry zone at the Avenue of Stars features the world's tallest 12-metre inflatable Doraemon sculpture as well as 34 different versions of Doraemon in 1:1 life size.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some fans chose to buy a ticket to access the indoor exhibition at K11 MUSEA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who came from Shenzhen, said he made a day trip to Hong Kong just for the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very excited and I'm looking forward to it. I've waited for this moment for over two months. I may come again next week for the drone show," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Doraemon fan said his family had moved to the United States, but they are back in town and felt lucky to catch the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are back in Hong Kong for the summer vacation. Tickets went on sale 2 months ago and we bought them immediately. We spent about HK$2,000 on souvenirs. We bought clothes, a popcorn bucket and a soft toy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition runs from Saturday to August 11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers said tickets for the indoor exhibition are sold out.

    Turkey puts its best foot forward to Chinese investors

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey plans to draw on its geographical position and an EU customs deal to entice Chinese investors keen to access European markets tariff-free, as it recently just did with carmaker BYD.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant signed a billion-dollar deal with Ankara on Monday to open a plant in western Turkey, promising to create 5,000 jobs, a move that will help it avoid new EU tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, is in talks with other Chinese companies, Turkey's Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kacir said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to transform Turkey into a production centre for the next generation of vehicles," Kacir told private broadcaster Haberturk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister emphasised his country's selling points, including being part of the EU's customs union and having trade agreements with 28 countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese producers want rapid access to international markets," he said. "Investing in Turkey offers them that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ankara struck a customs deal with the EU in 1995 that enables the free flow between them of a number of goods, notably cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey became one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry starting in the 1970s, when major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there -- with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new regulations on investment incentives, BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey originally imposed on electric vehicle import - Manufacturers investing in the country will be exempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish manufacturer TOGG and Chinese firm Farasis have also partnered up to produce EV batteries in Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish officials have held numerous meetings with Chinese industrialists in the last year, according to the industry ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's foreign affairs minister Hakan Fidan visited China in June to seal a new bilateral deal, calling the countries "drivers of Asian wealth." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Legal amendments to directly penalise firms involved in data breaches are being considered, privacy commissioner Ada Chung said on Saturday, which would change the current practice of issuing an enforcement notice with a non-compliance subject to a fine or imprisonment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Chung said there is a need to empower the watchdog to penalise firms breaching the privacy ordinance to increase deterrence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are to introduce a mechanism for administrative fines, we have to look at a series of factors and then decide on the penalty amount. For example, the number of people that were affected by the data breach, because affecting 10 people is completely different from affecting 100,000 people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also we have to look at the sensitivity of the data, whether it involves medical records, as well as how the data was leaked, whether it's the fault of the company or its staff, or simply an individual case.“
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said the privacy watchdog received 97 data leak reports in the first half of the year, with seventy percent of them coming from private firms and public bodies accounting for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of data breaches in the second quarter rose by 70 percent, she added.

    Travel alerts on HK not grounded in facts: Eric Chan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan has hit out at certain countries and regions deciding to issue travel alerts on Hong Kong, saying the warnings are simply not grounded in facts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Taiwan recently upgraded the warning to its second highest after the United States renewed the SAR's emergency status, which were widely condemned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The senior official told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that the moves were politically motivated and the SAR must rebut the accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have one mega event almost every two days on average. We also have a lot of international events. The aim is to have overseas tourists come to Hong Kong and see if it's as others say it is, that police are arresting people arbitrarily on the streets after the introduction of the national security law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's best for people to come and see for themselves, and they will see that the situation isn't what they think it is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary also said the administration will promote patriotic education through a "soft approach", and that people must first understand the nation before forming an identity and eventually loving and safeguarding the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that there will be activities across all 18 districts on October 1, combining National Day celebrations and patriotic education.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sports minister has stressed that no system should hinder an athlete's opportunity to compete or receive training, following calls for the swimming governing body to revise its rules of competition qualifications.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong China Swimming Association came under scrutiny after a nine-year-old was reportedly barred from competing at a swimming competition due to the ranking of his club, despite meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kevin Yeung, the secretary for culture, sports and tourism, on Saturday said the government awaits developments of the situation, after the association said it has ways to allow the concerned athlete to compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he told a Commercial Radio programme that different sports governing bodies should review their systems, from time to time and strengthen their governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to promote the sport, as well as its development, while giving talented athletes the chance to receive professional training or compete, or even represent Hong Kong in competitions. This is a basic principle that I believe everyone agrees with, so no system should become a factor that hinders this goal," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrival of the two giant pandas gifted by the central government, the minister said the pair should be able arrive in Hong Kong by National Day, on October 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the administration would discuss whether to give the pair new names when they arrive in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government is considering promoting "giant panda economy" to boost tourism.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The administration is aiming to have all government bureaus and departments adopt Hong Kong's own version of ChatGPT within this year, according to the technology chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Dong, the secretary for innovation, technology and industry, also said on Saturday that his bureau has been trialling the AI-powered document assistance system, which was developed by government-founded platform InnoHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The concept of the trial is that when we are using the system, problems will arise, and then we give feedback to improve it. At the same time, the more we use and train it, the better the model will be," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now, the trial has been smooth, and the system will soon be expanded to other bureaus for use. The goal is simple – to have the entire government using the system this year. And the system will eventually be open to the whole society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the government has deliberated introducing the city's data security law, but noted that the process is rather complicated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Legislation is definitely within our scope of consideration, but it cannot be done overnight," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that data security law will be introduced once the data industry has matured.

    AI robot helps patients with cognitive impairment

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The AI-powered robot at Eastern Hospital can communicate with patients in Cantonese. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761414_1_20240713081443.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Eastern Hospital is testing an AI-powered robot to help training patients with mild cognitive impairment, with therapists describing that as "a helpful assistant".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital’s occupational therapists have compiled a database of about 400 questions, covering key cognitive domains and input it into the robot, which is able to communicate with people in Cantonese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During training sessions, the robot randomly posts questions from the database. Patients can answer by talking to the robot, and they must get each of the questions right before moving on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The robot will provide hints if patients struggle with a question repeatedly and adjust the difficulty level for subsequent questions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will be a very good encouragement for the patients to continue their cognitive training. Because many of the patients, if they face several failures, they may just idle the training sections away,” says senior occupational therapist Thomas Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And this situation is very common when we use the traditional one-way computer-aided training. For AI, it can eliminate these kinds of limitations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These robot-assisted sessions are typically about 20 minutes shorter than traditional face-to-face sessions, and patients who improve quickly can even do the sessions without a therapist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung stressed that while this helps free up some staff time, it doesn’t mean human therapists can be replaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can say this AI robot facilitates the patient's participation in training but I don't think AI robots will replace human therapists. For this AI robot it still has to depend on the input from the therapist in programming and provide different situations for this system to learn,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital currently deploys one AI-powered robot to work with a select group of geriatric and psychiatric patients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it’s working on expanding the AI database and upgrading the hardware to improve the robot’s conversation skills and response time before wider use.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their upward climb on Friday, shrugging off disappointing inflation data and a poor response to bank earnings amid expectations of easing US monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US wholesale inflation rose 0.2 percent in June, more than expected, according to Labour Department data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However Friday's data was not bad enough to overshadow Thursday's benign consumer price index report that boosted expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, analysts said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.6 percent at 40,000, just shy of a closing record set in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 also gained 0.6 percent to 5,615, along with the Nasdaq, which closed at 18,398. Both indices had dropped on Thursday, ending a multi-day stretch of records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yesterday's decline appears to be a one-off and it's not leading to more selling," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments, who considers the current dynamics a bull market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hardest hit large bank after earnings was Wells Fargo, which sank 6.0 percent as it reported lower profits due in part to a decline in net interest income.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase also fell more than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The air taxi startup Archer Aviation soared 10.4 percent after announcing a partnership with Southwest Airlines to provide aircraft in California. Southwest rose 2.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  AT&T shed 0.2 percent after disclosing a massive data breach in which hackers stole call and message data from virtually all of its customers for six months in 2022 – around 90 million people. (AFP)

    Biden hits campaign trail as calls to quit pile up

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At least President Zelensky, a former comedian, could see the funny side of Joe Biden's gaffe at the Nato summit. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761395_1_20240713021914.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail on Friday, pushing ahead with his reelection bid after a mixed performance at a major news conference failed to silence calls for him to quit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 81-year-old will give a speech bashing rival Donald Trump in Detroit in the rust-belt state of Michigan, a crucial battleground state that the Democrat must win in November's election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A defiant Biden insisted in a pivotal appearance at a Nato summit on Thursday that he would run again, and win – despite concerns about his age and health following a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a series of gaffes, including referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as "Vice President Trump," kept Biden's fitness for a second term under the microscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top Democrat in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, said he had met with Biden late on Thursday, as the number of members calling on the president to step aside rose to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jeffries said he and Biden "expressed the full breadth of insight, heartfelt perspectives and conclusions about the path forward" but did not give further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president has faced a steady drumbeat of Democrats calling for him to abandon his 2024 candidacy since the June 27 debate, during which Biden often lost his train of thought and appeared tired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Biden has obstinately dug in and insists that he can convince voters to back him despite most polls showing him trailing the criminally convicted, twice-impeached Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The campaign event in Detroit is his fourth trip this year to the state, part of the industrial "blue wall" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that were key to his 2020 win against his rival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's speech is expected to focus on "Project 2025", a blueprint by hardline conservatives for the first days of a Trump term that Democrats have pinned on the former president, despite the 78-year-old's denials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The press conference on Thursday appeared to buy Biden some time even if it was far from a knockout blow, with three more lawmakers urging him to quit just minutes after it finished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden said he was the "most qualified person to run for president," rejecting calls for him to step aside before the November 5 vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He acknowledged he had to "allay fears" in the Democratic party and should "pace myself a little more" after blaming jet lag and a cold for his stumbling debate performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden also fielded a series of foreign and domestic policy questions with detailed if meandering answers and relatively few slip-ups, though he did mix up Europe and Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were damaging moments on Thursday, with the Trump-Harris mixup and an earlier gaffe at the Nato summit in which he introduced Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The concerns over Biden are also affecting Democratic donors, with Hollywood star and high-profile supporter George Clooney calling on Biden to step aside on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of other key donors have told the largest Biden campaign fund that around US$90 million in pledged donations is on hold if he carries on running, the New York Times reported on Friday. (AFP)

    Djokovic, Alcaraz to clash again in Wimbledon final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="At 37, Novak Djokovic can become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he beats Carlos Alcaraz this time around. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761398_1_20240713031711.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic swept past Lorenzo Musetti on Friday to book a second successive Wimbledon final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and move one win away from a record-setting 25th Grand Slam title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just five weeks after undergoing knee surgery, seven-time Wimbledon champion Djokovic reached his 10th final at the All England Club with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 win over the Italian 25th seed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alcaraz earlier defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to reach a fourth Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic, 37, can equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon titles and become the tournament's oldest champion of the modern era if he avenges last year's dramatic five-set final loss to Alcaraz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time Djokovic and Musetti met was at the French Open in June when the Serb claimed victory in a third round tie which ended at 3:07 in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, however, Djokovic was untroubled on his way to a 37th Grand Slam final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He broke for 4-2 lead in the opener and, despite surrendering the advantage and letting two set points slip in the ninth game, he broke again in the 10th to claim the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second seed was playing in his 49th Grand Slam semi-final while the 22-year-old Musetti was in his first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That experience was key as Djokovic hit back from losing serve in the opening game of the second set to level in the sixth before dominating the tie-break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A break in the opening game of the third set launched him on his way to victory against a demoralised Musetti, who at least had the consolation of saving three match points before Djokovic completed his progress to yet another Wimbledon final. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of prisoners are to be released early from September in order to prevent the "collapse" of the prisons system, the UK's new justice minister announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Shabana Mahmood said failure to do so risked the "total breakdown of law and order," with just 700 places left for men, and jails operating at 99 percent capacity since 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England and Wales have the highest per capita prison population in Western Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said this week that urgent action was required, as prisons were at "breaking point."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release initiative would not apply to violent offenders serving more than four years, sex offenders and those in prison for domestic abuse offences as well as those on life sentences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood, appointed last week after Labour's general election win, warned in dramatic language that if prisons ran out of cell space, there could be "van-loads of dangerous people circling the country with nowhere to go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With officers unable to act, criminals could do whatever they want, without consequence. We could see looters running amok, smashing in windows, robbing shops and setting neighbourhoods alight," she said in a speech at a prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In short, if we fail to act now, we face the collapse of the criminal justice system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood accused the previous Conservative government of a "dereliction of duty" regarding the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her comments echoed Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who earlier told reporters while attending a Nato summit in the United States that the ousted Tories were guilty of "gross irresponsibility."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The scale of the problem was worse than we thought," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood's Conservative predecessor in the post, Alex Chalk, had reportedly pressed prime minister Rishi Sunak to impose similar measures before the election, but was overruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Labour's plans, prisoners who are eligible for automatic release after serving half their sentence will be freed earlier than the normal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plans involve a temporary reduction of how long prisoners must serve behind bars, from 50 percent to 40 percent of their sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The releases will start in September to give the Prison and Probation Service time to plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahmood also announced the recruitment of 1,000 additional trainee probation officers by next March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The total number of prisoners hit over 87,505 on Friday – of whom 83,755 were men – leaving just 1,451 spaces available, official figures showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of 2023, the average occupancy rate in men's prisons had "routinely been higher than 99 percent," according to the Ministry of Justice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say the prison system needs a buffer of around 1,425 cell spaces in men's prisons at all time to deal with sudden influxes of inmates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six new prisons to create an extra 20,000 places are being built – of which about 10,000 will be ready by the end of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Prison Governors' Association (PGA) said it welcomed the speed of the new measures while demanding a "full review" and that "the public must never be placed in this position again."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  PGA chairman Mark Fairhurst said the measures would free up around 4,500-5,000 more spaces and give prisons around 12 to 18 months before further steps would be needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Prison Reform Trust chief executive Pia Sinha said ministers "had the good sense to listen to the advice of its officials and introduce further emergency measures." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 16 students were killed on Friday when a school in central Nigeria collapsed on pupils taking exams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trapped students cried for help under the rubble after the Saint Academy school in Jos North district of Plateau State fell in on classrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents desperately looked for their children as rescue workers tried to reach the victims with heavy machinery. Images from the scene showed crowds gathering round a caved-in concrete building and heaps of debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials have so far only said "several students" were killed but a witness saw five dead bodies in one hospital morgue and 11 in another. All were wearing school uniforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his mother at his hospital bedside, injured student Wulliya Ibrahim said: "I entered the class not more than five minutes, when I heard a sound, and the next thing is I found myself here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are many in the class, we are writing our exams," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Emergency Management Agency said the two-storey building housing Saint Academy collapsed killing "several students."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had completed the search and rescue operation and would provide details later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chika Obioha, a resident at the scene, said he saw at least eight bodies at the site and that dozens more had been injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone is helping out to see if we can rescue more people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 15 rescued and injured students were admitted to the Our Lady of Apostles Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse but residents said it came after three days of heavy rains in Plateau. (AFP)

    England great Anderson ends Test career on a high

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"Playing for England is the best job in the world" said James Anderson. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761389_1_20240713002102.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England great James Anderson said he felt "really proud" after bringing down the curtain on a remarkable Test career with a thumping win over the West Indies at Lord's.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His final appearance before international retirement saw the 41-year-old paceman take a typically frugal 3-32 in 16 overs as the West Indies were dismissed for just 136 on Friday to give England victory by an innings and 114 runs inside three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The England selectors had already agreed with Anderson that this first of a three-match series would represent his farewell to national on-field service as they look to rebuild ahead of the 2025/26 Ashes series in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anderson, now set to mentor England's quicks for the rest of the season, bowed out with a remarkable 704 wickets from 188 Tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only spinners Shane Warne (708 Test wickets) and Muttiah Muralitharan (800) have enjoyed more bowling success at this level, with India batting hero Sachin Tendulkar (200 matches) the lone cricketer to have played more Tests than Anderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been quite an amazing week," Anderson told Sky Sports. "I've been overwhelmed with the reaction of the crowd and everyone around the ground, and the lads as well. I'm just proud of what I've achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously this morning was quite emotional with the two teams lined up, and the reaction from the crowd was pretty special. I'm still trying to hold them (tears) back now but I think I am just really proud," added Anderson after ending his Test career where it started – with a debut against Zimbabwe at Lord's in 2003.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for 20-odd years is an incredible effort, especially for a fast bowler, so I'm just happy that I've made it this far, happy that I've been lucky enough to stay injury-free pretty much throughout my career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Playing for England is the best job in the world and I've been privileged to do it for a long time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  England captain Ben Stokes hailed Anderson by saying: "He has just been an incredible inspiration to so many people...The amount of games and the amount of wickets he's taken are just absolutely phenomenal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes you can be lost for words but if you gave me 15 minutes I wouldn't be able to compliment him enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was a sense of a torch being passed at Lord's, with debutant fast bowler Gus Atkinson named player of the match following a sensational haul of 12-106.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By taking 12 wickets in his first Test, he managed something Anderson was unable to achieve in 188, with the Lancashire swing specialist's best match return at this level 11-71 against Pakistan at Trent Bridge in 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been an incredible week," said Atkinson. "I just want to say thanks to Jimmy. Playing here in his last Test has been incredible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old Surrey quick, asked if he had idolised Anderson as a child, replied: "A hundred percent. Growing up Jimmy was someone I would come to Lord's and watch. I was standing at mid-off thinking I had seen that so many times on the TV. It was amazing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite summed up many an opposition batsman's view of Anderson by saying: "He is a legend of the game. I won't miss him at all!" (AFP)

    US producer inflation higher than anticipated in June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some analysts expect US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to announce an interest rate cut in September. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761387_1_20240713001038.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US wholesale prices picked up more than expected in June due to service costs, the government reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.2 percent last month, while an initially-reported decline in May was revised upwards, said the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figures come after a cooler than expected consumer inflation reading, which fanned hopes of the US central bank cutting interest rates as soon as September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federal Reserve has been battling to bring stubborn inflation back to its longer-term two percent target by keeping rates high, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted "modest" progress on prices recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, government data showed the consumer price index – a key gauge of inflation – rose 3.0 percent from a year ago, a slowdown from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts said the latest PPI data is unlikely to worry the Fed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the PPI report, a 0.6 percent increase in services costs bumped the overall index higher, the Labour Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From a year ago, PPI rose 2.6 percent in June, the largest gain since increasing 2.7 percent in March 2023, the report added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But an underlying measure stripping out food, energy and trade services was unchanged in June after a 0.2 percent rise in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some analysts expect the Fed could signal in its July meeting that it intends to lower rates in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although slightly hotter than expected, a modest rise in the producer price index for June still keeps input prices on a supportive path for cooler inflation prints ahead," said Ben Ayers, senior economist for Nationwide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a media interview on Thursday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said: "I do think with the incoming information on inflation, growth and the labour market, some policy adjustments are likely to be warranted." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday led a number of senior officials to attend the Hong Kong-Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He told delegates with the SAR government enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law this year, Hong Kong could now focus on economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the areas of co-operation, the SAR government said it was studying with its Shenzhen counterparts on ways to build a clinical trial co-operative platform within the Lok Ma Chau Loop area, also known as the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it would set up a clinical trial institute in the Loop area by the end of this year, with the aim of providing trials for the entire Greater Bay Area population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said Hong Kong and its bay area counterparts would work to build an international medical innovation hub in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute was first mentioned in Chief Executive John Lee's policy address last year.

 A Russian regional airliner carrying three crew members crashed in a forested area near Moscow on Friday, killing all on board, Russian news agencies reported.

  <br/>
  The plane was a Superjet 100 regional jet and was carrying out a "test flight" before crashing near the Russian city of Kolomna, the TASS news agency said.
  <br/>

  The cause of the crash was not clear.

 China said on Friday it was conducting joint military drills with Russia along its southern coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry said the two militaries had begun the exercises, called Joint Sea-2024, in early July, and they would last until the middle of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drills in the waters and airspace around Zhanjiang, in Guangdong province, are "to demonstrate the resolve and capabilities of the two sides in jointly addressing maritime security threats and preserving global and regional peace and stability", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the exercises "will further deepen China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese forces are also staging drills this week with Belarus near Poland.

 A landslide swept two passenger buses carrying at least 63 people into a swollen river in central Nepal early Friday while continuous rain and more landslides were making rescue efforts difficult.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three survivors apparently swam to safety, but rescuers by late morning had not found any trace of the buses, which likely were submerged and swept downstream in the Trishuli River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy monsoon downpours in the past few days have swollen the waterways and turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buses were on the key highway connecting the capital to southern parts of Nepal when they were swept away around 3am near Simaltal, about 120 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More landslides blocked routes to the area in several places, officials said. Additional rescuers and security forces were sent to help with the rescue efforts. Police and army personnel were searching using rubber rafts. Divers with scuba gear were also dispatched, according to the Chitwan district police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bus was hit by another landslide on Friday morning a short distance away on the same highway. Officials said the driver was killed but it was not clear if there were any other casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was saddened by the news and expressed concern over recent flooding and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that several government agencies were searching for the missing, in a post on the social media platform X. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical sector lawmaker on Friday called for harsher punishments for senior managers responsible for medical incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority set up a review committee earlier this month to look at the operations and incident response policies at public hospitals following a series of blunders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmaker David Lam, who is one of the committee members, said senior managers should be held accountable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it's just about having senior management to come to meet with the press, bow their head, express their concern for the affected families, and deduct some bonus or welfare benefits to the staff concerned, that's not enough. We should not just shift the responsibility to frontline staff," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review committee will examine existing mechanisms to monitor performance and look at systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit its recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

    Tai Lam Tunnel toll plan sparks debate in legislature

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it has reservations about making the Tai Lam Tunnel free. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761327_1_20240712160232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whether the Tai Lam Tunnel should be free at certain times was up for debate among lawmakers on Friday, with the government expressing reservations about the suggestion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most legislators agreed, however, that the administration should charge time-varying tolls after it takes control of the New Territories tunnel next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier, officials outlined three different pricing scenarios, including two fixed toll proposals and a third with different fares for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed staggered tolls, private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 or HK$20 depending on the time of day. Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Chun-san, the undersecretary for transport and logistics, said the government has reservations about making the tunnel free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reduction is not acceptable for the point of view of the use of public money and traffic management. We have to make sure that the traffic is smooth, and to maintain the tunnel, we need to charge a toll," Liu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers, including New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip, said they believe fees are necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to let people know the infrastructure is a massive public investment and we should make the best use and do not abuse any infrastructure. We have to let people know that resources are valuable. So I'm against an infrastructure service free of charge," Ip said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edward Lau of the DAB said he would not support any of the three pricing scenarios put forward by the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the new tunnels... all of these are offered for use free of charge. Why do you adopt a different principle for the Tai Lam Tunnel?" Lau asked.

 As part of the "100% Doraemon & Friends Tour (Hong Kong)", ticket holders can view an expansive indoors and outdoors exhibition at K11 Musea in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Those that do not have tickets can view a Doraemon exhibition at the Avenue of Stars for free, where there will be 34 1:1 life-sized sculptures of different versions of Doraemon along with 10 friends of the beloved blue cartoon character.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from the exhibitions, other activities include "The Doraemon Drone Show", which will return to Victoria Harbour on July 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on that day, "100% Friends-Calling Bell" themed trains will park at Sha Tin MTR Station and at the Light Rail's Siu Hong stop so fans can take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, said he believes this will be a good large-scale event for Hong Kong, adding that Doraemon is a cherished part of many Hongkongers' childhood memories.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

    Govt urged to raise number of hire-car permits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers discussed a government proposal to regulate online car-hailing platforms. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761307_1_20240712125139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have urged the government to increase the number of permits for ride-hailing services, saying authorities have to ensure healthy competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of permits is currently capped at 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Friday, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the threshold to apply for a permit is too stringent, and that online ride-hailing services are a rising trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another legislator, Chan Pui-leung, said the government should not keep online car-hailing services “on a tight leash”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to uphold one principle – regulation is meant to promote healthy growth of the industry,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, for his part, said regulating such platforms should come hand-in-hand with issuing more hire-car permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If [the administration] is just regulating the platforms without issuing licences, and if only taxis are able to provide personalised point-to-point business, then people would be discouraged from taking taxis because of their poor service quality,” the legislator said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we don’t have enough competition in the market, people and tourists will be the losers… We don’t want to have an impression that the government is tilting in favour of the taxi industry.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport chief Lam Sai-hung said the government's regulation plan does not favour the taxi trade, and the administration will “listen to opinions and look at data” when drawing up its legislative proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to ensure the safety of passengers and their rights, and also have to pay attention to the healthy development of the transport industry. I don’t think the two are mutually exclusive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we want to see a healthy development of the industry, and given the two broad principles, we need to strike a balance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is planning to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. Anyone found to be involved in providing illegal services could have their driving licence suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will conduct a study to review passenger demand before presenting a legislative proposal next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has criticised a move by Germany to remove Chinese telecom components from its 5G networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany on Thursday said it will phase out the use of components made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks, citing national security concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said critical components from Huawei and ZTE will be barred from 5G core networks by the end of 2026, while “critical management systems” from the two manufacturers in 5G access and transport networks must be replaced by the end of 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Berlin said Germany's decision was based on "groundless accusations", adding that Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE have long operated in the country in compliance with laws and regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement also said the move by Berlin would severely damage mutual trust and affect future cooperation between China and the European Union in relevant fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei said there was no specific evidence that the firm's "technology has cyber security risks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Huawei has developed into a continuously innovative, secure, and reliable telecom equipment supplier in the German market," a spokesperson said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China does not accept the groundless accusations made at the recent Nato summit in Washington against Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a phone call with his Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp, Wang said Nato should stay within its bounds and refrain from interfering in China's or Asia-Pacific affairs, and from challenging Beijing's legitimate rights and interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foreign minister said China and Nato countries have different political systems and values, but this should not be a reason for the alliance to "instigate confrontation with China".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing is willing to maintain contact with Nato on "an equal footing" and conduct exchanges on the basis of mutual respect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato has accused China of playing a key role in helping Russia's assault on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On ties between China and the Netherlands, Wang said Beijing is willing to strengthen cooperation with Amsterdam to jointly safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veldkamp said the Dutch side does not support "decoupling" from China and is willing to maintain communication with Beijing. (Xinhua, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    Lawmakers divided on penalty for ignoring child abuse

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There are divided views on penalties for professionals who fail to report child abuse cases, with one lawmaker saying tougher punishments are needed to boost the deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien made the comment a day after Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, requiring 25 types of workers such as doctors and teachers to report suspected cases of serious harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who fail to do so will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tien, who cast the only abstention vote, said on an RTHK programme that he thinks the jail term should be extended to a year instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In today's Hong Kong, a maximum penalty of one year in jail applies to most laws... What penalties are less than a year nowadays? Only for very trivial offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing a child being continuously sexually assaulted and not saying anything is outrageous. When I think of the three-month jail term, I have nothing to say."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on the same programme, Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said he believes the three-month maximum jail term is sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do higher penalties mean better social effects? I don't think so. A one-year jail term will make everyone feel scared and suspicious," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who chaired the bills committee for the new legislation, said he hopes professionals will actively follow up on child abuse cases.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau says there has been a gradual rebound in the local retail sector, with more stores opening across the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Yau was asked if there’s been a wave of shop closures in Hong Kong amid a drop in retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce and economic development chief said that while the government does not have statistics on store closures, recent surveys have pointed to an improvement in retail occupancy rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said figures indicated that the number of vacant stores dropped from 18.3 percent in the third quarter of 2020 to around 6.6 percent recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can see that the situation is improving gradually,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But some people may say, there are still a lot of vacant shops. Well, a change in the commercial environment as well as people’s spending behaviour may mean that some retailers no longer need so many physical stores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yau said there’s also been an increase in the number of mainland and overseas companies setting up shop in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the first half of this year, InvestHK helped 322 firms set up business in the SAR, compared to 383 companies in the whole of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this indicates that non-local companies are confident in Hong Kong and are hoping to use the SAR as a stepping stone to enter the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said the implementation of a real-name registration system for SIM cards has proven effective in combating telephone scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that as of late May, telecom companies had rejected around 2.4 million SIM card applications and terminated almost 1.8 million unregistered cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his bureau has been working closely with the police to block suspicious calls, adding that more work will be done in this area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory over the final straight on Thursday to complete Stage 12 of the Tour de France in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Girmay of Eritrea outlasted Wout van Aert of Belgium and Arnaud Demare of France to finish in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds and capture his third stage of the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Ackermann of Germany ended up in third after Demare was demoted to 67th place for pushing van Aert to the barriers during the 204-km stage that brought riders from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time Grand Tour champion Primoz Roglic of Slovenia was involved in his second crash in as many days, with Thursday's slip-up coming near the finish line. Roglic finished 2:27 after Girmay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, there were no changes atop the leaderboard. Two-time Tour champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia retained the yellow jersey, 1:06 ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel and 1:14 ahead of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark.

    Biden introduces Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Thursday mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky as "President Putin" before correcting himself at the Nato summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said, referring to Zelensky, before correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to beat President Putin, President Zelensky. I am so focused on beating Putin," Biden said while correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The room at the summit gasped when Biden misidentified Zelensky as Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been under intense scrutiny in recent days and has faced doubts, including from members of his own Democratic Party, about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a debate late last month against Republican former President Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday, Biden plans to hold a solo press conference at the Nato summit, his first time facing the press alone since November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's remarks on Thursday came as Nato members extended support to Ukraine to combat the Russian assault that began in February 2022.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky is calling on Kyiv's backers to allow his outgunned forces greater scope to strike deeper inside Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761250_1_20240712052011.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called on Nato leaders to drop all restrictions on letting Kyiv strike inside Russia with Western weaponry as they wrapped up a three-day summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled 75th anniversary gala in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering has been overshadowed by uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden – who will give a press conference on Thursday – fights for his own political survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian leader joined his Nato counterparts after receiving promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as allies began the transfer of long-promised F-16 jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further – including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to win, if we want to prevail, if we want to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key allies such as Washington and Germany relaxed conditions on Ukraine hitting inside Russia in May in response to Moscow's offensive toward the second city Kharkiv, but they kept in place some limits on how far and under which circumstances Kyiv could strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only way to hit military targets, missile launchers or airfields which are conducting attacks against Ukraine is to hit military targets on Russian territory, because the frontline and the borderline is more or less the same," Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato allies have put together a package of support for Ukraine including the pledge of more Patriot missile systems to defend the skies over the war-torn country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky said he hoped to see the air defenses – including one new Patriot system from the United States – delivered "as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato's leaders at the summit once again risked disappointing Zelensky by refusing to issue Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a bid to soften any upset, leaders called Ukraine's path to membership "irreversible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros (US$43 billion) in military support "within the next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a Nato member, and I am confident we will achieve this," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster Nato's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin "episodic deployments" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would "have significantly longer range" than current US systems in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the move and said it would help in "securing peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning "response measures" to contain the "very serious threat" from Nato, accusing the alliance of being "fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN meanwhile reported that the United States foiled a Russian plot earlier this year to assassinate the chief executive of a major German arms maker supplying weaponry to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said he did not want to comment on those specific reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said there has been "a Russian campaign organised by the security services to conduct hostile actions against Nato allies, across the alliance, with sabotage attempts, with cyber attacks, with arson, with different types of hostile actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine, and what we have seen over the last months that Nato allies have not been intimidated," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the sit-down with Zelensky, Nato shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato agreed to several initiatives with the partner countries, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine with non-lethal help. (AFP)

    Streak of records ends for Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent as investors moved away from artificial intelligence stocks. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761248_1_20240712043453.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell on Thursday, snapping a multiday run of records as investors shifted towards underbought equities and away from artificial intelligence names.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pivot came as the yield on US Treasury bonds fell further amid rising expectations of interest rate cuts after better US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.1 percent at 39,753.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 5,584, while the Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent to 18,283, snapping a run of seven straight records on the tech-focused index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While two of the three indices finished in negative territory due to weakness in Nvidia, Apple and other tech equities that have led the market in 2024, analysts noted that the majority of equities moved higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What's being bought is the laggards," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's the start of a healthy rotation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall consumer prices declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, US data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The better-than-expected reading comes as markets increasingly wager that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets now see around an 85 percent chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Delta fell 3.9 percent after reporting a 29 percent drop in quarterly profits to US$1.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier scored record revenues for the June quarter but said it would temper plans to add capacity in the second half of 2024 due to moderating demand. American Airlines and United Airlines also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla plunged 7.9 percent following a report that Elon Musk's electric auto giant will delay a much anticipated "robotaxi" event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unveiling was originally planned for August 8, but Tesla has pushed the event back until October to give teams more time, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the decision. (AFP)

    Krejcikova stuns Rybakina, faces Paolini in final

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Barbora Krejcikova celebrates after beating Elena Rybakina on Centre Court at Wimbledon. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761246_1_20240712035538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon final after battling back for a shock 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just hours after Paolini beat tearful Croatian Donna Vekic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) in the longest ever women's semi-final at the All England Club, it was Krejcikova's turn to dig deep for victory against fourth seeded Rybakina in two hours and seven minutes on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova faces seventh seed Paolini on Saturday in what will be the second Grand Slam final of the 28-year-old's career after her French Open triumph in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today," said Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech started 2024 with a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, but a first round exit at the French Open was a major setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She struggled with a back injury and illness, winning just three singles matches in the five months before finally finding her form in remarkable style at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova shocked 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, before turning her sights on Rybakina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon doubles champion is now one win away from an unexpected triumph in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable. It is very tough to explain, but a lot of joy and a lot of emotions," Krejcikova said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I broke her in the second set, I started to be in the zone and I didn't want to leave the zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rybakina had been in formidable form, dropping just one set as she extended her impressive All England Club record to 19 wins from 21 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2022, made a fast start with two quick breaks for an early 4-0 lead in a one-sided first set against Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first Wimbledon semi-final, Krejcikova turned the tide in the second set, landing a priceless break in the sixth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She levelled the match on her sixth set point, making it the first time in 20 years that both Wimbledon women's semi-finals had gone to the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech held all the momentum and she eventually wore down Rybakina, who had committed over 35 unforced errors by the time she surrendered her serve in the decisive, seventh game of the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini had never won a main draw match at Wimbledon before this year, but the world number seven tenaciously saw off Vekic in two hours and 51 minutes to secure a second successive Grand Slam final appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old, who lost the French Open final to Iga Swiatek last month, is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini, who also made the Australia Open last 16 in January, had not gone past the second round in any Slam before this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without a win at the All England Club heading into the tournament, Paolini now has six victories under her belt and has dropped just two sets in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last months have been crazy for me. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this Wimbledon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know there is no place better than here to fight for every ball and every point. I will remember this forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vekic paid the price for 57 unforced errors, with the semi-final fittingly ending on another wild forehand from the unseeded Croatian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unable to contain her frustration at letting 3-1 and 4-3 leads slip in the last set, Vekic broke down in tears in the closing stages of a rollercoaster clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was crying because I had so much pain. I didn't know how I could keep playing," Vekic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to die in the third set. I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shelley Duvall, the versatile actor known for her role in "The Shining" and working relationship with director Robert Altman, died on Thursday aged 75.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citing her partner Dan Gilroy, The Hollywood Reporter said Duvall died in her sleep at her home in Blanco, Texas following complications of diabetes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born July 7, 1949 in Fort Worth, Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman – the maverick filmmaker known for his rich characters, sharp social criticism and keen satire – who cast her in 1970's dark comedy "Brewster McCloud."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The saucer-eyed actor developed a broad repertoire, breaking through with 1975's "Nashville," and going on to portray memorable and eccentric characters that earned her a smattering of awards including at Cannes for her role in the acclaimed 1977 drama "3 Women."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career was defined by her work with Altman, who she said she kept working with because "he offers me damn good roles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of them have been alike," she told The New York Times in 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was her role in the film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" that would become one of her highest profile roles, as she played opposite Jack Nicholson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Stanley Kubrick put her through the ringer to perform the part of Wendy Torrance in the horror classic that sees a writer husband descend into homicidal madness and terrorise his wife and young son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall told People in 1981 the 13-month job was gruelling, and that Kubrick had her "crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous scene Nicholson's character tortures Duvall's with a baseball bat, which reportedly took 127 takes to satisfy Kubrick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall also made a cameo in 1977's "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, and played opposite Robin Williams in Altman's 1980 live-action rendition of "Popeye."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the 1980s she made her way into children's programming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gilroy – a musician who was part of the Breakfast Club and had dated Madonna – was her longtime partner after the pair met on the 1990 Disney Channel Movie "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley," The Hollywood Reporter quoted Gilroy as saying. (AFP)

    EU accepts Apple plan to let rivals access tap-to-pay

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Competitors will now be able to compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops in the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761239_1_20240712004748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Thursday approved Apple's offer to allow rivals access to the iPhone's ability to tap-to-pay within the bloc, ending a lengthy probe and sparing it a heavy fine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case dates back to 2022 when Brussels first accused Apple of blocking rivals from its popular iPhone tap payment system in a breach of EU competition law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding," EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to "tap-as-you-go" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes must remain in force for 10 years and a "monitoring trustee" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro (US$1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto announced on Thursday the dismissal of almost his entire cabinet and consultations to form a "broad-based government" following widespread anti-government protests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the move affects all ministers including the attorney-general but excluded prime cabinet secretary and foreign minister Musalia Mudavadi and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said he decided on the dismissals "upon reflection, listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said and after a holistic appraisal of the performance of my cabinet and its achievements and challenges."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action follows largely peaceful protests led by young Gen-Z Kenyans that have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into deadly violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto also said he will "immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This government would, he said, help him to develop "radical programmes" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and "slay the dragon of corruption." (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases more than expected

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden issued a statement saying the report shows the US is making significant progress in fighting inflation. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761230_1_20240711215505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation cooled more than expected in June, government data showed on Thursday, a positive development for President Joe Biden as he fights to win confidence on his economic record in his reelection bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.0 percent last month from a year ago, said the Labour Department, as a drop in petrol prices more than offset housing costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices also saw the smallest annual rise since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's report shows that we are making significant progress fighting inflation," Biden said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While costs of cars and appliances are falling, he conceded that prices remain too high and pledged to "do everything I can for the working people that built our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A consensus forecast of analysts initially expected consumer inflation at 3.1 percent, down from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy has been on a bumpy path to reining in inflation, which soared to a blistering 9.1 percent in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This prompted the central bank to rapidly hike interest rates in hopes of easing demand and bringing down price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that there has since been "modest" progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall CPI declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, Labour Department data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "core" CPI index excluding the volatile food and energy was up 3.3 percent on-year, the smallest jump since April 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The improvement on the inflation front recently is good news for growth in real disposable income, which matters for consumer spending," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that spending "hit a lull" in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report adds to a series of encouraging data that could give officials confidence that inflation is coming down to their two-percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, in turn, would allow them to start cutting decades-high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobs market, another segment that Fed policymakers are monitoring, has also returned to a "strong, but not overheated" state, Powell said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A further deceleration in prices and labour market cooldown would "support a change in message from the Fed" at its July policy meeting, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could open the door to rate cuts as soon as the September meeting, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said: "We still have a ways to go yet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While shelter inflation has noticeably eased, he maintained that housing has been a major factor behind the stickiness of figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't see relief in the housing market for some period of time after the Fed starts to cut rates," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Fed starts cutting in September, it's going to be months and months before we see enough significant movement in the 30-year mortgage to make a difference," he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A documentary produced jointly by China Media Group (CMG) and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) will showcase the unique charm of Hong Kong's culinary culture to the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a launch ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the documentary "Taste of Hong Kong" is an important milestone as it is the first joint production of the two broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said CMG's cooperation with RTHK has supported the SAR in various ways, including the donation of a number of high-quality programmes for RTHK for broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cooperation has not only further enhanced Hong Kong people's understanding of the country, but also promoted the city's integration into the country's overall development, while promoting Chinese culture to the international community, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Wang Xiaozhen, Vice President of CMG, said the group has fulfilled its duties and mission as part of state media by working closely with the Hong Kong government to tell the city's story, promote quality development and showcase the charm of Chinese culture. He said it has achieved a number of fruitful results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said he hoped the documentary will encourage more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that RTHK will play an active role by working closely with mainland broadcast media, while acting as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.

    Ex-Indonesian minister gets 10 years in jail for graft

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s anti-graft court sentenced a former agriculture minister to 10 years in prison on Thursday after finding him guilty of corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case has tarnished President Joko Widodo’s credibility in fighting corruption. Five other members of Widodo’s cabinet had been sentenced to prison terms in corruption cases, casting a shadow over his efforts to clean up government before his term ends in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court in the capital, Jakarta, ruled that the former cabinet minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, was guilty of abusing his power by enriching himself and other officials. It also ordered him to pay a 300 million rupiah fine, and said he would be subject to another four months’ imprisonment if he fails to pay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. “He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Limpo was arrested last October by the Corruption Eradication Commission, known as the KPK. He has denied wrongdoing. (AP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A new survey showed that nursing and education were the most popular subject choices among this year's DSE candidates. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761194_1_20240711171436.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ninety percent of this year’s DSE candidates hoped to continue their education in Hong Kong, according to a survey conducted by the Quality People Resources Limited between November and January this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It polled 3,236 DSE takers from 41 secondary schools across Hong Kong, aiming to examine students’ preferences in continuing education and taking up employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s director Edward Chan on Thursday said students hoped to stay in the city mostly due to convenience and the fact that they view Hong Kong as their home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For local students, convenience, parent’s expectations, or scholarship, sponsorship, or Hong Kong is their home…[these are why they would prefer to stay in Hong Kong],” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four percent of candidates hoped to continue their education on the mainland, and six percent overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese University and Polytechnic University were the most popular choices among students, with 22.4 percent and 16.4 percent of students hoping to be admitted respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nursing was the most desirable subject among students at 13.5 percent, followed by education at 12.44 percent and psychology at 12.41 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This echoes with the most preferred job industry among students, with education at 16.4 percent and nursing at 13.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that students tend to select subjects according to their DSE results and personal interests, followed by industry trends related to their preferred majors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also saw an increase in preference in selecting Hong Kong as the future working location for graduates, with a rise from 76 percent last year to 81 percent this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that personal interests, at 58.9 percent of candidates, remained the top priority among students this year when choosing their career, followed by salary and benefits at 54.9 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The living cost in Hong Kong is very high. Students can see the high cost of rent, transport and food, therefore they will consider this first [when choosing their subjects]. Therefore students are indoctrinated with the thought that they will need to acquire a certain salary level to live in Hong Kong,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said it would consider the increase of university tuition fees starting from the 2025/26 academic year for their survey next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50,800 DSE candidates will receive their exam results next Wednesday.
