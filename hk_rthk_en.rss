 China said on Friday it was conducting joint military drills with Russia along its southern coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry said the two militaries had begun the exercises, called Joint Sea-2024, in early July, and they would last until the middle of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drills in the waters and airspace around Zhanjiang, in Guangdong province, are "to demonstrate the resolve and capabilities of the two sides in jointly addressing maritime security threats and preserving global and regional peace and stability", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the exercises "will further deepen China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese forces are also staging drills this week with Belarus near Poland.

  Meanwhile, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Zhao Leji, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the 10th BRICS Parliamentary Forum in St. Petersburg.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landslide swept two passenger buses carrying at least 63 people into a swollen river in central Nepal early Friday while continuous rain and more landslides were making rescue efforts difficult.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three survivors apparently swam to safety, but rescuers by late morning had not found any trace of the buses, which likely were submerged and swept downstream in the Trishuli River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy monsoon downpours in the past few days have swollen the waterways and turned their waters murky brown, making it even more difficult to see the wreckage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The buses were on the key highway connecting the capital to southern parts of Nepal when they were swept away around 3am near Simaltal, about 120 kilometres west of Kathmandu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More landslides blocked routes to the area in several places, officials said. Additional rescuers and security forces were sent to help with the rescue efforts. Police and army personnel were searching using rubber rafts. Divers with scuba gear were also dispatched, according to the Chitwan district police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A third bus was hit by another landslide on Friday morning a short distance away on the same highway. Officials said the driver was killed but it was not clear if there were any other casualties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was saddened by the news and expressed concern over recent flooding and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that several government agencies were searching for the missing, in a post on the social media platform X. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A medical sector lawmaker on Friday called for harsher punishments for senior managers responsible for medical incidents at public hospitals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority set up a review committee earlier this month to look at the operations and incident response policies at public hospitals following a series of blunders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmaker David Lam, who is one of the committee members, said senior managers should be held accountable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If it's just about having senior management to come to meet with the press, bow their head, express their concern for the affected families, and deduct some bonus or welfare benefits to the staff concerned, that's not enough. We should not just shift the responsibility to frontline staff," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The review committee will examine existing mechanisms to monitor performance and look at systems to manage risk and accountability, as well as incident response policies at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will submit its recommendations to the authority's governing board within three months.

    Tai Lam Tunnel toll plan sparks debate in legislature

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says it has reservations about making the Tai Lam Tunnel free. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761327_1_20240712160232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Whether the Tai Lam Tunnel should be free at certain times was up for debate among lawmakers on Friday, with the government expressing reservations about the suggestion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Most legislators agreed, however, that the administration should charge time-varying tolls after it takes control of the New Territories tunnel next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier, officials outlined three different pricing scenarios, including two fixed toll proposals and a third with different fares for peak, regular and off-peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the proposed staggered tolls, private car drivers would pay HK$45, HK$35 or HK$20 depending on the time of day. Taxi drivers would pay HK$30 at all times, while commercial vehicles would be charged HK$45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu Chun-san, the undersecretary for transport and logistics, said the government has reservations about making the tunnel free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reduction is not acceptable for the point of view of the use of public money and traffic management. We have to make sure that the traffic is smooth, and to maintain the tunnel, we need to charge a toll," Liu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some lawmakers, including New People’s Party chairwoman Regina Ip, said they believe fees are necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to let people know the infrastructure is a massive public investment and we should make the best use and do not abuse any infrastructure. We have to let people know that resources are valuable. So I'm against an infrastructure service free of charge," Ip said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edward Lau of the DAB said he would not support any of the three pricing scenarios put forward by the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the new tunnels... all of these are offered for use free of charge. Why do you adopt a different principle for the Tai Lam Tunnel?" Lau asked.

 As part of the "100% Doraemon & Friends Tour (Hong Kong)", ticket holders can view an expansive indoors and outdoors exhibition at K11 Musea in Tsim Sha Tsui.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Those that do not have tickets can view a Doraemon exhibition at the Avenue of Stars for free, where there will be 34 1:1 life-sized sculptures of different versions of Doraemon along with 10 friends of the beloved blue cartoon character.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from the exhibitions, other activities include "The Doraemon Drone Show", which will return to Victoria Harbour on July 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on that day, "100% Friends-Calling Bell" themed trains will park at Sha Tin MTR Station and at the Light Rail's Siu Hong stop so fans can take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, said he believes this will be a good large-scale event for Hong Kong, adding that Doraemon is a cherished part of many Hongkongers' childhood memories.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers discussed a government proposal to regulate online car-hailing platforms. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761307_1_20240712125139.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have urged the government to increase the number of permits for ride-hailing services, saying authorities have to ensure healthy competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number of permits is currently capped at 1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting on Friday, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the threshold to apply for a permit is too stringent, and that online ride-hailing services are a rising trend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another legislator, Chan Pui-leung, said the government should not keep online car-hailing services “on a tight leash”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to uphold one principle – regulation is meant to promote healthy growth of the industry,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Chan Siu-hung, for his part, said regulating such platforms should come hand-in-hand with issuing more hire-car permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If [the administration] is just regulating the platforms without issuing licences, and if only taxis are able to provide personalised point-to-point business, then people would be discouraged from taking taxis because of their poor service quality,” the legislator said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we don’t have enough competition in the market, people and tourists will be the losers… We don’t want to have an impression that the government is tilting in favour of the taxi industry.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport chief Lam Sai-hung said the government's regulation plan does not favour the taxi trade, and the administration will “listen to opinions and look at data” when drawing up its legislative proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We want to ensure the safety of passengers and their rights, and also have to pay attention to the healthy development of the transport industry. I don’t think the two are mutually exclusive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we want to see a healthy development of the industry, and given the two broad principles, we need to strike a balance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration is planning to regulate online car-hailing platforms by requiring them to obtain a licence to operate. Anyone found to be involved in providing illegal services could have their driving licence suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will conduct a study to review passenger demand before presenting a legislative proposal next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has criticised a move by Germany to remove Chinese telecom components from its 5G networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany on Thursday said it will phase out the use of components made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks, citing national security concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said critical components from Huawei and ZTE will be barred from 5G core networks by the end of 2026, while “critical management systems” from the two manufacturers in 5G access and transport networks must be replaced by the end of 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Berlin said Germany's decision was based on "groundless accusations", adding that Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE have long operated in the country in compliance with laws and regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement also said the move by Berlin would severely damage mutual trust and affect future cooperation between China and the European Union in relevant fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei said there was no specific evidence that the firm's "technology has cyber security risks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Huawei has developed into a continuously innovative, secure, and reliable telecom equipment supplier in the German market," a spokesperson said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China does not accept the groundless accusations made at the recent Nato summit in Washington against Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a phone call with his Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp, Wang said Nato should stay within its bounds and refrain from interfering in China's or Asia-Pacific affairs, and from challenging Beijing's legitimate rights and interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foreign minister said China and Nato countries have different political systems and values, but this should not be a reason for the alliance to "instigate confrontation with China".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing is willing to maintain contact with Nato on "an equal footing" and conduct exchanges on the basis of mutual respect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato has accused China of playing a key role in helping Russia's assault on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On ties between China and the Netherlands, Wang said Beijing is willing to strengthen cooperation with Amsterdam to jointly safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veldkamp said the Dutch side does not support "decoupling" from China and is willing to maintain communication with Beijing. (Xinhua, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    Lawmakers divided on penalty for ignoring child abuse

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There are divided views on penalties for professionals who fail to report child abuse cases, with one lawmaker saying tougher punishments are needed to boost the deterrent effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien made the comment a day after Legco passed the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, requiring 25 types of workers such as doctors and teachers to report suspected cases of serious harm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who fail to do so will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tien, who cast the only abstention vote, said on an RTHK programme that he thinks the jail term should be extended to a year instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In today's Hong Kong, a maximum penalty of one year in jail applies to most laws... What penalties are less than a year nowadays? Only for very trivial offences," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing a child being continuously sexually assaulted and not saying anything is outrageous. When I think of the three-month jail term, I have nothing to say."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But speaking on the same programme, Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Bill Tang said he believes the three-month maximum jail term is sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Do higher penalties mean better social effects? I don't think so. A one-year jail term will make everyone feel scared and suspicious," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who chaired the bills committee for the new legislation, said he hopes professionals will actively follow up on child abuse cases.

    Retail sector is recovering: Algernon Yau

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Retail sector is recovering: Algernon Yau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761289_1_20240712110454.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau says there has been a gradual rebound in the local retail sector, with more stores opening across the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK on the second anniversary of the current government term, Yau was asked if there’s been a wave of shop closures in Hong Kong amid a drop in retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce and economic development chief said that while the government does not have statistics on store closures, recent surveys have pointed to an improvement in retail occupancy rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said figures indicated that the number of vacant stores dropped from 18.3 percent in the third quarter of 2020 to around 6.6 percent recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can see that the situation is improving gradually,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But some people may say, there are still a lot of vacant shops. Well, a change in the commercial environment as well as people’s spending behaviour may mean that some retailers no longer need so many physical stores.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yau said there’s also been an increase in the number of mainland and overseas companies setting up shop in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the first half of this year, InvestHK helped 322 firms set up business in the SAR, compared to 383 companies in the whole of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this indicates that non-local companies are confident in Hong Kong and are hoping to use the SAR as a stepping stone to enter the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said the implementation of a real-name registration system for SIM cards has proven effective in combating telephone scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that as of late May, telecom companies had rejected around 2.4 million SIM card applications and terminated almost 1.8 million unregistered cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his bureau has been working closely with the police to block suspicious calls, adding that more work will be done in this area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Biniam Girmay sprinted to victory over the final straight on Thursday to complete Stage 12 of the Tour de France in Villeneuve-sur-Lot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Girmay of Eritrea outlasted Wout van Aert of Belgium and Arnaud Demare of France to finish in 4 hours, 17 minutes, 15 seconds and capture his third stage of the Tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pascal Ackermann of Germany ended up in third after Demare was demoted to 67th place for pushing van Aert to the barriers during the 204-km stage that brought riders from Aurillac to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four-time Grand Tour champion Primoz Roglic of Slovenia was involved in his second crash in as many days, with Thursday's slip-up coming near the finish line. Roglic finished 2:27 after Girmay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, there were no changes atop the leaderboard. Two-time Tour champion Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia retained the yellow jersey, 1:06 ahead of Belgium's Remco Evenepoel and 1:14 ahead of two-time defending champion Jonas Vingegaard of Denmark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tour de France resumes Friday with Stage 13. (Reuters)

    Biden introduces Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Thursday mistakenly referred to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky as "President Putin" before correcting himself at the Nato summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin," Biden said, referring to Zelensky, before correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going to beat President Putin, President Zelensky. I am so focused on beating Putin," Biden said while correcting himself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The room at the summit gasped when Biden misidentified Zelensky as Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden has been under intense scrutiny in recent days and has faced doubts, including from members of his own Democratic Party, about his reelection chances after a weak and faltering performance in a debate late last month against Republican former President Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Thursday, Biden plans to hold a solo press conference at the Nato summit, his first time facing the press alone since November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's remarks on Thursday came as Nato members extended support to Ukraine to combat the Russian assault that began in February 2022.

    Zelensky urges Nato leaders to lift all strike limits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Volodymyr Zelensky is calling on Kyiv's backers to allow his outgunned forces greater scope to strike deeper inside Russia. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761250_1_20240712052011.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday called on Nato leaders to drop all restrictions on letting Kyiv strike inside Russia with Western weaponry as they wrapped up a three-day summit in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled 75th anniversary gala in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gathering has been overshadowed by uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden – who will give a press conference on Thursday – fights for his own political survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian leader joined his Nato counterparts after receiving promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as allies began the transfer of long-promised F-16 jets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zelensky called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further – including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to win, if we want to prevail, if we want to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Key allies such as Washington and Germany relaxed conditions on Ukraine hitting inside Russia in May in response to Moscow's offensive toward the second city Kharkiv, but they kept in place some limits on how far and under which circumstances Kyiv could strike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only way to hit military targets, missile launchers or airfields which are conducting attacks against Ukraine is to hit military targets on Russian territory, because the frontline and the borderline is more or less the same," Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato allies have put together a package of support for Ukraine including the pledge of more Patriot missile systems to defend the skies over the war-torn country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zelensky said he hoped to see the air defenses – including one new Patriot system from the United States – delivered "as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato's leaders at the summit once again risked disappointing Zelensky by refusing to issue Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a bid to soften any upset, leaders called Ukraine's path to membership "irreversible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros (US$43 billion) in military support "within the next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing and will continue to do everything to ensure that the day comes when Ukraine is invited and becomes a Nato member, and I am confident we will achieve this," Zelensky said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster Nato's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin "episodic deployments" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would "have significantly longer range" than current US systems in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the move and said it would help in "securing peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning "response measures" to contain the "very serious threat" from Nato, accusing the alliance of being "fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CNN meanwhile reported that the United States foiled a Russian plot earlier this year to assassinate the chief executive of a major German arms maker supplying weaponry to Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stoltenberg said he did not want to comment on those specific reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said there has been "a Russian campaign organised by the security services to conduct hostile actions against Nato allies, across the alliance, with sabotage attempts, with cyber attacks, with arson, with different types of hostile actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of this campaign is, of course, to intimidate Nato allies from supporting Ukraine, and what we have seen over the last months that Nato allies have not been intimidated," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the sit-down with Zelensky, Nato shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato agreed to several initiatives with the partner countries, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine with non-lethal help. (AFP)

    Streak of records ends for Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent as investors moved away from artificial intelligence stocks. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761248_1_20240712043453.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both fell on Thursday, snapping a multiday run of records as investors shifted towards underbought equities and away from artificial intelligence names.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pivot came as the yield on US Treasury bonds fell further amid rising expectations of interest rate cuts after better US inflation data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.1 percent at 39,753.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.9 percent to 5,584, while the Nasdaq fell 2.0 percent to 18,283, snapping a run of seven straight records on the tech-focused index.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While two of the three indices finished in negative territory due to weakness in Nvidia, Apple and other tech equities that have led the market in 2024, analysts noted that the majority of equities moved higher.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What's being bought is the laggards," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's the start of a healthy rotation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall consumer prices declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, US data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The better-than-expected reading comes as markets increasingly wager that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Futures markets now see around an 85 percent chance of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Delta fell 3.9 percent after reporting a 29 percent drop in quarterly profits to US$1.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carrier scored record revenues for the June quarter but said it would temper plans to add capacity in the second half of 2024 due to moderating demand. American Airlines and United Airlines also fell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tesla plunged 7.9 percent following a report that Elon Musk's electric auto giant will delay a much anticipated "robotaxi" event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unveiling was originally planned for August 8, but Tesla has pushed the event back until October to give teams more time, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the decision. (AFP)

 Czech 31st seed Barbora Krejcikova will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon final after battling back for a shock 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over former champion Elena Rybakina on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Just hours after Paolini beat tearful Croatian Donna Vekic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (10/8) in the longest ever women's semi-final at the All England Club, it was Krejcikova's turn to dig deep for victory against fourth seeded Rybakina in two hours and seven minutes on Centre Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova faces seventh seed Paolini on Saturday in what will be the second Grand Slam final of the 28-year-old's career after her French Open triumph in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so proud about my game and my fighting spirit today," said Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech started 2024 with a run to the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, but a first round exit at the French Open was a major setback.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She struggled with a back injury and illness, winning just three singles matches in the five months before finally finding her form in remarkable style at Wimbledon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Krejcikova shocked 11th seed Danielle Collins in the fourth round and former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in the quarter-finals, before turning her sights on Rybakina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-time Wimbledon doubles champion is now one win away from an unexpected triumph in the singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unbelievable. It is very tough to explain, but a lot of joy and a lot of emotions," Krejcikova said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I broke her in the second set, I started to be in the zone and I didn't want to leave the zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rybakina had been in formidable form, dropping just one set as she extended her impressive All England Club record to 19 wins from 21 matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2022, made a fast start with two quick breaks for an early 4-0 lead in a one-sided first set against Krejcikova.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first Wimbledon semi-final, Krejcikova turned the tide in the second set, landing a priceless break in the sixth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She levelled the match on her sixth set point, making it the first time in 20 years that both Wimbledon women's semi-finals had gone to the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Czech held all the momentum and she eventually wore down Rybakina, who had committed over 35 unforced errors by the time she surrendered her serve in the decisive, seventh game of the final set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini had never won a main draw match at Wimbledon before this year, but the world number seven tenaciously saw off Vekic in two hours and 51 minutes to secure a second successive Grand Slam final appearance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old, who lost the French Open final to Iga Swiatek last month, is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paolini, who also made the Australia Open last 16 in January, had not gone past the second round in any Slam before this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Without a win at the All England Club heading into the tournament, Paolini now has six victories under her belt and has dropped just two sets in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The last months have been crazy for me. It is a dream. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this Wimbledon," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You know there is no place better than here to fight for every ball and every point. I will remember this forever."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vekic paid the price for 57 unforced errors, with the semi-final fittingly ending on another wild forehand from the unseeded Croatian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unable to contain her frustration at letting 3-1 and 4-3 leads slip in the last set, Vekic broke down in tears in the closing stages of a rollercoaster clash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was crying because I had so much pain. I didn't know how I could keep playing," Vekic said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I thought I was going to die in the third set. I had so much pain in my arm, in my leg." (AFP)

    'The Shining' actor Shelley Duvall dies aged 75

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Director Stanley Kubrick put Duvall through the ringer to play the part of Wendy Torrance. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761242_1_20240712013345.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shelley Duvall, the versatile actor known for her role in "The Shining" and working relationship with director Robert Altman, died on Thursday aged 75.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citing her partner Dan Gilroy, The Hollywood Reporter said Duvall died in her sleep at her home in Blanco, Texas following complications of diabetes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Born July 7, 1949 in Fort Worth, Texas, Duvall was discovered by Altman – the maverick filmmaker known for his rich characters, sharp social criticism and keen satire – who cast her in 1970's dark comedy "Brewster McCloud."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The saucer-eyed actor developed a broad repertoire, breaking through with 1975's "Nashville," and going on to portray memorable and eccentric characters that earned her a smattering of awards including at Cannes for her role in the acclaimed 1977 drama "3 Women."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her career was defined by her work with Altman, who she said she kept working with because "he offers me damn good roles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "None of them have been alike," she told The New York Times in 1977.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He has a great confidence in me, and a trust and respect for me, and he doesn't put any restrictions on me or intimidate me, and I love him."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was her role in the film adaptation of Stephen King's "The Shining" that would become one of her highest profile roles, as she played opposite Jack Nicholson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Stanley Kubrick put her through the ringer to perform the part of Wendy Torrance in the horror classic that sees a writer husband descend into homicidal madness and terrorise his wife and young son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall told People in 1981 the 13-month job was gruelling, and that Kubrick had her "crying 12 hours a day for weeks on end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will never give that much again. If you want to get into pain and call it art, go ahead, but not with me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one famous scene Nicholson's character tortures Duvall's with a baseball bat, which reportedly took 127 takes to satisfy Kubrick.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Duvall also made a cameo in 1977's "Annie Hall" by Woody Allen, and played opposite Robin Williams in Altman's 1980 live-action rendition of "Popeye."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the 1980s she made her way into children's programming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gilroy – a musician who was part of the Breakfast Club and had dated Madonna – was her longtime partner after the pair met on the 1990 Disney Channel Movie "Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My dear, sweet, wonderful life partner and friend left us. Too much suffering lately, now she's free. Fly away, beautiful Shelley," The Hollywood Reporter quoted Gilroy as saying. (AFP)

    EU accepts Apple plan to let rivals access tap-to-pay

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Competitors will now be able to compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops in the EU. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761239_1_20240712004748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The EU on Thursday approved Apple's offer to allow rivals access to the iPhone's ability to tap-to-pay within the bloc, ending a lengthy probe and sparing it a heavy fine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case dates back to 2022 when Brussels first accused Apple of blocking rivals from its popular iPhone tap payment system in a breach of EU competition law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple has committed to allow rivals to access the 'tap and go' technology of iPhones. Today's decision makes Apple's commitments binding," EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From now on, competitors will be able to effectively compete with Apple Pay for mobile payments with the iPhone in shops. So consumers will have a wider range of safe and innovative mobile wallets to choose from," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU previously found that Apple enjoyed a dominant position by restricting access to "tap-as-you-go" chips or near-field communication (NFC), which allows devices to interconnect within a very short range, to favour its own system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now competitors will have access to the standard technology behind contactless payments to offer alternative tap-to-pay tools to iPhone users in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU but also Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only customers with an Apple ID registered in the EEA would be able to make use of these outside apps, the European Commission said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes must remain in force for 10 years and a "monitoring trustee" must be chosen by Apple to report to the commission during that period on their implementation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apple had risked a fine of up to 10 percent of its total worldwide annual turnover. Apple's total revenue in the year to September 2023 stood at US$383 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the EEA for users and developers, and will continue to provide an easy, secure and private way to pay, as well as present passes seamlessly from Apple Wallet," the company said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe's conclusion comes at a particularly difficult moment in relations between the EU and Apple, especially over the bloc's new competition rules for big tech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Digital Markets Act (DMA) seeks to ensure tech titans do not privilege their own services over rivals, but the iPhone maker says it puts users' privacy at risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the DMA's main objectives is to give consumers more choice in the web browsers, app marketplaces, search engines and other digital services they use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU in June accused Apple of breaching the DMA by preventing developers from freely pointing consumers to alternative channels for offers and content outside of its proprietary App Store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also kickstarted another probe under the DMA into Apple's new fees for app developers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company could face heavy fines if the DMA violations are confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, the EU slapped a 1.8-billion-euro (US$1.9 billion) fine on Apple in a different antitrust case but the company has appealed the penalty in an EU court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels also forced Apple last year to scrap its Lightning port on new iPhone models, in a change that was introduced worldwide and not just in Europe. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kenyan President William Ruto announced on Thursday the dismissal of almost his entire cabinet and consultations to form a "broad-based government" following widespread anti-government protests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the move affects all ministers including the attorney-general but excluded prime cabinet secretary and foreign minister Musalia Mudavadi and Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto said he decided on the dismissals "upon reflection, listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said and after a holistic appraisal of the performance of my cabinet and its achievements and challenges."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action follows largely peaceful protests led by young Gen-Z Kenyans that have widened into a broader campaign against Ruto and his government, with some demonstrations degenerating into deadly violence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ruto also said he will "immediately engage in extensive consultations across different sectors and political formations, with the aim of setting up a broad-based government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This government would, he said, help him to develop "radical programmes" to deal with the country's huge debt burden, increase job opportunities, eliminate government waste and "slay the dragon of corruption." (AFP)

    US consumer inflation eases more than expected

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Biden issued a statement saying the report shows the US is making significant progress in fighting inflation. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761230_1_20240711215505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US inflation cooled more than expected in June, government data showed on Thursday, a positive development for President Joe Biden as he fights to win confidence on his economic record in his reelection bid.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.0 percent last month from a year ago, said the Labour Department, as a drop in petrol prices more than offset housing costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices also saw the smallest annual rise since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today's report shows that we are making significant progress fighting inflation," Biden said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While costs of cars and appliances are falling, he conceded that prices remain too high and pledged to "do everything I can for the working people that built our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A consensus forecast of analysts initially expected consumer inflation at 3.1 percent, down from 3.3 percent in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy has been on a bumpy path to reining in inflation, which soared to a blistering 9.1 percent in mid-2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This prompted the central bank to rapidly hike interest rates in hopes of easing demand and bringing down price increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that there has since been "modest" progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In June, overall CPI declined 0.1 percent on-month for the first time since 2020, Labour Department data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "core" CPI index excluding the volatile food and energy was up 3.3 percent on-year, the smallest jump since April 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The improvement on the inflation front recently is good news for growth in real disposable income, which matters for consumer spending," said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that spending "hit a lull" in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest report adds to a series of encouraging data that could give officials confidence that inflation is coming down to their two-percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, in turn, would allow them to start cutting decades-high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The jobs market, another segment that Fed policymakers are monitoring, has also returned to a "strong, but not overheated" state, Powell said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A further deceleration in prices and labour market cooldown would "support a change in message from the Fed" at its July policy meeting, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This could open the door to rate cuts as soon as the September meeting, she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, said: "We still have a ways to go yet."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While shelter inflation has noticeably eased, he maintained that housing has been a major factor behind the stickiness of figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't see relief in the housing market for some period of time after the Fed starts to cut rates," he warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Fed starts cutting in September, it's going to be months and months before we see enough significant movement in the 30-year mortgage to make a difference," he said. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A documentary produced jointly by China Media Group (CMG) and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) will showcase the unique charm of Hong Kong's culinary culture to the world.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a launch ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the documentary "Taste of Hong Kong" is an important milestone as it is the first joint production of the two broadcasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said CMG's cooperation with RTHK has supported the SAR in various ways, including the donation of a number of high-quality programmes for RTHK for broadcast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cooperation has not only further enhanced Hong Kong people's understanding of the country, but also promoted the city's integration into the country's overall development, while promoting Chinese culture to the international community, Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Wang Xiaozhen, Vice President of CMG, said the group has fulfilled its duties and mission as part of state media by working closely with the Hong Kong government to tell the city's story, promote quality development and showcase the charm of Chinese culture. He said it has achieved a number of fruitful results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said he hoped the documentary will encourage more mainlanders to visit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that RTHK will play an active role by working closely with mainland broadcast media, while acting as a bridge for cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world.

    Ex-Indonesian minister gets 10 years in jail for graft

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesia’s anti-graft court sentenced a former agriculture minister to 10 years in prison on Thursday after finding him guilty of corruption-related extortion, abuse of power and bribery involving ministry contracts with private vendors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The case has tarnished President Joko Widodo’s credibility in fighting corruption. Five other members of Widodo’s cabinet had been sentenced to prison terms in corruption cases, casting a shadow over his efforts to clean up government before his term ends in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court in the capital, Jakarta, ruled that the former cabinet minister, Syahrul Yasin Limpo, was guilty of abusing his power by enriching himself and other officials. It also ordered him to pay a 300 million rupiah fine, and said he would be subject to another four months’ imprisonment if he fails to pay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The defendant has legally and convincingly been proven guilty of corruption,” presiding Judge Rianto Adam Pontoh said. “He wasn’t a good example as a public official, what he has done is counter the government’s efforts to fight corruption and enriched himself by corruption."
  <br/>
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A new survey showed that nursing and education were the most popular subject choices among this year's DSE candidates.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ninety percent of this year’s DSE candidates hoped to continue their education in Hong Kong, according to a survey conducted by the Quality People Resources Limited between November and January this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It polled 3,236 DSE takers from 41 secondary schools across Hong Kong, aiming to examine students’ preferences in continuing education and taking up employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company’s director Edward Chan on Thursday said students hoped to stay in the city mostly due to convenience and the fact that they view Hong Kong as their home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For local students, convenience, parent’s expectations, or scholarship, sponsorship, or Hong Kong is their home…[these are why they would prefer to stay in Hong Kong],” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four percent of candidates hoped to continue their education on the mainland, and six percent overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese University and Polytechnic University were the most popular choices among students, with 22.4 percent and 16.4 percent of students hoping to be admitted respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nursing was the most desirable subject among students at 13.5 percent, followed by education at 12.44 percent and psychology at 12.41 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This echoes with the most preferred job industry among students, with education at 16.4 percent and nursing at 13.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that students tend to select subjects according to their DSE results and personal interests, followed by industry trends related to their preferred majors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also saw an increase in preference in selecting Hong Kong as the future working location for graduates, with a rise from 76 percent last year to 81 percent this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that personal interests, at 58.9 percent of candidates, remained the top priority among students this year when choosing their career, followed by salary and benefits at 54.9 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The living cost in Hong Kong is very high. Students can see the high cost of rent, transport and food, therefore they will consider this first [when choosing their subjects]. Therefore students are indoctrinated with the thought that they will need to acquire a certain salary level to live in Hong Kong,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said it would consider the increase of university tuition fees starting from the 2025/26 academic year for their survey next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 50,800 DSE candidates will receive their exam results next Wednesday.

    Police to use Chinese pistols instead of US revolvers
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they were replacing US-made revolvers with pistols manufactured on the mainland to meet their operational needs, with officers expected to use the new handguns as soon as July 25.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two Chinese-made pistols, CF98-A and CS/LP5, will replace existing service revolvers from the US firm Smith & Wesson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of officers to receive training includes those from the tactical unit, emergency unit, quick reaction force and crime wing headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have our established procurement procedures. To review the police uniform, accoutrement, as well as equipment, is a regular [task] that the police force has been doing," said superintendent Ko Cheuk-hang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To choose a good equipment we rely on a couple of very important principles, first of all the effectiveness and the long-term sustainability. And apart of this major principle, we need to make sure all these equipment could serve the purpose as well as meet our weapon handling standard requirement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the new pistol is equipped with a manual safety catch and can be reloaded faster compared with the existing revolvers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ko added the force would be trained to use the new handguns in phases, but did not comment on the timeline for a full transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Vickers, the CEO of risk consultancy Steve Vickers and Associates, told RTHK that the move to replace the handguns was not unexpected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not surprising given that the old Smith & Wesson revolvers are no longer being manufactured, and it's actually quite difficult to get spare parts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously the US-China relations are pretty poor. There have already been restrictions on both the Americans and the EU countries supplying weapons to the Hong Kong police. So it made sense to, for both historical reasons and practical reasons and political reasons, to move to a PRC-manufactured firearm."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former senior police officer added that the transition could take years, depending on the delivery and training schedules.

    Legco passes child abuse reporting law
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco passes child abuse reporting law" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761185_1_20240711163026.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it will work on finding additional care places for abused children, as more cases are expected to come to light in the city thanks to a new law passed by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill sets out how 25 types of professionals, including doctors, social workers and teachers, will face a maximum punishment of three months in prison and a HK$50,000 fine if they fail to tell the authorities when they suspect a child is suffering physical, psychological or sexual abuse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill was introduced last year following a series of abuse scandals which sparked calls for more protection for children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seventy-nine lawmakers voted in favour of the new law, with no opposing votes and one abstention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said the legislation will come into effect 18 months after it is gazetted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're going to make use of the coming 18 months to make sure that everything is ready so that by the time the legislation comes into effect, all the professions who are required under the law to make mandatory reporting will get the necessary training," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're also at the same time putting in place additional facilities and homes to cater for the increasing cases of reporting. And also, we're going to step up our efforts in terms of promotion and publicity, and make sure that we all work together for the welfare and betterment of our children.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Thursday's debate on the bill, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien proposed a higher maximum punishment of one year in prison for those who fail to report abuse suspicions, saying the three-month term doesn't reflect the seriousness of such an offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Did you ask the children’s thoughts? Did you only ask the professionals’ thoughts? We have one million children in Hong Kong. I think we won’t have one million professionals,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tien also argued that the courts rarely hand out the maximum sentence possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said the penalty level is the same as for other mandatory reporting laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These include the reporting of drug trafficking, terrorism, and organised crime. The government believes the deterrent effect of the penalty is already sufficient and appropriate to the crimes involved,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, meanwhile, lauded the government for adding more exemptions and immunity clauses in the bill, as well as for forming consultant groups to create a “report manual”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said these moves had addressed concerns raised by professionals regarding the bill.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A rower who waded deep into the Atlantic Ocean has said he had a close encounter with more than 1,000 whales, which swam alongside him for hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  UK-based Tom Waddington, who was 100 nautical miles (185km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, also captured the stunning encounter on Sunday on video as he rowed solo to raise money for charity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The images he captured showed the whales swimming around his boat, rocking it as they passed. He expressed both awe and worry during the breathtaking moment at sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I love it, but I'm scared they're going to hit my rudder. They're so close, I can hear them. They're blowing bubbles," he said in the video.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't believe it. It's an amazing sight, but also so scary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rower on his Instagram said he tried to row away from the huge pod of whales, but they followed him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the end, they swam alongside him for two hours and eventually left him alone, he said, adding he was safe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mr Waddington is undertaking a 2,000 nautical miles journey to raise funds for mental health. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick on Thursday called on the government to limit the number of online ride-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In documents submitted to the legislature earlier this week, officials said they plan to regulate online ride-hailing services through a licensing system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Yick said the authorities should issue a licence to only one or two platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of these online car-hailing platforms available in Hong Kong. Now if you look around the other cities in the world, some of them have already controlled the number of these kinds of platforms available for the citizens to use," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of having a limited number of platforms, because the possibility of matching the services will be much better than if you split into a multi-number of these kinds of platforms. I think this is a very simple concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yick also said that the drivers of private vehicles offering ride-hailing services through such platforms should obtain a licence, otherwise they and their passengers would not be covered by insurance.

    High-potential swimmers won't be hindered: Ronnie Wong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Hong Kong China Swimming Association, Ronnie Wong, on Thursday said the association would give special consideration to high-potential young swimmers to participate in races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came amid calls to revise the rules for competition qualifications over accusations that some swimmers had been discriminated against due to the club they belonged to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local media reported that a nine-year-old was denied entry to compete at the 2024 open championships in Hong Kong due to the ranking of his swimming club, despite the swimmer meeting the qualifying time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Wong said the association would not hinder swimmers with potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to take care of a lot of clubs. Under some special circumstances if the swimmers are really outstanding, but the clubs they belong to are not qualified for open race, we will consider allowing the swimmers to compete. But this is only on an individual consideration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New People's Party lawmaker Adrian Ho told the same radio programme that the association should remove higher-ranked clubs, that have been inactive for two or three years, from affiliation, allowing lower-ranked clubs to move up and take their place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because according to the current rules of the swimming association, if a club does not cancel its affiliation, there will be no room for lower-ranked clubs to advance. If there are clubs which don't have any activity, and remain in the same position, there is no chance for lower-ranked clubs to advance," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said the association should enhance transparency by disclosing the number of inactive clubs and ensure fair handling of club rankings.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday warned Nato against "provoking confrontation" over its ties with Russia, after the alliance accused it of playing a key role in helping Moscow's assault on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said a declaration from Nato leaders from their Washington summit was full of "belligerent rhetoric" and the China-related content has provocations and lies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nato statement claimed that China had "become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine", and that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed Beijing's "so-called 'no limits' partnership" and "large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base" were of "profound concern".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said: "Nato should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is known to all that China is not the creator [of] the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war, but did not get into specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also repeatedly hit out at Nato criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top officials of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, in attendance at Nato, have forged stronger ties with the security alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said: "We firmly oppose Nato acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Colombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Uruguay's Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia went down to 10 men just before half-time when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. (Reuters)

    England overcome Netherlands to advance to Euro final

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ollie Watkins struck a stunning injury-time winner as England beat the Netherlands 2-1 on Wednesday to set up a Euro 2024 final showdown with Spain in Berlin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an incredible finish to an evening that began badly for England, as Xavi Simons gave the Netherlands an early lead in the semi-final in Dortmund.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, England were soon level through a Harry Kane penalty following a contentious VAR call by German referee Felix Zwayer, and the match looked set for extra time until Watkins struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On for Kane, Watkins received a pass from fellow substitute Cole Palmer with his back to goal in the first minute of stoppage time, turned and fired low into the far corner to leave the Netherlands bewildered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm lost for words really," said Watkins, the Aston Villa striker. "I don't think I've hit a ball that sweet before, and obviously in such a special moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has rarely been a convincing campaign from Gareth Southgate's England side, but they are through to their second consecutive European Championship final as they dream of finally winning a first major trophy since 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To do that they will surely have to perform better than at any point so far in Germany as they face an outstanding Spain team, who beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands had been hoping to repeat their triumph at the last Euros in Germany, in 1988, but their current side lacks anyone with the star quality of Marco van Basten or Ruud Gullit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A victory for them would have seen this Euros conclude with the same final as the 2010 World Cup. Instead they now go home. (AFP)

    Clooney urges Biden to end 2024 bid

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Joe Biden is hosting the Nato summit in Washington this week. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761092_1_20240711014558.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden suffered a stunning blow on Wednesday when actor and leading Democratic supporter George Clooney urged him to drop his reelection bid, while party heavyweight Nancy Pelosi declined to back his candidacy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I love Joe Biden," Clooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden just last month, wrote in the New York Times. "But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Former House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run," she told MSNBC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after Nato's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden dropped in on US union leaders in a further bid to shore up backing for his reelection bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's appearances at the Nato gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot – and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House," Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House "has done nothing" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Republican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's the biggest cover-up in political history," Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The three major indices on Wall Street all gained on Wednesday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761098_1_20240711043449.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered higher on Wednesday with major indices finishing up more than one percent, hitting fresh records amid rising expectations for upcoming interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at all-time highs following comments from US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank would not wait until inflation hit two percent before considering a rate cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Treasury bond yields retreated, with analysts citing strong demand at a 10-year Treasury note auction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones gained 1.1 percent to 38,921.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.0 percent to 5,633 for its sixth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2 percent to 18,647 to end at its seventh straight record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell's remarks came in congressional testimony before a House panel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said. "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo said the rally was notable one day before the market sees key new US consumer price data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Powell is basically telegraphing to the market that we are having a rate cut in September," Cardillo said. "That's what's behind the move here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Microsoft advanced 1.5 percent as the tech giant informed regulators that it will not take a non-voting position on the board of OpenAI amid scrutiny of its influence over the groundbreaking ChatGPT maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Honeywell International gained 1.9 percent after announcing that it purchased Air Products' liquefied natural gas process technology and equipment business for US$1.8 billion. Air Products advanced 0.4 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advanced Micro Devices won 3.9 percent as it announced plans to acquire Silo AI, the largest private artificial intelligence lab in Europe, for about US$665 million. (AFP)

    Twelve children killed in S Africa school minibus fire

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761091_1_20240711014937.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Twelve children were killed in South Africa on Wednesday when a minibus taking them to school near Johannesburg overturned and burst into flames after being hit by another vehicle, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver of the minibus was also killed and seven other children were rushed to hospital, according to officials in Johannesburg's Gauteng province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Television images showed that the minibus was totally destroyed by the fire in the early morning crash in Merafong, more than 70 kilometres west of the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charred schoolbook pages were scattered on the tarmac, as police examined the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A private scholar transport minibus was involved in a tragic accident in the Kokosi-Wedela area in Merafong, claiming the lives of the 12 learners and their driver," the Gauteng government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could not immediately give the ages of the children but said most were from a primary school, where students are normally aged between six and 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They were burnt beyond recognition. When this happens forensics will have to do their part in terms of identification," said Gauteng traffic police department spokesman Sello Maremane.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were investigating what happened but it appeared that the minibus was struck from behind by a small pick-up truck, causing it to overturn and catch fire, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver of the pick-up was also in hospital, reports said. By late afternoon, most of the children in hospital had been released, reports said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am profoundly saddened by this tragic event," Gauteng education minister Matome Chiloane said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Africa has one of the most developed road networks on the continent but also has one of the worst road safety records, in part due to reckless driving and unroadworthy vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have always said to parents we need to check the condition of the vehicles that we put our kids in," Chiloane said at the scene of the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many South African parents have to rely on private minibuses to get their children to school. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) on Wednesday formally named a star-studded 592-member team for this month's Olympic Games in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US squad, which is comprised of 314 female athletes and 278 male athletes, will be aiming to top the Olympic medal table for a fourth straight games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team includes Olympic stars such as gymnast Simone Biles, swimmer Katie Ledecky and NBA icon LeBron James.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is with immense pride and excitement that we announce the 2024 US Olympic Team and the exceptional athletes that embody the spirit of dedication, resilience, and excellence, continuing the proud history of Team USA at the Olympic Games," USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US team includes more than 250 returning Olympians, including three five-time Olympians, four four-time Olympians and 16 three-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The squad includes 122 Olympic medallists, including 66 Olympic champions who boast a combined 110 gold medals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forty-five athletes on the team have won multiple Olympic medals, while 23 have won multiple Olympic golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The youngest member of the team is gymnast Hezly Rivera, who turned 16 on June 4, while the oldest member of the squad is equestrian Steffen Peters, the 59-year-old German-born rider who first represented the United States at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US central bank will not want to wait for inflation to cool to its two percent target before considering a rate cut, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We've said that you don't want to wait until inflation gets all the way down to two percent, because inflation has a certain momentum," Powell said in testimony to the US House Financial Services Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you waited that long, you've probably waited too long," he added. In such a scenario, inflation would go well below the target level – which is also an undesirable outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Powell was responding to a question on whether the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, would need to dip below two percent at least once in the coming months before officials contemplate rate reductions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank leader's comments come a day after he noted recent inflation readings have shown "modest" progress, adding that "more good data" would boost confidence that price increases are cooling sustainably.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To combat surging inflation, the Fed in recent years hiked the benchmark lending rate to a decades-high level in hopes of easing demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, policymakers have held rates at a 23-year high. While inflation has peaked, its downward progress has stalled somewhat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Powell told lawmakers that he is not yet prepared to express confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to two percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the Fed's political independence, Powell added that this is critical to the central bank's ability to do its job and sustain the faith of people across the political spectrum. (AFP)

    Musetti through to semi-final, Djokovic gets free pass

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Musetti celebrates after winning his quarter-final match against Taylor Fritz. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761090_2_20240711081337.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lorenzo Musetti threw his head back and spread his arms wide to celebrate reaching his first Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon, then covered his face with both hands.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 25th-seeded Musetti, a 22-year-old from Italy, never had made it past the third round at the All England Club – or past the fourth round at any major tournament – until this fortnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He defeated 13th-seeded American Taylor Fritz 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now, though, comes a far tougher test – taking on Novak Djokovic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djokovic earlier progressed to a record-equalling 13th Wimbledon semi-final without hitting a ball on Wednesday after Alex de Minaur pulled out injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian ninth seed De Minaur, 25, announced shortly after midday at the All England Club that he was "devastated to pull out due to a hip injury."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It means Djokovic has now equalled Roger Federer's men's record of 13 semi-final appearances at Wimbledon as he closes on the Swiss great's mark of eight singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 37-year-old Serbian is also through to a record-extending 49th men's Grand Slam semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  De Minaur, who beat Djokovic at the United Cup in January, said: "It's no secret that this would have been the biggest match of my career but it's a unique injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I woke up this morning wanting to feel some sort of miracle, but there was a high risk of making the injury worse if I stepped on court. One stretch, one slide could take this from a three to six weeks' injury to four months out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a historic 25th Grand Slam triumph is coming into sharp focus for Djokovic, who demolished Holger Rune in straight sets in the fourth round on Tuesday. (AP/AFP)

    Israeli army orders evacuation of war-torn Gaza City

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Deadly Israeli air strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761088_1_20240710235703.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel's army dropped thousands of leaflets over war-torn Gaza City on Wednesday urging all residents to flee a heavy offensive through the main city of the besieged Palestinian territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaflets, addressed to "everyone in Gaza City," set out designated escape routes and warned that the urban area, which had a pre-war population of over half a million, would "remain a dangerous combat zone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning came as Israeli troops, backed by tanks and aircraft, have fought Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the heaviest combat the city has seen in months in the war raging since October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one operation, the army said it had killed militants and found weapons inside the long-vacated Gaza City headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere across Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, sparking rebukes from France and Germany which both labelled the attacks "unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We call for these strikes to be fully investigated," said the French foreign ministry, highlighting a deadly strike on Tuesday on a school near the southern city of Khan Younis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is unacceptable that schools, especially those housing civilians displaced by the fighting, should be targeted."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy fighting also raged in Gaza's far-southern Rafah, where witnesses said that Israeli tanks had rumbled into the city centre and unleashed intense fire on buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest fighting in Gaza has newly displaced 350,000 civilians, said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, who spoke before the leaflet drop and said "there is absolutely no safe space in Gaza."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One woman carrying her scant belongings through the ruins, Nimr al-Jamal, said that "this is the 12th time" her family has had to flee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How many times can we endure this? A thousand times? Where will we end up?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The upsurge in fighting, bombardment and displacement came as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal to end the war now grinding on into its 10th month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Doha, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of their sensitivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile met US President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Netanyahu "emphasised his commitment" to a proposed truce plan, "as long as Israel's red lines are preserved," his office said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hawkish premier has repeatedly insisted that the war goals are to defeat Hamas and bring home all hostages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prime minister's office said "14,000 terrorists have been eliminated" since the beginning of the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Yoav Gallant separately told parliament that 60 percent of Hamas fighters had been "eliminated or wounded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The security establishment, and myself heading it, are determined to achieve the goals of the war and complete them," Gallant said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli army said it was reviewing the Khan Younis area attack on Tuesday in which hospital sources said at least 29 people were killed in a school used as a displacement shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaza's Hamas government said a "majority" of the dead were women and children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed the wounded being rushed to the nearby Nasser hospital, many screaming in pain, as relatives wailed in grief for the dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One wounded man, Osama Abu Daqqa, recounted that "suddenly the strike hit, people were injured and martyred and there was no one to help them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another survivor, Mohamed Sukkar, said those hit in the strike "were not part of the resistance nor were they armed, they were all civilians."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military said a strike had hit near the school building and had targeted and killed a Hamas "terrorist" who had taken part in the October 7 attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was "looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al Awda school," which it acknowledged was "near the location of the strike."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The incident is under review."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three previous strikes since Saturday on Gaza schools used by displaced Palestinians have killed a total of at least 20 people, said Gaza officials and rescue services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lazzarini wrote on social media platform X that "schools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,295 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has also imposed a punishing siege on Gaza's 2.4 million people, eased only by sporadic aid deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aid group Doctors Without Borders has warned of "critical" shortages of medical supplies in Gaza, with no resupply for more than two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Independent UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a "targeted starvation campaign," a claim strongly rejected by Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Army spokesman David Baruch on Wednesday said that "the food is getting there, maybe not as much as everyone would want, but I don't see starvation." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 UK police were searching on Wednesday for a suspect who may have a crossbow after the wife and two daughters of a BBC radio racing commentator were killed in a suspected "targeted" attack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kyle Clifford, 26, from north London, is wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BBC confirmed on its news website that the victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, aged 25 and 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local police said officers were called to a house in the town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said armed officers and specialist search teams were involved in the manhunt, urging Clifford to contact police and warning the public not to approach him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simpson called it "a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths "truly shocking" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning," she said. "It's really sad what's happened, very shocking."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC on Wednesday said it was investigating suspected corruption involving frontline staff from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the case relates to procurement projects under HK$50,000 at public hospitals and possible violations of section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eight people were arrested. They have since been released pending further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC added that more than 10 others were interviewed under caution, among them EMSD staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the EMSD said it will fully cooperate with the investigation and will not tolerate any illegal acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to section 4 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, government officers must not solicit or accept any advantage as an inducement or reward.

    Legco passes bill to bring in non-HK trained dentists

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council on Wednesday passed legislation allowing non-locally trained dentists to practise in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dentists Registration (Amendment) Bill also requires local dentistry graduates to intern at specified institutions for a year before registration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the bill's debate in Legco, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau called it a "historic moment" for the city's dental profession.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the most comprehensive amendment to the Dentists Registration Ordinance in Hong Kong in over 60 years," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added that the Department of Health will start hiring non-locally trained dentists and aims to have the first batch arrive here in the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said there's a shortage of dentists in Hong Kong, with the shortfall expected to persist until 2040 before easing slightly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also reiterated that the one-year internship requirement has nothing to do with a shortage of dentists in the public sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if the Department of Health achieves zero vacancy through local and non-local recruitment in future, the government will undertake to arrange internships for all local dental graduates to enhance their skills. This will not be affected by manpower supply or demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The internship arrangement will apply to local dental students graduating in the summer of 2025 and onwards.

    'Surveillance cameras needed to enhance taxi services'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ryan Wong (third left, front row), who chairs the Taxi Council, said there is room for improvement in taxi services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Taxi Council and lawmakers on Wednesday called on the government to make installing surveillance cameras inside taxis mandatory to enhance service quality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hang Seng University conducted a survey involving around 1,200 passengers, including both local residents and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's findings revealed that 57 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with the city’s taxi services, showing a slight uptick from 55 percent last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK after a press briefing at the Legislative Council, Ryan Wong, who chairs the taxi council, said there was room for improvement in taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We suggest the government consider it mandatory to install a central cloud-based camera system on taxis in order to monitor the driver's behaviour as well as to prevent illegal acts. And this is also supported by the general public, according to the survey result in this round," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Ben Chan, who chairs Legco’s transport panel, and transport sector lawmaker Frankie Yick, also expressed their support for the mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in taxis, citing similar measures already in place on the mainland and in Macau.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

    New sweatsuit helps remove sweat faster: researchers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Polytechnic University say they have developed a new type of smart sweatsuit that helps athletes remove sweat faster.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "iActive" garment has a small device dubbed "artificial sweat glands” installed on the back. It uses low-voltage electricity to collect sweat and move it away from the body.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Shou Dahua, who led the research, said the device is safe to wear as it only has a low voltage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the idea for the sweatsuit came from how trees transport water through their roots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We collect the water via the root-like structure, and then we dissipate sweat on the bottom area using a low, safe voltage… The sweat dissipation rate is three times faster than the maximum human sweating rate,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition, our sportswear is 60 percent lighter and 50 percent less clingy when soaked, in comparison to conventional sportswear.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides athletes, the garment would also be suitable for outdoor workers, medical professionals and firefighters, Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sweatsuit can also be controlled by a smartphone app, allowing people to adjust the speed of sweat removal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The research team said it has conducted various tests to ensure safety, finding that the sweat removal function doesn't deteriorate over time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Let's say after 500 laundry tests or after 100 hours of continuous use, the difference of sweat dissipation rate is quite small, less than five percent,” Shou said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the team is in talks with different sports brands to commercialise the product and aims to price it at HK$800 per garment.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local companies were planning to allocate, on average, 4.3 percent of their annual budget towards employee training and development -- the highest percentage since 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was one of the findings from a survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management which polled 108 companies across 20 industries with over 65,000 full-time employees between March and May this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Banking and financial services topped actual spending on employee training at 6.2 percent, followed by the manufacturing sector at 5.8 percent and the hospitality sector at 4.2 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Average annual training hours per employee in 2023 remained similar to 2022 at 17.3 hours, with 76 percent of companies using webinars or virtual classrooms for training and development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey found companies were looking to strengthen employees’ interpersonal and customer service skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “From the macro environment, there’s an urgent need to enhance customer service to attract customers, to retain customers because customer service is one of the core committed edge to outperform the competitors,” said the institute's chairman of learning and development committee Chester Tsang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding artificial intelligence (AI) usage, 77 percent of the surveyed companies allowed the use of AI, with 28 percent of employers providing relevant tools to their employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute suggested companies implement measures to boost employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates as the city faced a talent shortage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include providing advancement opportunities, identifying and nurturing potential successors, and providing relevant training programmes to employees to bridge skill gaps.

    Appointments underway for new mainland travel permit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In-person appointments began on Wednesday at China Travel Service centres across Hong Kong for people applying for new mainland travel permits.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The card allows permanent residents who are not Chinese citizens to travel to the mainland for up to 90 days at a time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man named Johan arrived early at one travel centre on Hong Kong Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just to make it easier to go to China because so far, I've had to apply for a visa, and the visa process is quite time-consuming, so this just makes things a lot easier," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ambos said he travels to the mainland for work several times a week and the new permit will make his trips easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I work with factories in China so every week I'm in [mainland] China two or three or four days. It's a great place to go buy products for different markets of the world. It's got good pricing and good-quality products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now the rest of my company are all locals...and this card just makes it easier to go in and out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Manna told RTHK she needed to make another appointment as she was missing a document from the Immigration Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The applying process is really easy actually, it's just an online submission. But I didn't know that I needed to get something from Tseung Kwan O [immigration office], that approval letter. So I have to go back and get it, and then actually I have to make another appointment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that was not clear for me, because they said to get the documents, but I didn't get what the document was... But it's okay, three of my family members will be applying, so I can give the message to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Hart said he found the centre to be busy, but said that was understandable given it was the first day of appointments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea on Wednesday said it would extend a three-day strike indefinitely in a bid to force management to negotiate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The strike is the biggest labour action in the tech giant's history and steps up pressure on the chipmaker's management, who last week predicted a huge second-quarter operating profit increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(We) declare a second indefinite general strike from July 10, after learning that the management has no willingness to talk," the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 5,000 members stopped working Monday for what was meant to be a three-day strike, part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce. (AFP)

 Mainland customs officers have caught a man at a border crossing point between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with over 100 live snakes stuffed in his trousers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news of the reptilian round-up was announced by China Customs on its official WeChat account on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers at the Futian boundary control point recently stopped the man, who was passing through the checkpoint without making any declarations, for an inspection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found 104 live snakes in six sealed drawstring bags that were in the man's pockets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were five types of reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, with most of them being introduced species.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government was actively pursuing membership in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a summit organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Lee said the SAR could contribute to the regional economy by becoming a RCEP member.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can offer RCEP member enterprises a wider range of high-quality service options, including supply chain management services, and financial and professional services," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will assist them to better connect and leverage the limitless opportunities brought by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, promoting economic development and innovation in the RCEP member countries and the overall region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the current government administration had been seeking support from RCEP members by making overseas visits to regions such as the Middle East and ASEAN countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong offered a safe and convenient business environment for mainland companies to expand globally, and for foreign companies to enter the mainland market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi was on target as 2022 world champions Argentina turned on the style to beat Canada 2-0 on Tuesday and reach the Copa America final where they will look for a third straight major title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-times Copa champions produced their best display of the tournament in front of a capacity crowd at the 82,500 MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Argentina soaked up some early pressure before Julian Alvarez ghosted in between two defenders to open the scoring with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Messi had chances throughout the match and doubled the lead in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The truth is that it's crazy what this group has done, what the Argentina national team has been doing," Messi told TyC Sports after his first goal of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's not easy for us to be in a final again, for us to compete again to be champions. I'm living it like I lived it in the last Copa America, in the last World Cup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are the last battles and I'm enjoying them to the maximum," said the 37-year-old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defending Copa champions will face the winners of Wednesday's semi-final between Uruguay and Colombia in what will be a highly anticipated final in Miami on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada, who surprised many by reaching the last four in their first Copa America appearance, can take great credit for their run in the tournament but Messi and company were simply a step too far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the tournament caught up with us a little bit," said Canada's American coach Marsch, who said he noticed that his players looked tired midway through the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eventually the physicality and fatigue can catch up with you and that was a big part of what happened with us tonight," he added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index rose just over 90 points, or about 0.5 percent, at the opening on Wednesday to trade at around 17,613.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that the US is "no longer an overheated economy," remarks that suggested the case for rate cuts is strengthening. Some investors had anticipated the Fed chair, in his testimony to a Senate banking panel, might do more than he did to telegraph that a cut was on track for the central bank's September meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index opened down 0.35 percent at 2,949. The Component Index in Shenzhen also opened lower, falling 0.39 percent to 8,672 points in early trading. (with additional reporting from Reuters and Xinhua)

 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)
