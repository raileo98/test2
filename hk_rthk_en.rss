<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey continues to showcase strong in-season form through the 2024 season. In the 200m freestyle in Barcelona she took down the late Camille Muffat‘s Mare Nostrum Tour record, which had stood since 2008. Haughey clocked 1:54.57 for the win, undercutting Muffat’s record by .09 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey split 26.99/28.78/29.08/29.72 for the win and the new record. She is already ranked 3rd in the world this season behind Mollie O’Callaghan and Summer McIntosh with her 1:5408 from the Budapest stop of the World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She won the race by more than three seconds, with Valentine Valerie Dumont the closest swimmer to her in 1:57.92. Dumont’s season best stands at 1:57.57 from back in February but this was another solid in-season swim from her and the 4th fastest of her career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey had to settle for silver in the women’s 50 freestyle, as Sweden’s Michelle Coleman eked out the win, out-touching her by .03 seconds. Coleman earned the win in 24.61, improving on her season best time from the 2024 World Championships (24.65).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her first race of the session, Haughey swam 24.64. That’s the 4th fastest swim of her career and her fastest in 2024. Her 2023-24 season best is a 24.62 from the U.S Open.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenia’s Neža Klančar earned 3rd place in 24.83. Like Haughey, it’s her fastest swim in 2024 as it betters the 24.87 mark that she swam in Doha. In December, she swam her personal best of 24.70. (SwimSwam)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:40 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had been issued at 3:25 am, and heavy rain was expected to fall generally over Hong Kong, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory had warned that there might be flooding in some low-lying and poorly drained areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who were likely to be affected were advised to take all necessary precautions to reduce their exposure to risk posed by the heavy rain and flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People should stay alert to the danger that may be brought about by river flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said people should stay away from watercourses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day mainly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P both rising after April data for the Fed's favoured inflation measure broadly matched expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The moves came after Commerce Department data showed that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, largely unchanged from March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones closed up 1.5 percent at 38,686, while the S&P 500 ended the day 0.8 percent higher at 5,277.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nasdaq was the only major New York index that did not rise on Friday, closing almost unchanged at 16,735.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're on track for a positive month," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones said before the closing bell, adding that there was often "a bit of rebalancing" at the end of the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Who knows, maybe on Monday that could easily be reversed," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual firms, tech firm Dell Technologies tumbled 17.9 percent despite beating earnings expectations, with some analysts pointing to a lower-than-expected backlog for artificial intelligence servers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the apparel company Gap saw its shares surge 28.6 percent after beating earnings expectations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory says the Strong Wind Signal No 3 will remain in force until at least noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast track, Tropical Cyclone Maliksi will move towards the vicinity of Qingyuan. It will skirt at around 200 kilometres to the northwest of Hong Kong around noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maliksi will continue to bring strong southerly winds and heavy squally showers to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary before noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds on high ground will be occasionally gale-force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory says the need to issue the Standby Signal No 1 thereafter depends on the degree of weakening of Maliksi over inland areas and the changes in local wind conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that seas will be rough with swells and members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Strong Wind Signal No 3 is still in force, classes of kindergartens, schools for children with physical disability and schools for children with intellectual disability are suspended today.

    Questioning Trump guilty verdict 'dangerous': Biden

    <![CDATA[<img alt='"If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone," Donald Trump said in an unscripted 33-minute speech at Trump Tower. Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755634_1_20240601025801.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that it was "dangerous" for people to question the integrity of the guilty verdict in Donald Trump's hush money jury trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his first public comments since a New York jury on Thursday found Trump guilty on 34 counts over a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election, Biden, a Democrat, struck out hard at Trump and other Republicans who have criticised the verdict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Donald Trump was given every opportunity to defend himself." Biden said. He noted that the case against Trump in New York was brought by the state, that it was not a federal case, and that the verdict was delivered by "a jury of 12 citizens, 12 Americans, 12 people like you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US justice system has endured for nearly 250 years, Biden said, and he criticised Trump and his supporters for attempting to tear it down with false allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's reckless, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible for anyone to say this was rigged just because they don't like the verdict," Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In rambling remarks earlier on Friday at the Trump Tower lobby in Manhattan, Trump repeated his complaints that the trial was an attempt to hobble his comeback White House bid and said it showed that no American was safe from politically motivated prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they can do this to me, they can do this to anyone," Trump said in an unscripted 33-minute speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's guilty verdict catapults the United States into unexplored territory ahead of the November 5 vote, when Trump, 77, will try to win back the White House from Biden, 81. (Reuters)

    Biden says Israel offers new roadmap to end Gaza war

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The US president has urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755636_1_20240601031825.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden said on Friday that Israel was offering a new roadmap towards a full ceasefire in Gaza that he urged Hamas to accept, saying it's "time for this war to end."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden's intervention, which had been heavily trailed, came as Israeli troops pushed into central Rafah, escalating its nearly eight-month war with Hamas despite international objections to any assault on the south Gaza city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came as top diplomat Antony Blinken acknowledged that despite US efforts to get more aid into Gaza, the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory remained "dire."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his first major address outlining how the Gaza war might end, Biden said that Israel's three-stage offer would begin with a six-week phase that would see Israeli forces withdraw from all populated areas of Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also see the "release of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded, in exchange for (the) release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel and the Palestinians would then negotiate during those six weeks for a lasting ceasefire – but the truce would continue while the talks remained underway, Biden said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US president urged Hamas to accept the Israeli offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's time for this war to end, for the day after to begin," he said, adding: "We can't lose this moment" to seize the chance for peace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After successive rounds of indirect negotiations in recent months all failed, Hamas said earlier on Friday that it had informed mediators it would only agree a "comprehensive" truce including a hostage-prisoner swap if Israel halts its "aggression."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's Qatar-based political office, accused Israel of "using negotiations as a cover to continue its aggression," saying Hamas "refuses to be a part of these manoeuvres."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has repeatedly vowed to destroy Hamas since the Palestinian militant group attacked southern Israel on October 7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel sent tanks and troops into Rafah in early May, ignoring concerns over the safety of displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in the city on the Egyptian border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, soldiers were operating in the city centre where they uncovered rocket launchers and tunnel shafts and dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility, the army said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A stream of civilians has flooded out of Rafah, taking their belongings on their shoulders, in cars or on donkey-drawn carts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Rafah offensive began, the United Nations said up to 1.4 million people were sheltering in the city. Since then, one million have fled the area, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli seizure of the Rafah crossing has further slowed sporadic deliveries of aid for Gaza's 2.4 million people and effectively shuttered the territory's main exit point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel said at the weekend that aid deliveries had been stepped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Food Programme said daily life had become "apocalyptic" in parts of southern Gaza since Israel began its assault on Rafah in early May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agency was able to provide "ever decreasing amounts of assistance," with all of its bakeries in Rafah closed due to a lack of fuel and supplies, its director for the Palestinian territories, Matthew Hollingworth, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jordan announced it will host a summit on June 11, jointly organised with Egypt and the United Nations, bringing together aid agency chiefs and heads of donor governments to discuss the humanitarian response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on Israeli official figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas released a video on Telegram on Friday featuring the audio of a woman's voice, who they said was one of the hostages. The audio file could not immediately be verified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,284 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Representatives of the ANC follow live voting results at the Independent Electoral Commission. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755632_1_20240601022857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on track on Friday to score its worst electoral result ever, with the latest tallies showing voters deserted the party in droves and ended its 30-year political dominance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The African National Congress (ANC) is now all but certain to fall below 50 percent of the vote, forcing the party to seek a coalition partner to have enough backing to name a president and form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This marks an historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, as the party has enjoyed an absolute parliamentary majority since 1994, when its then leader Nelson Mandela led the nation out of white minority rule and into democracy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With more than two thirds of the votes cast in Wednesday's general election counted, the ANC remained in the lead but with a score below 42 percent, compared to the 57 percent it won in 2019 and far off the 62 percent secured by Mandela in 1994.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As votes continued to be validated, data from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) showed the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) held second place with 22.64 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it was not a surge by the DA that cut into the ANC's vote share.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In third place was former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) on 12 percent, a surprise score for a party founded barely six months ago as a vehicle for the former ANC chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected at the weekend, but with the trends clear and the votes stacking up on the IEC website, politicians and pundits were turning their attention to the prospects of an ANC-led coalition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party, but if the latest, President Cyril Ramaphosa, is to remain at the helm he will have to decide whether to seek allies on his right or his left.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be resistance within his movement to a tie-up with the second-placed DA, under white politician John Steenhuisen, whose pro-free market programme of privatisation and an end to black economic empowerment programmes is at odds with the ruling party's traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there will also be reluctance to invite Zuma, who left government facing a raft of corruption allegations, or firebrand Julius Malema's radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) into government after both fought bitter campaigns against their former party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC retains the loyalty of many voters for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some experts expect the party to patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups, especially as the Zuma's MK has stormed to victory in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The MK has really eaten into the ANC's vote," said Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others, like analyst and author Susan Booysen, said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma – who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018 – was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might instead prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But another outside observer, political analyst and business leader Sandile Swana, argued that Ramaphosa's authority had take such a beating in the election that he would not be able to push reluctant party bigwigs to accept a DA alliance. "His power is gone within the ANC," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappe's highly anticipated move to Spanish champions Real Madrid will be made official early next week, a source close to the negotiations said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The captain of the French national team, who will be available on June 30 when his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, has decided to sign for Real after seven seasons in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His entourage did not immediately respond to enquiries about the rumour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the move is announced as expected on Monday or Tuesday, Mbappe is unlikely, according to several media outlets, to be presented in the Spanish capital before the end of Euro 2024, which runs from June 14 to July 14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the moment, he is expected to remain with the France team which has been in camp in Clairefontaine since Wednesday ahead of two Euro warm-up matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They face Luxembourg in Metz on Wednesday and Canada in Bordeaux four days later. (AFP)

    Blinken says Gaza situation 'dire' despite aid efforts

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken acknowledged on Friday that the humanitarian situation was "dire" in Gaza as Israel pushes in deeper, despite US efforts to bring in more assistance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken spoke a day after USAID chief Samantha Power quoted aid workers as saying that the "conditions are worse now than ever before" in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The humanitarian situation remains dire for people in Gaza," Blinken told reporters in Prague when asked about Power's remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've seen changes – some positive changes – but the net effect is not there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken added that while the number of aid trucks entering Gaza was up "significantly," distribution remained difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed to the impact of Israeli military operations around the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah and the closure of the Rafah border into Egypt after Israel seized control of the crossing from the Hamas militant group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're not just measuring inputs, we're measuring impact. And yes, the impact remains insufficient in terms of addressing the acute needs of children, women and men in Gaza," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has pursued military operations in Rafah despite a warning from President Joe Biden, though the White House says the assault is smaller than the type of massive operation which he had called unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United States has built a temporary pier into Gaza at a cost of at least US$320 million, but it was damaged in poor weather, suspending deliveries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Gaza war broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,189 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally of official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,2844 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to data provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

    US Fed's favoured inflation measure remains unchanged

    <![CDATA[<img alt='New York Fed president John Williams says he expects inflation will "resume moderating in the second half of this year." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755624_1_20240531232750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve's favoured measure of inflation remained unchanged in April, according to government data published on Friday, as services prices remained elevated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news will likely lead the US central bank to keep interest rates elevated throughout the summer, as it balances a desire to start easing monetary policy with the need to keep inflation falling towards its long-term two percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in April, the Commerce Department said in a statement, while monthly inflation increased by 0.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These figures were in line with the median forecast in a survey of economists conducted by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, and came in at the same level as it did in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After falling for much of last year, inflation accelerated again at the start of 2024, reducing the likelihood of early rate cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High rates also complicate US President Joe Biden's reelection message as he seeks to convince still-sceptical consumers that the economy is heading in the right direction ahead of November's vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, services sector inflation drove much of the increase, rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent – slightly lower than a month earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stripping out volatile food and energy prices – both of which continued to rise last month – the closely watched "core" measure of inflation rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in April, in line with expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This suggests that underlying inflation remains elevated, a fact which could keep the Fed on pause for longer than previously anticipated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, New York Fed president John Williams, who is a permanent voting member of the US central bank's rate-setting committee, said he expected inflation would "resume moderating in the second half of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at all the data, I don't feel any urgency or need to make a decision now," he told an event in New York, adding that things were going in the "right direction."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data published on Friday also show that personal income eased to 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department said, down slightly from 0.5 percent in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Personal savings as a percentage of disposable income came in at 3.6 percent in last month, in line with the revised figure from March. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

    'Unlikely the Republican Party will abandon Trump'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Brian Wong says Donald Trump retains strong support from his party. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755610_1_20240531203313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political scholar on Friday said it was unlikely the Republican Party would abandon Donald Trump as its presumptive presidential nominee.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former president was convicted in an historic criminal case of falsifying business records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, said Trump retains strong support from his party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said that Trump's conviction may affect independent voters in swing states, but he didn't think it would benefit his challenger, President Joe Biden, a great deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no reason to think that Trump is therefore ineligible. And that's because the US Constitution has only three requirements when it comes to eligibility for candidacy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One, the candidate must be at least 35 years old. Secondly, they must be a natural born US citizen. And thirdly, they must have lived in the US for at least 14 years. There's no stipulation that they must not have a criminal record. So this will not affect his nominal and technical eligibility to run as a candidate should the Republican National Convention decide that is indeed to be the case."

 Police said a woman arrested on Wednesday is suspected of committing the offence of “providing pecuniary or other financial assistance or property for the commission of secession by other persons” under the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said their investigation revealed the woman had provided HK$140,000 to fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman was one of seven people arrested this week on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, which include former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were linked to suspected seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 4.40pm, and added it would remain in force until at least 6am on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming said the chance of issuing a higher signal is rather low, unless Tropical Storm Maliksi rapidly intensifies or tracks closer to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Maliksi would make landfall in the western part of Guangdong around midnight tonight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of 5pm, Maliksi was estimated to be about 290 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong. It is forecast to be slow-moving at first, and then move northwards later at about 15 kilometres per hour, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we look at the radar imageries, we can see that the squally showers and strong winds associated with Maliksi are gradually affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary. Local winds will strengthen progressively."

    Hong Kong retail sales fall in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The value of total retail sales for April dropped nearly 15 percent compared with the same month in 2023. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755577_1_20240531170816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday condemned criticisms made by the United States, Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, as well as foreign media over the recent subversion trial involving 47 defendants, calling them groundless.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned "primary election" organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the court had carefully considered the law, evidence and arguments presented by the prosecution and defence during the 118-day trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said the verdict clearly stated the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR, which is established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such illegal acts, which endanger national security, have nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 47 people were charged in the case. With the exception of two individuals, for whom there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the court that they were involved in the conspiracy, all 45 others were convicted, demonstrating the scale and seriousness of the conspiracy. The Department of Justice has informed the court of its intention to appeal against the acquittal of the two defendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government demanded that the US and other Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, and foreign media stop spreading false reports and malicious attacks on the court's ruling in this case.

 The Department of Health warned people on Friday not to fall for fraudulent advertisements circulating online about free medical insurance by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health authorities said in a statement that false advertisements carrying the department's logo claimed the government would provide medical insurance for people aged 55 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they have reported the case to police, adding that all remarks in those advertisements are false.

 The Observatory said the strong wind signal No. 3 will be issued at 4.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A tropical depression over the northern part of the South China Sea is forecast to move north, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said according to the present forecast track, it will make landfall in western Guangdong from Friday evening to early Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said while the tropical depression is expected to move across inland of western Guangdong, the associated rainbands will still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 3.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standby signal No 1 has been in force since 5.40pm on Thursday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese and American defence chiefs held talks in Singapore on Friday, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Dong Jun met with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between the defence chiefs of the two countries since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong and Austin began the talks at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of China-US relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides agreed after a summit between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks. That includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea. (Agencies)

    Licensed taxi fleet investment 'could top HK$100mn'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licence applications for taxi fleets ended on Friday, with an industry representative saying his group would invest more than HK$100 million in a squad of cabs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The licensed taxi fleet system is part of wider efforts to improve the service quality of point-to-point transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the government, fleets operating in urban areas should have 300 to 1,000 taxis each, whereas those in the New Territories should have 100 to 350 cabs each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And participating taxis must not be in use for more than three years when a licence is offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities are expected to issue a maximum of five licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yue-ting, from the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, said he believes around eight applications were submitted before the noon deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Wong said he and 12 other operators have joined hands in applying for a licence in the New Territories, in hopes of improving cab services there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the group would have to invest at least HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I estimate that, for the first six months, we would invest HK$3 million to HK$5 million in a taxi-hailing service, plus dash cameras and other systems in the vehicles," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the vehicles, we'll mostly have to replace the existing ones because many of them would have been in use for more than three years when they are licensed. I think more than 80 percent of the taxis no longer fit the requirement. Each taxi will cost about HK$400,000, which means an expenditure of HK$100 million to replace some 300 vehicles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said he submitted an application for a fleet of about 400 taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said mainland ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Gaode had contacted him on proposing to work together.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dallas Mavericks, fueled by 36 points each from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, routed the Minnesota Timberwolves 124-103 on Thursday to clinch the Western Conference crown and book an NBA title showdown with the Boston Celtics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Denied a sweep at home on Tuesday, the Mavs left no room for doubt in Minneapolis as they wrapped up the best-of-seven conference finals 4-1 to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since they won the title in 2011.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Celtics will host game one of the championship series on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Slovenian star Doncic and Irving had their way with the league's top-rated defense, Doncic taking the game by the throat in the opening minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He scored four of his six three-pointers in the first period, including a bomb from the center court logo, and the Mavs closed the quarter on a 17-1 scoring run to put the Timberwolves on their heels for good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irving got going with 15 points in the second quarter as he and Doncic combined for 44 first-half points – four more than the Timberwolves put on the board before halftime, when the Mavs led 69-40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points each for Minnesota, Towns adding 12 rebounds for the third-seed Timberwolves, who had swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round and stunned the defending champion Denver Nuggets in seven games in the second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Timberwolves had been 3-0 in elimination games this post-season, with wins in games six and seven against the Nuggets as well as their victory on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the early damage by Doncic and Dallas' disruptive defense put this one out of reach early and the Mavs grabbed the first double-digit victory of a hard-fought series.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says it will halt tariff concessions from June 15 for some Taiwan products that currently enjoy preferential tariff rates stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), in response to the island's trade restrictions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement was made on Friday by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The special rates will be removed from 134 goods, including machine tools and industrial chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China in December suspended tariff concessions for some products under the ECFA, but the Finance Ministry said the island has not reciprocated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Taiwan region has unilaterally adopted discriminatory measures such as prohibiting and restricting the export of mainland products, which violates the provisions of the (agreement)," the ministry said. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The court ruling on a subversion trial showed that national security risks exist in Hong Kong, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, three national security judges convicted 14 people of conspiring to commit subversion, relating to an opposition plot to take control of the Legislative Council to disrupt government operations. Prosecutors also announced their intention to appeal against the acquittal of two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said people have to read the court verdict carefully and safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the government will take action against anti-China behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The court ruling reflects that national security risks in Hong Kong truly exist. It's not like what some people said that they were just chanting some slogans and advocating for freedom. Their goal was to destroy Hong Kong, disrupt Hong Kong's constitutional order, paralyse the Hong Kong government, and on a deeper level, use Hong Kong as a base to inhibit the country's development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one fighting for democracy and freedom would hope to paralyse the government or have the streets filled with petrol bombs, Chan said.

 The Observatory on Friday said it would issue the strong wind signal number three between 4pm and 6pm, as a tropical depression moves north towards the coast of western Guangdong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the cyclone would make landfall tonight, or early tomorrow morning, before moving inland, and that Hong Kong would see heavy showers on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong boxer Ruru Yang became WIBA Super Bantamweight champion on Thursday, defeating Thailand's Tanwarat Saengiamjit in Bangkok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old won by unanimous decision after 10 rounds in the Thai capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She adds the previously-vacant WIBA Super Bantamweight belt to her WBC Asia Super Flyweight crown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang went into the bout with an undefeated record in five professional fights, with two wins coming by way of TKO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saengiamjit, with a record of nine wins and one loss, had already failed at a shot at the super bantamweight title in 2015 –  when she lost to New Zealand's Gentiane Lupi
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang is now undefeated in six fights since turning professional in 2022.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Should Donald Trump win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755463_1_20240531051916.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A New York jury convicted Donald Trump on all charges in his hush money case on Thursday in a seismic development barely five months ahead of the election where he seeks to recapture the White House.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The historic first criminal trial of a former US president ended with the 77-year-old Trump found guilty on each of the 34 charges of falsifying business records to hide a payment meant to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump, who is all but certain to appeal, did not immediately react, but sat still, his shoulders dipping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The conviction thrusts the United States into uncharted political territory but does not bar Trump from a White House run, even in the unlikely event that Judge Juan Merchan sentences him to prison time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict comes just weeks before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where Trump is due to receive the party's formal nomination to face Democratic President Joe Biden on November 5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 12-member jury deliberated for more than 11 hours over two days at the end of the extraordinary five-week trial held in a drab Manhattan courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump was convicted of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a US$130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels on the eve of the 2016 election, when her claim to have had sex with him could have proved politically fatal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial featured lengthy testimony from the adult performer, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who described to the court in graphic detail what she says was a 2006 sexual encounter with the married Trump.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prosecutors successfully laid out a case alleging that the hush money and the illegal covering up of the payment was part of a broader crime to prevent voters from knowing about Trump's behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump's defence attorneys had countered that "trying to influence an election" was simply "democracy" and that the former president did nothing wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial has distracted Trump from his campaign to unseat Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he milked the media attention throughout, with daily speeches in front of the cameras outside the courtroom in which he complained about being a political victim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Identities of the 12 jurors deciding the case were kept secret, a rare practice more often see in cases involving mafia or other violent defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After teasing the prospect for weeks, Trump – who denied ever having sex with Daniels at a 2006 celebrity golf tournament – opted not to testify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Republican, who made his name as a brash real estate mogul before a stunning ascent to the nation's highest office in the 2016 election, now faces prison or, more likely, probation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In theory, he could face up to four years in jail for each count of falsifying business records but legal experts said as a first-time offender he is unlikely to go behind bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An appeal could take months to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Should he win the presidency he will not be able to pardon himself, given that the case was not brought by the federal government but by the state of New York, where only the governor could clear his name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trump also faces federal and state charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, and for hoarding secret documents after leaving the White House. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell for a second straight session on Thursday following a downgrade in a US growth report as several large tech shares tumbled.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world's biggest economy expanded at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the January to March period, the Commerce Department said, below the 1.6 percent figure published last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Dow member Salesforce plunged nearly 20 percent as the technology company published mixed results and lowered some of its full-year projections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other large tech companies followed Salesforce lower. Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon all fell 1.5 percent or more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.9 percent at 38,111.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to 5,235, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 1.1 percent to 16,737.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The losses came on the heels of Wednesday's session in which major indices retreated amid worries that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high due to persistent inflation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all about interest rates. We don't see any relief in sight from the Fed," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "There is a growing view that they won't cut at all this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy soared 13.4 percent despite reporting a 6.1 percent drop in comparable sales as investors were encouraged by commentary suggesting an improvement in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Kohl's plunged 22.9 percent after results missed expectations. The retailer reported a loss of US$27 million. (AFP)

    ANC on track to lose majority after South Africa vote

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Cyril Ramaphosa was all smiles after casting his ballot at a polling station in Soweto. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755457_1_20240531031603.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa's ruling ANC was on course to lose its 30-year-old parliamentary majority on Thursday, opening the prospect that the party that defeated apartheid will have to share power for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With a third of votes in Wednesday's election tallied, the ANC was leading but with a score of only 42 percent – well below the 57 percent it won in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Followed by the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) on 25 percent. The leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and former South African president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) were neck and neck on around nine percent each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final results are expected in the next three days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The broad church of the ANC has taken a substantial knock. This is a shock to the system for the ANC and ultimately will also be a shock to the system for the average South African, who has only known ANC rule since 1994," said political analyst Daniel Silke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It redraws the political boundaries of South Africa and creates a degree of uncertainty."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If President Cyril Ramaphosa's party is confirmed as dropping below 50 percent, it would force him to seek coalition partners to be re-elected to form a new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would be a historic evolution in the country's democratic journey, which was underlined by newspaper headlines on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SA on the cusp of shift in politics," read the front page of daily BusinessDay. "The people have spoken," headlined The Citizen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC has dominated South Africa's democracy with an unbroken run of five presidents from the party.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party remains respected for its leading role in overthrowing white minority rule, and its progressive social welfare and black economic empowerment policies are credited by supporters with helping millions of black families out of poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But over three decades of almost unchallenged rule, its leadership has been implicated in a series of large-scale corruption scandals, while the continent's most industrialised economy has languished and crime and unemployment figures have hit record highs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people in power are hopefully going to come down and we will have a new political party," Shaun Manyoni, a 21-year-old student, said in Johannesburg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ramaphosa's opponents from both the left and the right came to the polls on Wednesday hoping either to replace the ANC with an opposition alliance or force the party to negotiate a coalition agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Zuma ran this country perfectly ... so let's put him back and let South Africa run again," said Don Naidoo, a middle-aged small business owner from the province's largest city of Durban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Voting was marked by hours-long queues in many districts, which in some cases forced polls to remain open well beyond closing time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said a last-minute rush in urban voting and high turnout were to blame for the late finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost all votes had been counted by 3:00 pm on Thursday, but most had yet to be validated, IEC's head Sy Mamabolo told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While, the process was "proceeding well," officials said they expected it would take longer than the usual 24 hours to reach an 80 percent tally, due to delays caused by the new three-ballot system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the ANC gets close to 50 percent it could shore up a majority by allying itself with some of the four dozen smaller and regional parties contesting the election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But this appeared increasingly unlikely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Experts were split on who the ANC would prefer as bedfellows and on whether the poor performance threatened Ramaphosa's leadership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His power is gone within the ANC," said analyst Sandile Swana, predicting that the party would patch up ties with one or both of the radical left groups led by former ANC figures: firebrand Julius Malema's EFF or Zuma's MK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a major upset, the latter was leading with 43 percent of preferences in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, a key electoral battleground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor from the University of Johannesburg said MK was a natural partner for the ANC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have similar policies and similar tendencies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analyst and author Susan Booysen said the rift between Ramaphosa and Zuma, who has long been bitter about the way he was forced out of office in 2018, was "too far reaching" to mend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ANC might prefer the centre-right DA, which pledged to "rescue South Africa" through better governance, free market reforms and privatisations, to the leftist EFF, which is perceived as "too erratic" and "unpredictable" in its demands, she added. (AFP)

 Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna has ended speculation about his immediate future by signing a new four-year contract on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McKenna, 38, led the Portman Road club to a second successive promotion last season as Ipswich returned to the Premier League.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That achievement saw him linked with the managerial vacancies at English top-flight rivals Brighton, Chelsea and Manchester United.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am extremely proud to have signed a new contract with the club," McKenna told Ipswich's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have enjoyed incredible success together over the last two seasons and I'm excited to have the opportunity and responsibility of leading this fantastic club into its first season in the Premier League in 22 years." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="All three main indexes were lower in New York at midday. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755452_1_20240531004342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets diverged on Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation indicators that could determine the future direction of interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  All the main indexes were lower in New York at midday, following on to Wednesday's slump when shares were hit by concerns that interest rates will not be coming down any time soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US shares were also hit by Salesforce slumping 21 percent after the software company reported disappointing results the previous day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US Treasury yields fell back after figures pointed to a slightly weakening US economy, though they were just off their recent highs, indicating expectations of higher-for-longer interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thursday's second update to first quarter GDP data showed it grew an annually adjusted 1.3 percent, slower than the initial estimate of 1.6 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Traders awaited Friday's release of the crucial personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, hoping for signs that prices are being brought under control enough for rates to be cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though Treasury yields eased this morning from yesterday's four-week highs, the market appears anxious heading into PCE," said Joe Mazzola, a strategist at Charles Schwab.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rising yields snuffed out the tech-led stock market rally yesterday even before Salesforce missed quarterly revenue expectations and sank double-digits," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Friday also sees the release of the latest eurozone consumer price index, a key release ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting on June 6 and which could decide whether the central bank goes ahead and as expected cuts rates by 25 basis points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe's main stock markets closed higher on Thursday, making up some of the losses from the previous session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere on Thursday, the Sydney stock market closed lower with shares in BHP shedding 1.7 percent after the Australian mining giant ended its US$49-billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, whose shares were down five percent in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oil prices fell ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting over concerns about future demand in China and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Oil is on track for its second straight day of falling prices amid softer US growth data ahead of Sunday's Opec+ meeting," said Axel Rudolph, Senior Market Analyst at IG. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's parliament gave the final green light to a controversial amnesty bill for Catalan separatists on Thursday, paving the way for the return of their figurehead Carles Puigdemont after years of self-imposed exile.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The legislation seeks to draw a line under years of efforts to prosecute those involved in the botched 2017 Catalan independence bid that triggered Spain's worst political crisis in decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The text, which has been resolutely opposed by Spain's right and far-right opposition, passed by 177 votes in favour to 172 votes against in the 350-seat parliament. One person was absent from the vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing the amnesty is a key moment for Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as it was a demand made by separatist parties in exchange for their parliamentary support to allow him to serve a new term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In March, Spain's lower house of parliament passed the bill, which grants an amnesty to hundreds of separatists involved in Catalonia's failed 2017 independence bid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It then went to the Senate upper house, which is dominated by the right-wing opposition, where it was symbolically vetoed – as the Senate cannot block a bill, but only propose amendments – before returning to the lower house on Thursday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following a rowdy two-and-a-half hour debate during which the Speaker was forced to call order several times due to the insults traded on the floor, the bill passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will now be up to individual judges to decide whether the amnesty applies to their cases. They have two months to raise issues with the Constitutional Court or the European justice system which could delay the law's implementation for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest beneficiary will be Puigdemont – the former Catalan leader who led the bid then fled Spain to avoid prosecution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His hardline separatist JxCat and its moderate rival ERC both demanded the amnesty in return for their votes in November that let Sanchez secure another four-year term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What opened that door was Spain's inconclusive July 2023 election, which was won by the right-wing Popular Party (PP) but without enough parliamentary support to form a government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With JxCat cast as kingmaker, Sanchez won them over with the promise of an amnesty and returned to office, in a move sparking fierce and unrelenting opposition from the PP and the far-right Vox.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have drawn thousands onto the streets in mass protests against the bill that at times turned violent, notably around the Socialists' Madrid headquarters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this week, a PP spokesman said that even after it passes, the party would do everything to "overturn" the law, whether through appeals to the Constitutional Court or "social pressure" on the street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Surveys suggest Spaniards are divided over the amnesty, even Sanchez's own Socialists and their supporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the outcome of Catalonia's regional election on May 12, in which the Socialists won a clear victory, has shifted the picture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The separatists lost their absolute majority in the Catalan parliament after 10 years in power, suggesting the focus has shifted away from independence, vindicating Sanchez's strategy of seeking to defuse tensions around the 2017 crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The leader of the Socialist Party's Catalan branch, Salvador Illa, is hoping to lead the region's new government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The results show that Catalonia has chosen "the path of forgiveness, giving up any kind of resentment," Sanchez said in Barcelona last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Puigdemont, whose party increased support during the vote and has said he wants to lead a minority separatist administration, is hoping to be home back in time to see a new Catalan government take office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the date has not yet been set, it is expected to take place by June 25 at the latest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it is unclear whether that will be possible, given the two month time span for the courts to enact the legislation, which involves releasing those behind bars and cancelling outstanding arrest warrants, including the one for Puigdemont. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull has purchased a minority stake in Leeds United and will become the English second-tier football club's main shirt sponsor next season, it was announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The global drinks brand, best known in sport as the backer of the world champion Formula One team, are already involved with football clubs RB Leipzig, Red Bull Salzburg and New York Red Bulls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am thrilled that Red Bull is joining us to build a bright future for Leeds United and shares our deep respect for this truly special club," said United chairman Paraag Marathe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As chairman, our consortium of investment partners will be invaluable to me as we approach this important moment for the club, now and into the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Red Bull's addition is a historic milestone that will further empower the club to reach its full competitive potential."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leeds will spend a second consecutive season back in the Championship after losing to Southampton in last Sunday's play-off final at Wembley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull chief executive of corporate projects and investments Oliver Mintzlaff said the company hoped to help the Yorkshire club back into the top flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ambition to bring Leeds United back to the Premier League and establish themselves in the best football league in the world fits very well with Red Bull." (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and his wife Roh So-young. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755442_1_20240530224208.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of South Korea's sprawling SK Group was ordered by a court on Thursday to pay his wife US$1 billion in cash in the country's largest divorce settlement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court ordered Chey Tae-won to pay Roh So-young, the daughter of former president Roh Tae-woo, 1.38 trillion won as a settlement, court documents showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount was a significant increase from an earlier lower court ruling of 66.5 billion won and takes into account the contributions Roh So-young and her father made to Chey's success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SK Group runs businesses that include South Korea's leading mobile carrier and also controls SK Hynix, the world's second-largest memory chip maker.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was reasonable to rule that, as his wife, Roh played a role in increasing the value of SK Group and Chey's business activity," the court said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey married Roh So-young in 1988 but they have been separated for years. She appealed against the original settlement amount awarded in 2022, several years after Chey filed for divorce in what has become an acrimonious case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said the new settlement also took into account the emotional suffering Roh So-young endured due to Chey's extramarital affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey has a child with his new partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court said Chey "is not showing any signs of remorse for his foul behaviour in the course of the trial... nor respect for monogamy," ordering him to pay the settlement in cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's net wealth was assessed by the court to be around four trillion won, meaning Roh So-young will take 35 percent of it in the settlement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His legal team said they would lodge an appeal against the latest ruling, claiming the court had "taken Roh's one-sided claim as factual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Seoul High Court said Roh Tae-woo also helped Chey's business flourish during his five years as president from 1988, easing regulatory hurdles for SK's late former chairman Chey Jong-hyon, Chey Tae-won's father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Former president Roh Tae-woo played the role of a protective shield for ex-chairman Chey Jong-hyon" when the late businessman was trying to tap into the mobile carrier business, the court said, giving "intangible help" to the family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chey's lawyers disagreed, saying SK Group had been under pressure from the Roh government and had "provided various financial contributions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set things straight through the appeal," they said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former general, Roh Tae-woo was elected to the presidency in 1987 polls that were South Korea's first free and fair election in more than a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier helped his military academy friend Chun Doo-hwan stage a military coup and take over as a dictator. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Thursday said it strongly disapproves of, and condemns all baseless allegations by the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and the European Union (EU) against the city’s homegrown national security law as well as law enforcement action taken by the police’s National Security Department.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The police made seven arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seven were accused of being responsible for seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CECC and EU had described the arrests as a violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a statement published on Thursday, authorities said their claims simply do not stand up to the facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation,” the statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Offences in connection with seditious intention are very serious crimes, and no jurisdictions, including the US and those from the EU, will watch with folded arms acts and activities that endanger national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security, adding that it will not hinder legitimate expression of opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against acts and activities endangering national security. Only invaders who want to intrude into our home to plunder and loot should be worried by the Ordinance,” the statement added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the court ruling on a national security trial confirmed there was a conspiracy to commit subversion, which also showed the seriousness of the case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Lee said the judgement handed down by a three-judge panel showed there was a conspiracy to subvert state power and to destroy and overthrow the existing political system and structure established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the convictions of 45 of the 47 defendants showed the scale and severity of the plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 16 who pleaded not guilty, 14 were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion and two were acquitted. Thirty-one others pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that the Department of Justice had indicated its intention to appeal against the acquittals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR is duty-bound to safeguard national security, and is determined to fight any acts that compromise this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the subversion saga had harmed Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no winner out of this case. This is a very sad story that some Hong Kong people tried to conduct subversion of Hong Kong. I think it is good that we were able to interdict the plot so that the Hong Kong citizens will not suffer and Hong Kong will now resume to a normal state," he told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 and said it would remain in effect until at least 6am on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a tropical cyclone located about 800 kilometres from Hong Kong could affect the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad area of low pressure in the South China Sea has become a tropical depression, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said strong winds were not expected to have a significant impact on the region yet, but the tropical depression could move closer to the coast and strengthen slightly during Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would assess the need to issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 based on the storm's intensity, as well as local wind conditions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Thursday announced its intention to appeal against the acquittal of two of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were among 16 defendants who pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a verdict delivered on Thursday morning, the judges said they were not sure if Lau and Lee had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the lunch break, Director of Public Prosecutions Maggie Yang told the court that the Department of Justice intends to appeal using the amended Criminal Procedure Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She requested that the pair be kept on bail, pending a decision on the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee's defence counsel argued against that, saying his client should be a "free man" unless the court grants the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-judge panel decided to extend the bail of Lau and Lee. They are now required to report to police on a monthly basis, instead of twice every week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also said mitigation hearings for those convicted are scheduled for June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the media, chief superintendent Steve Li from the police's National Security Department welcomed the conviction of 14 defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the judgement, you can see that the court regarded this as a very serious case. This is a very illicit plot... The ultimate goal is to paralyse the government," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Iran opened a five-day registration period on Thursday for hopefuls wanting to run in the June 28 presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash earlier this month with seven others.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The election comes as Iran grapples with the aftermath of the May 19 crash, as well as heightened tensions with Israel and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The period would see those between the ages of 40 to 75 with at least a master's degree register as potential candidates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All candidates ultimately must be approved by Iran's 12-member Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and jurists ultimately overseen by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That panel has never accepted a woman nor anyone calling for radical change within the country's governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is unlear who will run. The country’s acting president, Mohammad Mokhber, a previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat, could be a front-runner, because he's already been seen meeting with Khamenei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also discussed as possible aspirants are former hard-line President Mohammad Ahmadinejad and former reformist President Mohammad Khatami.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day registration period will close on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guardian Council is expected to issue its final list of candidates within 10 days afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will allow for a shortened two-week campaign before the vote in late June. (AP)

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 at 5.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea will soon develop into a tropical depression. It is expected to gradually move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory added that there will be squally showers and thunderstorms in the coming days, while winds offshore and on high ground will strengthen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with Wifi [and a] charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

    Judges cite intention in acquitting two defendants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to respond to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two. Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

    FS hopes for stronger ties between China, US bay areas

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean military officials on Thursday said North Korea fired a barrage of suspected ballistic missiles toward its eastern sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The missile launch comes days after its attempt to put a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit ended in failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the North firing around 10 projectiles that appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles from an area near its capital, Pyongyang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the suspected missiles flew around 350 kilometres before landing in waters off the North’s eastern coast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the South Korean military had increased surveillance and shared its information with the United States and Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan’s coast guard issued a maritime safety advisory over the North Korean launches

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced that China would host the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026, adding it would be another milestone in Beijing's relations with the Middle East region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the announcement as he delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi also called for a peace conference on the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as he addressed Arab leaders and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is this week hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and several other Arab leaders for a forum at which discussions on the war in Gaza were expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the delegations, Xi said China supported a "broad-based" peace conference to resolve the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is a land bestowed with broad prospects for development, but the war is still raging on it," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "War should not continue indefinitely. Justice should not be absent forever," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict was handed down by three national security judges in a hearing at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

    Robots help with spine surgery at Queen Mary Hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Over the past eight months, robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at the hospital. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755312_1_20240530094044.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

    Prosecutors drop assault charges against Scheffler

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Prosecutors in Kentucky on Wednesday dropped all charges against top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler, who was arrested after allegedly ignoring police at a traffic stop outside the US PGA Championship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scheffler, 27, was handcuffed and led away by officers in the pre-dawn incident on May 17, before having his mugshot taken in an orange jumpsuit and then returning from jail to the Valhalla course and teeing off for his second round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler allegedly drove onto a curb near the course entrance after police set up a traffic stop due to a separate road accident in which a local man working at the tournament had been killed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police report said Scheffler had disobeyed orders to stop his car and accelerated, dragging to the ground police officer Bryan Gillis, who was hospitalized with bruising and swelling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Jefferson County Attorney Mike O'Connell lodged a motion in court to dismiss all charges against Scheffler and the judge agreed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court that the evidence against Scheffler did not meet the standard of probable cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on the totality of the evidence my office cannot move forward in the prosecution of the charges filed against Mr Scheffler," O'Connell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scheffler had been charged with felony assault on a police officer, criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from an officer directing traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His lawyer Steve Romines denied any wrongdoing, adding Scheffler was driving a marked player's vehicle when he received conflicting signals from police officers at the traffic control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Romines had stressed that his client would fight the charges and was "not interested in any sort of settlement negotiations or anything."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the morning of his arrest, world number-one Scheffler released a statement saying "there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Connell told the court in Louisville that Scheffler's claim of misunderstanding "is corroborated by the evidence." (AFP)
