<div class="itemFullText">
 Industry representatives on Monday expressed mixed feelings about business sentiment during the Olympics, despite seeing a boost in foot traffic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK that he expects bar takings to surge as much as 10 percent during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people might feel in the mood to spend after fencer Vivian Kong won a gold medal, but their elation wouldn't last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If they're happier, then they will be in a better mood to either buy retail or if they're in a bar with friends watching the Olympics, normally it's conducive to spending some money. I'd say if anything, it'll be maybe a 10 percent [sales increase] at best, but it's not going to be a huge game changer,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zeman said he doesn't believe the Games will persuade people to keep spending more in the long-run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Unfortunately, once the Games finish, then I think people will go back to normal,” he said, adding that the key to bringing back a “vibrant nightlife scene in the city” relies on hosting more international events to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties’ leasing department said the apm mall in Kwun Tong, which is showing the Games, saw an increase in foot traffic of at least 10 percent over Saturday and Sunday, compared to the previous weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fund told an RTHK programme that she believes the public became more engaged with the Olympics from the Tokyo Games, when they enjoyed watching the events together in malls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that he saw a surge in customers at restaurants with televisions on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects a 15 to 20 percent overall increase in business during the Olympics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said his administration has been focusing its attention on economic development and that business is a "win-win" situation for all, as he met with Lao officials as part of his third trip to Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee is leading a delegation to Laos, the first stop of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee met Laos' deputy prime minister and foreign minister Saleumxay Kommasith, witnessing the signing of a number of memoranda of understanding between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that business is always a win-win situation for the people of both places, and I have been focusing the whole government and society's energy and attention on strengthening economic development and business," Lee said during the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of my visit to Laos on this occasion is, first of all, to strengthen ties between government and government, and of course, strengthen ties between business and business, and also very importantly, strengthen ties between people and people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith, for his part, pointed to a new action plan signed by President Xi Jinping and General-Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Thongloun Sisoulith last year, saying it will be a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith also said the country is committed to working with the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a good opportunity for me and the [Lao People's Democratic Republic], both the government as well as the business community, to discuss and find a way to further expand economic trade cooperation in the [Lao People's Democratic Republic] and Hong Kong," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three women and two men have been arrested over the suspected murder of a 33-year-old man in Jordan, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man was found unconscious on Pilkem Street on Sunday morning and was later declared dead after being taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they think the alleged attack, which happened after the man left a suspected illegal gambling den at around 2am, could have been linked to a personal dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Commander Ching Chi-yan said the force suspects the victim was struck multiple times about the head with a hammer, adding that cracks were found in the back of the man's skull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, 40, and a woman, 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other women and a man, aged between 34 and 56, were suspected of assisting an offender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five were being held in detention as police continued their investigation.

    Home prices drop to lowest since September 2016

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Private flat prices in June fell about 1.2 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763645_1_20240729120033.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's home prices have fallen to their lowest level in almost eight years, with analysts predicting a further slump in the property market due to high interest rates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Monday showed that private flat prices fell about 1.2 percent in June, pulling the official index down from 305.6 in May to 301.8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prices also dropped for the second straight month, plunging to their lowest since September 2016.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Martin Wong, senior director and head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said high interest rates and the inventory of unsold units will continue to affect the city's property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We still expect the prices to go down a little bit in the second half of the year. But the price drop will be narrowed, because people are expecting the US to cut the rates later this year, and it will increase the market confidence for some of the buyers... Across the whole year, the price drop will be about five percent," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rents rose nearly 0.2 percent month-on-month in June to the highest level in four and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said he expects rents to continue to go up steadily, saying levels are being boosted by the arrival of overseas students and people moving to Hong Kong under talent admission schemes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencer Vivian Kong will inspire young people to follow their dreams and take up sport as a career, according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, took Hong Kong's third ever Olympics gold when she won the individual women's épée in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the world number one is helping to promote sports development by raising the profile and popularity of fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think fencing as an Olympic sport has to get established among young people... It (Kong's victory) can encourage more people, especially young people, to engage in physical activity and eventually to improve their overall physical and mental health as well," he said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong pulled out of the Asian Championships quarter-finals last month due to a knee injury, and underwent surgery for torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the fencer was lucky to be able to return to elite level after the injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sports medicine and literature indicates that maybe around 60 to 70 percent of the athletes can return to elite level," he said, adding that full credit for her recovery must go to her medical team for their "very good strategic rehabilitation plan".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some elite players, or maybe like soccer players, if you have an ACL injury, you may end your football career," Louie noted.

       Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun advanced to the quarter-finals of the men's single sculls by finishing second in his repechage.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds. The quarter-finals take place on Tuesday.

        Hong Kong's skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Olympic races. The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Edna O'Brien, the radical Irish writer whose groundbreaking first novel "The Country Girls" was burned and banned in her native country, has died, her publisher announced on Sunday. She was 93.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "She died peacefully on Saturday 27 July after a long illness," said a statement from publishers Faber Books posted on X, formerly Twitter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Faber called her "one of the greatest writers of our age."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Irish President Michael D Higgins said he had learned of the death of his "dear friend" O'Brien with "great sorrow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was "one of the outstanding writers of modern times" and "a fearless teller of truths," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added: "While the beauty of her work was immediately recognised abroad, it is important to remember the hostile reaction it provoked among those who wished for the lived experience of women to remain far from the world of Irish literature, with her books shamefully banned upon their early publication."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The honours she eventually received from her native Ireland included the Presidential Distinguished Service Award in 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Country Girls" (1960), about the sexual initiation of rebellious Catholic girls, drawn from O'Brien's childhood experiences, is now a marker in modern Irish literature for its breaking of social and sexual taboos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Brien was born in 1930 into a strict Catholic farming family in west Ireland's County Clare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was educated at a convent school and then in Dublin where she graduated with a pharmacist's licence in 1950, around the time she was discovering a passion for Leo Tolstoy, F Scott Fitzgerald and TS Eliot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2018, she won the prestigious PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honoured for having broken down "social and sexual barriers for women in Ireland and beyond."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2021, France made her a Commander in the "Ordre des Arts et des Lettres," the nation's highest cultural distinction. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

    Canada teams subdue Jasper fire but not nearby blazes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two melted chairs are all that remain of this lodge in the town of Jasper. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763605_1_20240729044616.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The wildfires that destroyed nearly a third of the beloved tourist town of Jasper in western Canada are now under control, but firefighters are still battling other nearby blazes that could go on for months, authorities said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fires, touched off on Monday by lightning strikes in a drought-stricken area, are the biggest to hit the vast Jasper National Park in a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 30 percent of the structures in the town of Jasper – a popular tourist destination considered a scenic "jewel" of the Canadian Rockies – have been destroyed, though no deaths have been reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are anticipating that all remaining fires within the townsite will be extinguished today," Parks Canada, the government agency that manages the country's national parks, said on Sunday on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 25,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Jasper beginning late on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parks Canada said teams working in Jasper on Sunday were continuing to secure the town's perimeter to prevent new outbreaks and protect critical infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters – their numbers bolstered by some 400 colleagues from New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa – were using a helicopter to spot and extinguish any flare-ups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the town and the national park remain under evacuation orders. Royal Canadian Mounted Police are patrolling the area, limiting access to "incident staff and critical contractors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town will be reopened only "when the risk of wildfire activity is significantly reduced," Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Landon Shepherd, an agency official, said bringing the fire under control throughout the national park would "not be easy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) of forestland have gone up in smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout Alberta, 135 wildfires remained active on Sunday, about a quarter of them deemed out of control, Parks Canada said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 185 miles (300 kilometres) to the south of Jasper, in British Columbia province, residents of Slocan, a village of some 600 houses, have also had to evacuate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As in the United States, Canada's western region has been hard-hit by wildfires this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Repeated heat waves and dry conditions, both likely linked to global climate change, are believed to be key factors, scientists say. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Adam Peaty was denied in his bid to became the first person to win three consecutive 100m breaststroke titles at the Olympic Games, finishing joint second with America's Nick Fink in a time of 59.05 seconds at La Defense Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Top honours went to Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi who was only 0.02 seconds faster than the Brit and American in a relatively slow final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the second night of swimming got off to a great start for hosts France as swim star Leon Marchand dominated the field in the men's 400m individual medley to win in a new Olympic record time of 4 minutes, 02.95 seconds, just shy of his world mark of 4 minutes, 02.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marchand was ahead as soon as his head popped from the water and he steadily pulled away from the field in what was essentially two separate races: Marchand racing the clock and everyone else competing for silver and bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The silver went to Japan's Tomoyuki Matsushita, who finished nearly 6 seconds behind the winner in 4 minutes, 08.62 seconds. American Carson Foster claimed the bronze a fraction of a second behind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was crazy. I think I will remember this one for a very long time," said Marchand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The emotions are very difficult to describe. It was incredible for a swimmer. I opened my eyes, listened to everything that was happening around. And that really pushed me to already have a great race and have a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, it was a US one-two in the women's 100 metres butterfly as Torri Huske stunned her American teammate and world-record holder Gretchen Walsh to clinch the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Walsh turned first, but Huske came home strongly to touch in 55.59 seconds, with Walsh second in 55.63 and China's Zhang Yufei taking bronze in 56.21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't really remember my race that much. My first 50 felt good, and then I've been really working on my second 50 a lot, especially after last year," said Huske.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian defending champion Maggie Mac Neil finished fifth and Australia's Emma McKeon, the queen of the pool in Tokyo with seven medals, came sixth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In semi-final action, China's Tang Qianting is ranked fourth going into the women's 100m breaststroke final later on Monday while Yang Junxuan is fifth seed going into the women's 200 free. On the men's side, Xu Jiayu qualified first in the 100m backstroke. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

    Hezbollah evacuates positions ahead of expected attack

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Israel frequently hits suspected Hezbollah positions along the southern Lebanese border. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763594_1_20240729014646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hezbollah has evacuated positions in south and east Lebanon after Israeli threats of reprisals for a deadly strike on the annexed Golan Heights, a source close to the group said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant vowed to "hit the enemy hard" a day after rocket fire from Lebanon killed 12 young people in Majdal Shams, again raising fears that the war in Gaza will spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah movement for firing a Falaq-1 Iranian rocket but the Iran-backed group – which has regularly targeted Israeli military positions – said it had "no connection" to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hezbollah has evacuated some positions in the south and in the Bekaa valley that it thinks could be a target for Israel," the source close to the group said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah has a strong presence in east Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which borders Syria, and in south Lebanon, from where it has been launching near daily attacks on Israeli positions since October in support of ally Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cross-border exchanges of fire have largely been limited to the border area, but Israel has repeatedly struck deep inside Lebanon, including overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah is also deployed in Syria, where for years it has been fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said pro-Iran groups and Hezbollah-affiliated fighters have "evacuated their positions" south of the capital and in the Damascus countryside, as well as in parts of the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights, in anticipation of "potential Israeli airstrikes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah had already abandoned positions in Syria in early June after Israeli raids, according to the Britain-based Observatory, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in the country, mainly targeting army positions and Iran-backed fighters, including from Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raids also seek to cut off Hezbollah supply routes to Lebanon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israeli authorities rarely comment on individual strikes in Syria, but have repeatedly said they will not allow arch-enemy Iran to expand its presence there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's raids on Syria intensified after Palestinian militant group Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel sparked war in the Gaza Strip, then eased after an April 1 strike blamed on Israel hit the Iranian consular building in Damascus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That strike prompted Iran to launch a first-ever direct missile and drone attack against Israel on April 13-14, sending regional tensions skyrocketing. (AFP)

 Japan's dominance of Olympic skateboarding continued in Paris on Sunday as World No.1 Coco Yoshizawa won the women's street competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot, and the second highest ranked in the competition, Liz Akama, took silver while Brazil's Rayssa Leal overcame a poor start to the competition to win the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Cui Chenxi finished just outside the medals in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen-year-old Yoshizawa held her arms out wide after sliding down the rail in the highest-scoring attempt of the best-trick stage of the competition, as an enthusiastic crowd at the La Concorde venue cheered wildly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Akama, who had a slim lead heading into the best trick portion of the competition, nailed a sublime 270 switch front board on her opening trick but could not improve on that effort. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<div class="itemFullText">
 George Russell won the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on Sunday holding off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton in a stunning Mercedes 1-2.
 <br>
  <br/>
  McLaren's Oscar Piastri came home in third with pole-sitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari in fourth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started in 11th, finished fifth, extending his championship lead over the second McLaren of Lando Norris who finished one place further back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Russell began the race in sixth place and hit the front after opting for a one-stop pit strategy which saw him nursing his second set of tyres for 34 of the race's 44 laps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We definitely didn't predict this win in our strategy meeting this morning," said Russell for whom this was a third grand prix win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One-two for the team was awesome and what a way to go to the break."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen leads the championship race with 275 points, 78 clear of Norris. Red Bull lead the constructors' championship 42 points ahead of McLaren.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans booed a Dutch beach volleyball player convicted of raping an underage girl as he played his first match at the Paris Olympics, where his controversial selection has put the sport in the spotlight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven van de Velde, now 29, was convicted in 2016 of raping an underage girl and sentenced to four years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He walked onto centre court Sunday with teammate Matthew Immers on Sunday morning to cheers and applause, with many orange-clad Dutch fans standing to clap the pair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When he was introduced individually over the loudspeaker, however, there was a loud chorus of boos from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were also sporadic boos as he served throughout the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The player has won the backing of his country's national Olympic committee, and exchanged a warm hug with teammate Immers before the start of the game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But his selection has drawn outrage among women's and sports safety groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the player would be separated from his teammates, not stay in the athletes' village, and forbidden from speaking to media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His teammate Immers told reporters after the match that they had been "disappointed" by all the focus on van de Velde's past conviction, particularly after a "hard fight" to qualify.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know the guy for two, three years together and we played every tournament," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me that's a big example that you grew, you learned a lot from it. What happened in the past... it's not good of course. But right now we are trying to enjoy and go to the next round," Immers added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ju'Riese Colon, chief executive of the US-based Center for SafeSport, said she was "deeply concerned that anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a minor could participate" in the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With teams from around the world convening in Paris, many of which include minor athletes, this sends a dangerous message that medals and money mean more than their safety," she said. (AFP)

    Tense Venezuela votes in shadow of 'bloodbath' warning

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Incumbent Nicolas Maduro has warned of a "bloodbath" if he loses. Photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763576_1_20240728223317.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Venezuelans voted on Sunday between continuity in President Nicolas Maduro or change in rival Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia amid high tension following the incumbent's threat of a "bloodbath" if he loses, which polls suggest is likely.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With several international observers blocked from entering the South American country at the last minute, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for all parties to "respect the democratic process."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Venezuelan people deserve an election that genuinely reflects their will, free from any manipulation. The international community is going to be watching this very closely," Blinken told reporters in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long queues of voters formed at several voting stations hours before polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT). Polls close at 6:00 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have been here since 4:30 in the morning, and I hope it will be a successful day," lawyer Griselda Barroso, 54, said in Caracas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope there is democracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro, 61, is accused of locking up critics and harassing the opposition in a climate of rising authoritarianism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is seeking a third six-year term at the helm of the once wealthy petro-state that saw GDP drop 80 percent in a decade, pushing more than seven million of its 30 million citizens to emigrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a message published on social media overnight, Maduro urged Venezuelans to "Vote, vote, vote, and peace will triumph."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gonzalez Urrutia, a 74-year-old former diplomat, called on his compatriots to turn out in large numbers "to transform your future" in what "will undoubtedly be the most important democratic expression of the people in recent years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope and wish that everything will transpire in peace," he said in a video posted on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro lags far behind Gonzalez Urrutia in voter intention, according to independent polls, but counts on a loyal electoral machinery, military leadership and state institutions in a system of well-established political patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Relying on its own figures, the government is also said to be certain of victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Polls suggest Sunday's vote poses the biggest threat yet to 25 years of "Chavismo," the populist movement founded by Maduro's predecessor and mentor, Hugo Chavez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But analysts say the president is unlikely to concede defeat, especially in the absence of immunity guarantees, with his government under investigation for human rights abuses by the International Criminal Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Days before the vote, Maduro said the outcome would decide whether Venezuela enters a period of "peace or war."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they do not want Venezuela to become a bloodbath, a fratricidal civil war produced by the fascists, let us guarantee the greatest success, the greatest electoral victory of our people," he said at a rally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments drew condemnation from leaders including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said: "Maduro has to learn: if you win, you stay. If you lose, you go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns were further stoked when Caracas blocked several international observers, including four ex-presidents who had their plane held up in Panama on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on Friday, a Venezuelan NGO said the government was holding 305 "political prisoners" and had arrested 135 people with links to the opposition campaign since January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caracas accuses the opposition of conspiring against Maduro, whose 2018 reelection was rejected as illegitimate by most Western and Latin American countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Years of tough US sanctions failed to dislodge the president, who enjoys support from Cuba, Russia and China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maduro has repeatedly vowed that he won't cede power now even as Venezuelans clamour for change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most live on just a few dollars a month, with the health care and education systems in disrepair and biting shortages of electricity and fuel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government blames sanctions, but observers point the finger at corruption and mismanagement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 21 million Venezuelans are registered to vote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has deployed tens of thousands of security forces and enforced ramped-up border control and a prohibition on public gatherings and protests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While the election in Venezuela will hardly be free or fair, Venezuelans have their best chance in over a decade to elect their government," Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus said this week, urging the international community to "have their (voters') back." (AFP)

  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pauline Ferrand-Prevot delivered France's second gold medal of the Paris Olympics as she took a high-quality field apart to win the women's cross-country mountain bike race on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 32-year-old produced a devastating acceleration at the start of the second of seven laps around the dusty 4.4 kilometre circuit on Elancourt Hill and rode solo to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haley Batten of the US and Jenny Rissveds of Sweden were involved in a fierce scrap for silver with Batten bursting clear to finish runner-up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Young Dutchwoman Puck Pieterse was the only rider who looked capable of making it a race and was alone in second place when she suffered a puncture on lap five and needed a wheel change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ferrand-Prevot, who will return to road racing after the Olympics, is a five-times cross-country world champion but suffered heartbreak at the last two Olympics when favourite.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, in front of thousands of flag-waving French fans in the countryside near Versailles she reigned supreme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe it, I've worked so hard for this day that I was like a robot today," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's so huge that I don't know what to say. In the final lap it was easier to enjoy it." (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni vowed on Sunday to "relaunch" cooperation with China, signing a three-year action plan during her first official visit to Beijing since taking office, Italian news agency ANSA reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meloni made the announcement during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang, as Rome seeks to improve trade ties with Beijing after it exited the Belt and Road infrastructure investment scheme last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian leader said her five-day trip was a "demonstration of the will to begin a new phase, to relaunch our bilateral cooperation", ANSA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action plan will aim to experiment with new forms of cooperation, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meloni, who sees Chinese investment as a way to spur Italy's anaemic economic growth, will meet President Xi Jinping and National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also attended an Italy-China business forum, to which companies including Italian tyre-maker Pirelli, energy group ENI, defence group Leonardo, wine producers and several Italian luxury fashion groups such as Dolce & Gabbana were invited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum gives "another signal of the mutual interest... (to) balance more our interests, our commercial exchange," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Italy should adopt a win-win mentality and increase trade and investment cooperation, making cooperation even more dynamic and sustainable," said Premier Li at the opening of the forum, according to a video shared by Meloni's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bilateral trade and industrial agreements are expected to be signed during Meloni's trip, a source close to the planning has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, Italy became the only Group of Seven country to join the massive Belt and Road Initiative but withdrew last year under US pressure over concerns about Beijing's economic reach. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday booked a place in the women's 200m freestyle semifinals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 min 56.38 secs was the fifth fastest overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey will compete in the semifinals, early Monday Hong Kong time.

  <br/>
  Among the SAR swimmer's main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, as well as Ariarne Titmus, fresh from winning the 400m freestyle. Titmus also holds the world and Olympic records for the women's 200m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m freestyle in the Tokyo Games three years ago.

 Hong Kong fencer Daphne Chan made a winning Olympic debut on Sunday at the Grand Palais in Paris, edging out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the women’s foil individual round of 32.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was a tight back-and-forth affair early on before Chan started widening the gap, ending the first period with a 7-4 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan scored an early point in the next round to extend her lead, but Azuma refused to go quietly, picking up a few points to tie the score at 11 at the end of the second period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third and final period was also a closely fought battle, with the 19-year-old SAR fencer emerging victorious over her Japanese rival ranked 19 places above her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan next takes on Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

 China's Xie Yu on Sunday won the country's second gold medal in shooting at the Paris Olympics, and the third overall, after claiming victory in the men's 10-metre air pistol event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xie, who placed sixth in the qualification round, gave a strong performance and topped the scoreboard in the final with a total of 240.9 points.

    Crowds at Prince Edward amid partial MTR suspension

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR says there were larger-than-normal crowds at Prince Edward station. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763535_1_20240728165335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said there were larger crowds on Sunday at Prince Edward station than normal because of a partial suspension of services, but made it clear crowd-control measures were in place to facilitate travel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company suspended services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on the Kwun Tong Line to carry out large-scale tunnel asset renewal work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations – Prince Edward, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Ho Man Tin – are still being served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line, while Prince Edward is the only interchange station between the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at Yau Ma Tei station, Cheris Lee, the MTR's chief of operating and metro segment, says staff have been told to be proactive in assisting passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she believed the impact of suspension will be minimised, with the maintenance work being carried out on a Sunday during the summer vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Passengers can still use our alternative routes to all stations today," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR deployed more than 1,000 staff to facilitate operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement later in the day, the firm described the overall situation on Sunday as smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One passenger, surnamed Wong, said the suspension should have happened on a weekday, given the number of mainland tourists and foreign domestic helpers who were off on Sunday. "At least during the weekdays, there will be fewer people, at least fewer mainlanders... this (the suspension along with the rain) would create a more negative impact to Hong Kong's image," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR also reminded passengers who are travelling to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line to be 20 to 30 minutes early, to ensure they'll catch the last train.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday began a six-day trip to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to further explore business opportunities there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Laos, Lee said he will persuade the three Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries to back Hong Kong's inclusion in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meet with local leaders to introduce Hong Kong's economic development and opportunities, and I will continue to seek their support for us to join the RCEP," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second, we will promote economic and trade exchanges in different regions. We will present Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a 'super value-adder,' showcasing what we can offer such as professional services, our experience, our connections, and how we can guide them to benefit from opportunities in Hong Kong and also enter the mainland market and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted that the combined population of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam totals around 120 million, describing them as a huge market and business prospect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's delegation includes some 30 leaders from various business and technology sectors.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the upcoming economic figures indicate sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a blog post, Chan said the government will this week unveil GDP figures for the second quarter.
  <br/>

  Chan noted that both exports and investments have shown continual growth, attributed to an uptick in external demand and a surge in the nation's overall exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the finance minister expressed optimism that challenges from geopolitics will likely diminish, which will benefit investment and asset markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the stable growth of the mainland economy will provide significant support to Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that a series of exhibitions and large-scale events will bring in more tourists and consumers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia began their Olympic swim campaign with two golds while the United States stamped their authority in the men's 4x100 metres freestyle relay to win in a time of 3 minutes, 9.28 seconds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Australia took silver and Italy won bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's relay capped an exciting night of Olympic swimming at La Defense Arena, which began when Germany's Lukas Maertens surged to victory in the men's 400 metres freestyle gold medal, narrowly missing the world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old was under world record pace for 350 metres before fading in the final stretch to touch in 3 minutes, 41.78 seconds ahead of Australia's Elijah Winnington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korean 2024 world champion Kim Woo-min took bronze in 3 minutes, 42.50 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maertens was overcome with emotion after his win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Means everything to me -- you can see my progress in performance... I am extremely happy and just overwhelmed," said Maertens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can't put into words what I am feeling now."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The women's 400 metres freestyle final wasn't as fast as expected but it saw defending champion and world record holder Ariarne Titmus stamp her dominance from the get go.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Australian led from start to finish to win in 3 minutes 57.49 seconds, holding off the challenge from Canada's Summer McIntosh who took silver while US star Katie Ledecky grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm just happy to get the result for myself and I feel so honoured to be a part of the race and be alongside legends like Katie," said Titmus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look up to her so much as an athlete and there's certainly not a rivalry beyond the races. I really respect her as a person and I hope that I put on a good show tonight and everyone enjoyed it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia also claimed their fourth consecutive gold in the women's 400 freestyle relay in an Olympic record time of 3 minutes, 28.92 seconds as the Dolphins out fought their American rivals who took silver in an Americas record time while China won bronze with a new Asian mark. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Engineers from national rail operator SNCF repair cables damaged in the attacks. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763483_1_20240728042748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's national rail operator on Saturday said train travel was gradually returning to normal after multiple sabotage acts paralysed the network hours ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It remains unclear who carried out the three attacks overnight Thursday to Friday on rail infrastructure and if they were deliberately timed to disrupt the Olympics opening ceremony that took place later that day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a message of support for the sabotage was sent to several media outlets on Saturday, which also criticised the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tens of thousands of rail passengers struggled through a second day of cancelled and delayed trains on Saturday with 160,000 of the 800,000 people due to travel on a major holiday getaway weekend still facing cancellations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said national rail operator SNCF had mobilised a hundred workers overnight to repair the damage "in difficult weather conditions" and ensure a return to normal for Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the night, "with floodlights, in the rain, they patched up the wires one by one," said SNCF chief executive Jean-Pierre Farandou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everything will be repaired by Monday morning" on the SNCF network, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fibre optic cables running near the tracks and ensuring the transmission of safety information for drivers, such as signalling lights and points, were cut and set on fire during the night from Thursday to Friday on three of the main TGV lines, in the west, north and east of France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No claim of responsibility has been made for the meticulously planned night-time attacks. Maintenance workers thwarted a fourth attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a statement sent to several news media expressed support for the sabotage and criticised the Olympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They call it a festival? We see it as a celebration of nationalism, a gigantic stating of the subjugation of populations by states," said the email received by the newspaper La Provence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the headline of the message said, "claim to sabotage," no details of the action were provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was signed by "an unexpected delegation" and was sent via the online platform Riseup, whose users include those advocating for social change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paris prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into an attack on "fundamental national interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observers have noted that the nature of the attacks indicate the culprits would have needed deep knowledge of the functioning of the railways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the investigation was progressing, as he also expressed "relief" that the opening ceremony had taken place without any mishap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have uncovered a certain number of elements that allow us to think that we will soon know who is responsible for what clearly did not sabotage the Olympic Games but did sabotage part of the holidays of the French people," Darmanin told France 2 television.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was "too early" to say who was behind the attack. "It could have come from inside (France) or from the outside."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  French authorities are on high alert for a terrorist attack during the Games, which run through August 11. Tens of thousands of police and troops are on security duties during the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 250,000 people missed their train on Friday, according to SNCF.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three out of every 10 trains were cancelled on Saturday in the three regions affected by the attacks, with most trains still operating delayed by between one and two hours, SNCF said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one third of trains were cancelled in northern, western and eastern France. About a quarter of Eurostar high speed trains between Paris and London and Paris and Brussels were also called off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With normal services set to be fully restored on Monday, the situation is already expected to improve markedly on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nine out of 10 TGV high speed trains will be able to run on the western and southwestern lines on Sunday, while service will be more patchy in the north, where seven out of 10 trains are due to run, SNCF said. Trains to eastern France have not been affected. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France won an historic first gold medal in men's Olympic Rugby Sevens, beating two-time defending champions and rugby sevens' powerhouses Fiji 28-7 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was also the first gold medal of the Games for the host nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tied at 7-7 going into the break, the French dominated the Fijians much to the delight of the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Antoine Dupont scored two tries and set up another to inspire France to the win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result is a remarkable comeback for the French who failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Africa beat Australia 26-19 in a closely-fought bronze-medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Aussies took a 7-5 lead at the break, but the Springbok Sevens took control of the match in the second half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two quick tries by Zain Davids, both converted by Tristan Leyds, coupled with a red card to Australia's Nick Malouf for a dangerous tackle on Tiaan Pretorius, put South Africa in control at 19-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the Aussies scored two late tries, one of which was converted, to pull level on the scoreboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From the last restart, with seconds left on the clock, the Springboks created space on the left with Selvyn Davids racing away before giving the ball to Shaun Williams to score the match - and medal - winner. (Agencies)

 Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix on pole position with Red Bull's Sergio Perez next to him on the front row.
 <br>
  <br/>
  World champion Max Verstappen was 0.595 seconds quicker than Leclerc in a wet qualifying session on Saturday but the Red Bull driver starts in 11th place because of a 10-place grid penalty for taking a new engine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I definitely did not expect that this weekend but with the tricky conditions we could do something above our expectations," said Leclerc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a good day for the team and now we need to focus on tomorrow and see what will happen when the rain is gone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verstappen's teammate Perez, who was just 0.011sec behind Leclerc, will join the Monegasque on the front row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton starts from third in his Mercedes, followed by the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, who locked out an impressive 1-2 in the last race in Hungary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mercedes' George Russell was seventh fastest ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and the Alpine of Esteban Ocon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong will be the first Hong Kong, China medallist of the 2024 Paris Olympics after a dramatic semi-final victory in the women's epee in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one defeated Estonia's Nelli Differt 15-11 in a nail-biting semi-final that saw the lead change hands frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first period started with a tight back and forth tussle that resulted in a two-all tie. That intensity continued into the second period, as the two players went neck to neck but Kong was able to move herself up on the scoreboard 8-7 by the end of that spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong successfully widened the gap in the final round, adding seven points to pull herself into the gold medal bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencing queen is the second person from the SAR to win a fencing medal after Tokyo champion Edgar Cheung, and the first in the epee discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold or silver will be Hong Kong first ever medal in women's fencing. She'll face local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in the final at 3.30am, Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 FIFA deducted six points from Canada in the Paris Olympics women’s football tournament and banned three coaches for one year each on Saturday in a drone spying scandal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The stunning swath of punishments include a US$226,000 fine for the Canadian soccer federation in a case that has spiraled at the Summer Games. Two assistant coaches were caught using drones to spy on opponent New Zealand’s practices before their opening game last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Bev Priestman, who led Canada to the Olympic title in Tokyo in 2021, already was suspended by the national soccer federation then removed from the Olympic tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priestman and her two assistants implicated in the case, Joseph Lombardi and Jasmine Mander, are now banned from all soccer for one year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA fast-tracked its own disciplinary process by asking its appeals judges to handle the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FIFA judges found Priestman and her two assistants “were each found responsible for offensive behavior and violation of the principles of fair play.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Canadian federation was held responsible for not ensuring its staff complied with tournament rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coaches and the Canadian federation now can challenge their sanctions at the Court of Arbitration for Sport's special Olympic court in Paris. That tribunal is set up for urgent hearings and verdicts at the Olympics. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 11 people were killed in a rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday, Israeli Channel 13 reported, amid an escalation of fire between Israel and armed groups in Lebanon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli emergency service said earlier that 11 people were critically wounded by a rocket fired from Lebanon that hit a village football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams. A medic described great destruction and fire at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However senior Hezbollah media representative Mohammad Afif denied responsibility for the strike on Majdal Shams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading fire since October, after Hamas' attack on southern Israel triggered the Gaza war, in their worst escalation since 2006. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid unveiled Brazilian teenager Endrick, who has joined the European champions on a six-year deal, in an event at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Endrick, who turned 18 last week, arrives from the Brazilian club Palmeiras, where he won two league titles and a Super Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made his international debut aged 17 against Colombia last November, going on to score his first goal against England in a 1-0 win in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was a member of Brazil's Copa America squad, making his first international start in the quarter-final with Uruguay which they lost on penalties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't have words to describe what I'm feeling because I've always wanted to be here," Endrick said during his presentation at the Bernabeu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I wanted to play for Madrid, it's like a dream coming true today."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real Madrid begin the defence of their La Liga title when they face Mallorca on August 18. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo jumped out to a 2-0 lead, before Dora Madarasz and Nandor Ecseki clawed a game back 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hungarians lost the fourth game 11-6 as the SAR duo stormed their way to take the final game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our belief never wavered. We hope we can play every point well. And in the end, we managed to do that," Wong told reporters in the post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair will face Maria Xiao and Alvaro Robles from Spain in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong gymnast Stone Shek was unable to make it to the final round in vault, finishing 12th in the qualifying round with eight athletes making the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He miscued his first jump after landing on his feet and needed to use his hands to regain his balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shek, who was making his third Olympic appearance after London and Tokyo, ended up with a score of 14.099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite not advancing further, the gymnast, 32, said Paris was a very good experience which he found to be the most enjoyable and pressure free in his 20 odd years in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because vault after all is a little bit like gambling. No matter how good you do during practice, when you can't make the move during the competition, you can't," Shek told reporters.

    Japan's Sado mines added to World Heritage list

    <![CDATA[<img alt="People celebrate after the Sado Island Gold Mine was registered as a World Heritage Site. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763465_1_20240728004100.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A network of mines on a Japanese island infamous for using conscripted wartime labour was added to Unesco's World Heritage register on Saturday after South Korea dropped earlier objections to its listing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sado gold and silver mines, now a popular tourist attraction, are believed to have started operating as early as the 12th century and produced until after World War II.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had put a case for World Heritage listing because of their lengthy history and the artisanal mining techniques used there at a time when European mines had turned to mechanisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The proposal was opposed by Seoul when it was first put because of the use of involuntary Korean labour during World War II, when Japan occupied the Korean peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But South Korea's foreign ministry said it had agreed to the listing "on the condition that Japan faithfully implements the recommendation... to reflect the 'full history' at the Sado Gold Mine site."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unesco confirmed the listing at its ongoing committee meeting in New Delhi after a bid highlighting the archaeological preservation of "mining activities and social and labour organisation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The inscription was the result of a 14-year effort," Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to share this joy with local people as well as all Japanese citizens."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan had reiterated a pledge to keeping the memories alive of "the harsh labour conditions of all workers," the foreign ministry in Tokyo said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that exhibits on Sado island included data showing a higher percentage of Korean labourers were engaged in dangerous underground tasks, while others fled or were detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Historians have argued that recruitment conditions at the mine effectively amounted to forced labour, and that Korean workers faced significantly harsher conditions than their Japanese counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discrimination did exist," Toyomi Asano, a professor of history of Japanese politics at Tokyo's Waseda University, said in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their working conditions were very bad and dangerous. The most dangerous jobs were allocated to them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sado mines were listed alongside the Beijing Central Axis, a collection of former imperial palaces and gardens in the Chinese capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 589-hectare heritage area reflects "the ancient Chinese tradition of urban planning, serving as an important emblem that highlights the distinctive characteristics of Chinese civilisation," state news agency Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other listings this week include the centuries-old, ornate burial mounds of the Ahom Dynasty in northeastern India and the Marquesas Islands in French Polynesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Saint Hilarion complex, one of the oldest monasteries in the Middle East dating back to the fourth century, was meanwhile added to a list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the war in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Unesco committee meeting runs until Wednesday. (AFP)

    Israeli strike on Gaza school kills 30

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Palestinians inspect the damage following the Israeli strike on the Khadija school housing displaced people in Deir al-Balah.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said an Israeli strike on Saturday on a school killed 30 people, after a days-long military operation further south left around 170 dead, according to the civil defence agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Since July 6 at least eight schools – including the latest one – have been hit leaving more than 100 people dead, based on a tally of tolls given by the health ministry and a hospital source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With most of Gaza's 2.4 million people displaced at least once during the war started by the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, many have sought refuge in school buildings including the one hit on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest strike in the Deir el-Balah city area targeted Khadija school, the health ministry said. More than 100 people were wounded, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said it carried out a strike on the school targeting "terrorists" operating there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in the Khan Younis city area, around 170 people have been killed "and hundreds wounded" during an Israeli operation over several days there, Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It issued the toll after the military earlier on Saturday warned of new operations in the area and issued fresh evacuation orders for residents of Khan Younis, where troops had earlier recovered the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egyptian state-linked media said Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators are to meet with Israeli negotiators in the Italian capital on Sunday in the latest push for a Gaza truce, which critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused him of blocking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The United Nations said more than 180,000 Palestinians had already fled fierce fighting in Khan Younis since the military operation began almost a week ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The evacuation orders and "intensified hostilities" have "significantly destabilised aid operations," the UN said, reporting "dire water, hygiene and sanitation conditions" in the Palestinian territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel had warned last Monday that its forces would "forcefully operate" in the Khan Younis region – from where rockets had been fired – including an area previously declared a safe humanitarian zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khan Younis was left devastated after heavy fighting early in the year but the military withdrew in April saying it had "concluded its mission" there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now it has returned in force. On Wednesday the military said troops carried out an operation in Khan Younis and retrieved the bodies of five Israelis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They had been killed during the October 7 attack on Israel and their bodies taken back to Gaza, the military said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military said on Friday that its forces had "eliminated approximately 100" militants in Khan Younis during the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said the captives' bodies were pulled from underground tunnels and walls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The October 7 attack that began the war resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to a tally based on official Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed at least 39,258 people, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not provide details of civilian and militant deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its latest toll on Saturday included 83 deaths over the previous 48 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday, the military ordered residents from more parts of Khan Younis "to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi" – the second such adjustment made to the safe zone within a week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further south, in Rafah, medics said on Saturday that four people were killed and several wounded in an air strike on a house.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's military on Saturday said troops had targeted "military infrastructure sites" in the Rafah area and "eliminated dozens" of militants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Al-Qahera news, which has links to Egyptian intelligence, reported on Friday that talks "to reach agreement on a truce in Gaza" would take place on Sunday in Rome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US news outlet Axios separately reported that CIA Director Bill Burns was expected to hold talks in Rome with Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest mediation efforts have focused on a ceasefire and hostage-release accompanied by the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. US President Joe Biden presented the framework in late May, billing it as an Israeli proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting on Thursday in Washington, Biden called on Netanyahu to "finalise" a deal and "reach a durable end to the war in Gaza," the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That same day, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has regularly protested for a deal, alleged "deliberate sabotage" of talks and demanded an urgent meeting with Israeli negotiators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their accusation came after a source with knowledge of the talks said the arrival of Israeli negotiators in Qatar had been postponed from Thursday to this coming week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eszter Muhari of Hungary or France's Auriane Mello-Breton await in the final later.

 Australian Grace Brown destroyed the field to claim her country's first gold medal of the Games in the women's individual time trial, her power and bike handling abilities being unmatched by her rivals on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Several riders slid and fell on wet and cobbled corners on the 32.4-kilometre course, with defending champion Chloe Dygert ending up being the biggest casualty and having to settle for bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Anna Henderson took third place, one minute 31.59 seconds behind Brown's winning time of 39 minutes 38.24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dygert hit the deck on a corner in the Bois de Vincennes, which effectively ended her chances of retaining her title and cost her second place as she ended 0.87 seconds behind Henderson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And it was a good day for Belgium in the men's individual time trial as Remco Evenepoel won the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Evenepoel added the Olympic gold to his world title on Saturday, defying rain and a strong field to win on the 32.4 kilometre course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-year-old was almost 15 seconds faster than Italian Filippo Ganna in second while Evenepoel's compatriot, Wout van Aert, took bronze. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Puddles at the skateboarding arena as Saturday's events were delayed because of rain. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763452_1_20240727215944.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pouring rain in Paris on Saturday forced the men's Olympics street skateboarding competition to be postponed and tennis matches were also delayed, while athletes had mixed feelings about how to cope with the unexpectedly wet weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, a dazzling but soaked opening ceremony for the Summer Games saw thousands of athletes parade on a flotilla of barges on the Seine, at the heart of the French capital, waving to the crowd despite the downpour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese badminton player He Bingjiao laughed when she was asked if she thought the opening ceremony had been beautiful, saying she did not make it because of the weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately I couldn't attend because of the rain. I had to rest," she said. "It's not normal to have had a ceremony like this on the boats. I was watching it on my phone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rain continued on Saturday, forcing some events to be rescheduled and umbrellas were more in evidence than sunglasses at the beach volleyball at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk factor becomes too high when skateboarding in the rain," a spokesperson for World Skate said after Saturday's competition was rescheduled to Monday because La Concorde, the outdoor venue where it was supposed to take place, was drenched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening day of the tennis event was also disrupted, with thousands of spectators without tickets for the two main show courts left frustrated after negotiating lengthy queues to get in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Play began on time under the Court Philippe Chatrier roof and across the complex on Court Suzanne Lenglen. But play on the uncovered courts was delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Paris 2024 organisers said they were confident the triathlon events would take place as scheduled on Tuesday even though the rain might lead to Sunday's training session being cancelled due to concerns over the water quality in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes themselves were not that bothered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm from Oslo, so this is a perfect Norwegian summer," Inger Seim Kavlie, Norway women's double sculls rower, said with a grin as the rained poured down in the mixed zone, close to the finish line. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called on the United States to return to a rational and pragmatic policy towards China as he urged Washington not to continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang also urged the United States to "refrain from fanning the flames" in the territorial dispute between Beijing and the Philippines, the foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US side should refrain from fanning the flames, stirring up trouble and undermining stability at sea," Wang said, according to a ministry statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Wang met with his US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US hailed the talks between Blinken and Wang as "open and productive" with the two sides discussing issues of mutual concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's talks lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior US State Department official. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong on Saturday advanced to the quarterfinals of the women's epee individual event, after defeating the United States’ Hadley Husisian 15-12 in the group of 16 match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one ended the first round with a strong 3-1 lead. Kong then widened the gap further in the second period earning five points to bring the score to 8-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two then were locked in a back and forth contest at the start of the final round, but Kong ultimately advanced to the last eight by bringing in three more points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong had reached the quarterfinals during the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will be facing Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska next.

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763439_1_20240727195849.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Olympic Committee apologised on Saturday for a gaffe during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in which South Korean athletes were incorrectly introduced as North Korean.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine river in the French capital, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: "Republique populaire democratique de Coree" in French, then "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" in English.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony," the IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The error sparked displeased reactions in South Korea, that is technically still at war with the North.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Korean Sport & Olympic Committee said later on Saturday that it had received a message from the IOC indicating that its chief, Thomas Bach, wished to directly apologise to the president of South Korea over the phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, South Korea's sports ministry said in a statement it "expresses regret" over the announcement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Second vice sports minister Jang Mi-ran, a 2008 Olympic weightlifting champion, has asked for a meeting with IOC chief Bach to discuss the matter, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country's foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the French embassy in Seoul which expressed regret over what it said was an "incomprehensible mistake".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea was correctly introduced with the country's official name. (AFP)

    Ledecky edges Titmus in Olympic 400m free heats

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763438_1_20240727193222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American great Katie Ledecky edged defending champion Ariarne Titmus to be quickest into the Olympic 400m freestyle final on Saturday, setting the scene for a titanic battle for gold.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The veteran, who was stunned by the Australian in Tokyo three years ago, touched in 4 minutes 02.19 seconds at a packed La Defense Arena ahead of an evening final on day one of the nine-day meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Racing in the same heat, Titmus went out hard and led through 300m before Ledecky came storming home to win by a fingertip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus hit the wall in 4:02.46, well outside her 3:55.38 world record as both swimmers conserved energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand rising star and current world champion Erika Fairweather was third quickest in 4:02.55, a fraction clear of Canadian Summer McIntosh, who snatched the world record last year before Titmus took it back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Good to walk out to a full stadium for our prelims race," said Ledecky, who will also swim the 800m and 1500m in Paris but has dropped the 200m.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It felt very similar to our Olympic trials a few weeks back, so I'm excited to see the finals atmosphere tonight as well and just happy to get a good first one under the belt."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Titmus said the race helped "blow the cobwebs out" and denied coming second gave Ledecky any psychological advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think so. It's a heats swim," said the Australian, who broke the 200m freestyle world record and swam the second quickest 400m ever at the Australian trials last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only job for me was to get in the middle lanes [for the final] and I tried to conserve as much as I could." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."
