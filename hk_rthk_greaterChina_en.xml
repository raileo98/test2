<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his annual work report at the Great Hall of the People, Li said the central government supports Hong Kong and Macau in improving their economies and livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support Hong Kong and Macau in growing their economies, improving the lives of their people, and deepening international exchanges and cooperation," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will ensure that Hong Kong and Macau better integrate themselves into China's overall development and maintain long-term prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, Li said China resolutely opposes "Taiwan independence" and external interference, to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said that Beijing is ready to work with the international world to promote a community with a shared future for mankind.

 China on Wednesday said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the National People's Congress opening said the country will pursue integrated advancements in technological and industrial innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries of the future and foster industries such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said authorities will unleash the digital economy under its AI Plus initiative, which will work to combine digital technologies with China’s manufacturing and market strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation, intelligent, large-scale AI models”, and development of next-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing terminals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time AI models were mentioned in the work report, which comes after the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will strive to create an enabling environment for innovation that encourages exploration and tolerates failure," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also laid out ways the country would deepen multilateral and regional economic cooperation, saying Beijing will continue to expand the nation’s globally-oriented network of free trade areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will resolutely safeguard the WTO-centred multilateral trading system, broaden converging interests with other countries and promote shared development,” it said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 China on Wednesday said it will aim for economic growth of around 5 percent in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the start of the National People's Congress session also outlined other goals for the year, including a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent, over 12 million new urban jobs, and an around 2 percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In setting the growth rate at around five percent, we have taken into account the need to stabilise employment, prevent risks and improve the people's well-being, as well as the potential for growth and the conditions supporting growth," the document said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A target of around five percent is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver," the document added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy grew by 5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also aims for a budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2025, up from 3 percent a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the work report, China will support and encourage private investment, and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country will issue 500 billion yuan of special treasury bonds this year to support large state-owned commercial banks in replenishing capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said that central authorities are keenly aware of the problems and challenges confronting China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,” Li said, describing them as increasingly complex and severe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Global economic growth lacks steam, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, the multilateral trading system is experiencing disruptions and tariff barriers continue to increase.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also noted that the "foundation for China‘s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough", saying that demand is weak and consumption is sluggish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Greater efforts need to be made to address social problems and guard against risks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stay committed to pursuing progress while ensuring stability." (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    China's Liu Jiakun wins Pritzker Prize

<img alt="Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794280_1_20250305083557.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pritzker Prize, dubbed the 'Nobel' for architecture, was awarded on Tuesday to China's Liu Jiakun, for designs that celebrate "everyday lives".
 <br>
  <br>
  "In a global context where architecture is struggling to find adequate responses to fast evolving social and environmental challenges, Liu Jiakun has provided convincing answers that also celebrate the everyday lives of people as well as their communal and spiritual identities," the award's jury wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1956, Liu has worked on more than 30 projects in China ranging from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces and commercial buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Architecture should reveal something - it should abstract, distill and make visible the inherent qualities of local people," Liu said in the statement, evoking his craft's capacity to create "a sense of shared community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.
  <br>
  <br>
  His projects include the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, a large circular structure with a skylight that illuminates an interior strip of photographs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Aravena, who won the award in 2016 and is chair of the jury, said Liu's works offer "clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanisation" especially because they are sometimes "a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life," Aravena said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who is the 54th recipient of the Pritzker Prize, will be honoured at a celebration in Abu Dhabi in spring, award organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year's prize went to Japan's Riken Yamamoto, whose projects are credited with promoting human contact and who said at the time his objective was to "design architecture that can bring joy to people around it". (AFP)

    'China GDP could be affected by US tariffs'

<img alt="A finance expert says the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794282_1_20250305085101.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the United States over President Donald Trump's tariff increases on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement comes a day after Trump ordered additional tariffs against Chinese goods, increasing previously imposed 10 percent levies to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation," Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement, adding that it was "strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed" to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US tariffs, Beijing has imposed new duties on a range of agricultural imports from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The additional 15 percent tariffs on products including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton are due to come into effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will, in accordance with WTO rules, firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and defend... the international economic and trade order," the commerce ministry statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A WTO official confirmed to AFP that the new complaint from China had been received.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States says while China needs to firmly defend its interests, it will continue to handle Sino-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xie Feng’s comments came after US President Donald Trump's order to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports, from 10 to 20 percent, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against the tariffs by announcing additional levies of up to 15 percent on various US agricultural products, including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from March 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie said those who start conflicts by harming others will ultimately hurt themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the one side, we must acknowledge the significant challenges facing China-US relations. On the flip side, we should maintain our confidence in China's progress and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, staying determined. Whether it’s a tariff war or trade war, such disputes often begin by harming others but end up hurting oneself," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie is currently in Beijing for the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.

 The chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) outlined efforts to advance Chinese modernisation and refine standards and procedures at the start of the top political advisory body's annual session in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

 Entrepreneurs and leaders of mainland private enterprises have expressed hope that Beijing will roll out more supportive measures to assist with the nation's industrial upgrade, while balancing the development of various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the annual "two sessions", or "lianghui", kicked off on Tuesday, with thousands of political elites and lawmakers arriving in the capital to set policy agenda for the country's strategic areas including in economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, He Xiaopeng, chief executive officer of Chinese EV company XPeng, noted that while China has always been supportive of its private sector, more measures were being offered to firms that fall into the so-called "entity industries", which include agriculture, industrial production, telecommunications, and infrastructure construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, who is an NPC deputy, also hoped to bring XPeng's latest flying vehicles technology to Hong Kong to grasp opportunities offered by the SAR's so-called "low-altitude economy".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to let more people see the latest dynamics in the low-altitude flying technology," he told RTHK, adding that XPeng wuold also apply for trials covering flying vehicles and that there was vast potential in the industry, especially in the coastal regions.

    China's economy solid amid challenges: NPC spokesman

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s economy has a solid foundation with new growth drivers despite facing some challenges in the coming year, a spokesman for the top legislature said on Tuesday, as dates for the parliament’s annual session were announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) will kick off on Wednesday and run until March 11, lasting for seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the session, Beijing is expected to announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Undoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought the external environment have deepened and China’s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,” Lou Qinjian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But it’s more important to note that China’s economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience and vast potential.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States doubling additional tariffs on Chinese imports, the spokesman said trade disputes should be settled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  “By imposing unilateral tariffs, the US has violated WTO rules and disrupted the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains,” Lou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the US can work in the same direction as China and find a solution through equal-footed consultation. China is also ready to work more closely with other countries to safeguard the hard-earned multilateral trading system, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and advance a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said the progress of DeepSeek reflects the rise of Chinese companies in artificial intelligence, saying such firms have become the backbone of the country’s science and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lou said while artificial intelligence technologies are accompanied by “unknown risks”, China attaches great importance to their development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on Tuesday said she hopes the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) will fully consider its plan to set up the SAR's third medical school.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Shuyang, a member of the National People's Congress, told RTHK that the hospital has worked with the institution on technology and technological research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both parties also cooperate on medical projects, medical education and training for doctors, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zhang said she was unaware of HKUST's plan to start a medical school.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she hopes the university will conduct research on its proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKUST's president Nancy Ip revealed earlier that research and technology would be a focus of the medical school.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, and also a delegate to the National People's Congress, on Tuesday said the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme to Qingdao provided great convenience for exchanges between Qingdao and the two SARs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The scheme was expanded in March last year to cover a number of mainland cities, including Qingdao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeng Zanrong told RTHK ahead of the preparatory meeting of the National People's Congress the implementation of the scheme had gone very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted there were many exchanges between Qingdao and the SARs on various aspects, including technological innovation, finance, and shipping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foshan mayor Bai Tao said he will work to get his city covered by the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bai, who's also an NPC delegate, said he welcomes Hong Kong residents to travel to Foshan, adding that there are no barriers to doing so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he believes visits can foster the relationship between people in the two cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor also said he welcomes SAR enterprises to expand their businesses in Foshan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing a range of between 10 and 15 percent hikes to import levies covering a basket of American agricultural and food products, while placing 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "An additional 15 percent tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton," the Finance Ministry said, adding "additional 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's unilateral tariffs measures seriously violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US," the Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the statement added.
  <br>

  US President Donald Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, launching new trade conflicts with the top three US trading partners. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the capital have stepped up security ahead of the annual “Two Sessions” meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates are in Beijing for the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) starting on Tuesday and the National People's Congress (NPC) a day later.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are more patrolling officers and security guards. Public security officers are also doing ID checks,” a Beijing resident told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A tourist from the Netherlands said this is his first visit to Beijing, and he felt safe thanks to the presence of more officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the metro, there are guards at the entrance, so when you go inside they check [and] see if you bring no trouble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to go to the scanner, put your bags in the scanner and they just see if you have nothing with you that you can't bring.”
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC deputy, Johnny Ng, believes the arrangements this year will be more flexible, allowing them to communicate better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We can flexibly have more communication with other delegates in CPPCC because we have over 2,000 [to] 3,000 people together,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope that we can have more communications this year, in order to make sure Hong Kong can have more cooperation with other delegates and cities.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to retaliate against fresh US import tariffs set to take effect later in the day, reiterating its stance that the Trump administration was trying to "shift the blame" and "bully" Beijing over fentanyl flows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra 10 percent duty that US President Donald Trump threatened China with last week is expected to enter into force at 0501 GMT on March 4, resulting in a cumulative 20 percent tariff in response to what the White House considers Chinese inaction over drug flows.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariff represents an additional hike to pre-existing levies on thousands of Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Times reported on Monday that China had American agricultural and food products in its crosshairs, and would hit back with a series of both tariffs and non-tariff measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has repeatedly stated that the US' unilateral tariffs violate World Trade Organization rules and undermine the multilateral trade system, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such measures will not solve [the US'] problems but instead will harm China-US economic and trade cooperation and disrupt regular international trade," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China urges the US to "immediately withdraw" its unilateral tariff measures that are "unreasonable and groundless, harmful to others," the ministry added. (Reuters)

 A local economics academic said he does not expect major policy shifts in the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, saying it's important for the central government to focus on stabilising sentiment and continuing with high-quality growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR and around the country are in Beijing for the opening of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Tuesday and the National People's Congress a day later, during which Beijing will announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho Lok-sang, an adjunct research professor from Lingnan University, said he expects mainland authorities to set a target of five percent, similar to last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pretty sure that the most likely target would be five percent, which is in my mind certainly within reach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho highlighted the need for the world's second-largest economy to pursue high-quality growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's possible for China to achieve five percent, but there's no need to raise the target to suggest that they're very keen in pushing up economic growth. Five percent, I think, is a target that will produce the effect of giving confidence, and at the same time showing continuity."
  <br>
  <br>
  The academic believes under President Xi Jinping's leadership, the priorities this year include spurring domestic spending, boosting confidence and attracting more foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to stimulate consumption. Internal consumption is something that's within the government's control, but external factors are difficult to tell... Continuing to open up is a main responsibility that President Xi has considered to be a priority, continuing to give the impression that we are really opening up, and all countries from Europe, North America, anywhere, are welcome to China."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and authorities are now drawing up blueprints for the period between 2026 and 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not expect any surprises and I think it's important for China – at this time – not to produce any surprises, because there had been some significant policy movement, initiatives in the past, and that had rocked market sentiments," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said improving governance is another key focus at this year's "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance has been on the agenda for quite some time, and improving governance is a way to boost people's confidence in the leadership.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Improving governance through introducing new laws can enhance people's confidence in the policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one likes policies that come out of the blue, right? But if you improve governance, you're securing an atmosphere that is guaranteed by the legal framework."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates to the nation's top political advisory body who met with senior mainland official Xia Baolong in Beijing on Monday evening quoted him as saying the city should unite in supporting Chief Executive John Lee's administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia, who heads the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, held talks with Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates from the two SARs, a day before the opening of this year's CPPCC meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates said during the 70-minute meeting with Xia, he highly praised the achievements of the two SARs in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local CPPCC member, Ho Hon-kuen, said Xia stressed that Hong Kong should work together as a whole.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Talking about the upcoming Legislative Council election, he said the current members have done a good job, but he hopes the next term can be even better,” Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He also said Hong Kong should unite and support the work of the chief executive. He said under the current economic and political situation, we should be confident in ourselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong has the advantage of the One Country, Two Systems principle, and the central government and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office fully support the SAR's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local CPPCC member, Junius Ho, said they had discussions about the global political and economic situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Junius Ho also mentioned Hong Kong's current situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The stability and prosperity that we are now enjoying do not come easy. We need to treasure them. We need to make it a sustainable growth. We need to maintain it. I think this requires concerted efforts, and we are all committed to do that,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee begins on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual session of China's top political advisory body will run from Tuesday to March 10, authorities announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The third session of the 14th CPPCC National Committee will begin on Tuesday 3pm at the Great Hall of the People, and about 3,000 Chinese and international journalists have signed up to cover the annual meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said the week-long session will review the work of the national committee in the past year and plan for its work this year, while also discussing government work reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a media briefing, the session's spokesman, Liu Jieyi, said 2024 was a critical year for realising goals and tasks set forth in the 14th Five-Year Plan, and this year would be a concluding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The CPPCC National Committee will carry forward our fine traditions, keep in mind our political responsibilities, give full play to the CPPCC's role as a specialised consultative body, serve the overall picture by focusing on the central tasks,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will strengthen theoretical and political guidance, actively produce policy advice, and contribute our ideas and strengths to building a great modern socialist country in all respects, and rejuvenating our nation through Chinese modernisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added that China’s economy maintained steady progress in the past year, and the country also made solid advances in high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As long as we face the challenges, be confident, and follow plans of the Central Committee of the Party, the high-quality development will be able to reach new heights,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic issues are always a priority in the work of the CPPCC National Committee. Over the past year, the National Committee offered advice on a series of important economic issues, and made solid and effective contributions to economic recovery and growth.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu said about 230 CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macau played active roles in the country’s economic and social development, and the CPPCC would continue to help the two SARs integrate into the overall development of the country.

    China factory activity grows at fastest pace in months

<img alt="The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793951_1_20250303101834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery," said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory production accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew five percent last year, reaching the official target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10 percent duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang emphasised the importance of timely policy support, saying "March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee will head to Beijing on Tuesday to attend the annual opening meeting of the National People’s Congress (NPC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The NPC meeting will open in the capital on Wednesday, while the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will open on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee will return to Hong Kong on Thursday, and Chief Secretary Eric Chan will be the acting CE during his absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Executive Council will not hold meetings these two weeks as local NPC and CPPCC members will need to attend the meetings in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport on Monday, a number of local NPC deputies expressed hope for policies supporting private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that in the government work report, there will also be supporting measures to encourage more private enterprises from Hong Kong and around the world to invest in our country," said Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Iris Wong said she was upbeat about the country's potential in tech and cultural industries despite Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone can see that whether it's DeepSeek or the development of robotics, and even the recently popular Ne Zha movie, these are all achievements of our innovation, culture and technology," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member and Liberal Party chairman Peter Shiu said he would continue to push for more Greater Bay Area residents to visit Hong Kong, including expanding the multi-entry visa scheme to eight more cities in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate and lawmaker Johnny Ng, meanwhile, said he would propose mechanisms for fraud prevention education during the meetings in the capital.

    HK to push for greater integration at Two Sessions

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong delegates attending the "Two Sessions" meetings this year said they're looking to make a range of proposals – from the development of artificial intelligence to a low-altitude economy – as the SAR seeks to further integrate into the nation's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Members of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) will be joining the country's largest annual political gatherings in Beijing this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker and local CPPCC member, Johnny Ng, told RTHK that he expects Beijing to put forward initiatives on technology – especially AI – in light of the emergence of DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nowadays we have DeepSeek, this is open source. Open source means different industries can leverage AI to improve their efficiency, like the healthcare industry, the legal industry, the education industry," Ng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I expect and I suggest the government to make a clearer blueprint to every different industry to leverage the benefits of AI... The government should have a clear blueprint and make some funding support."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects cybersecurity to be a key concern for policymakers amid the country's technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker and CPPCC delegate, William Wong, called for the development of a cross-border low-altitude economy, which he sees as key to boosting cooperation in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the development of a low-altitude economy is generally considered more mature on the mainland than in the SAR, Wong believes Hong Kong can play a significant role moving forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The research part can actually be done in Hong Kong, and then the sort of prototyping, the testing part can be done in Shenzhen, for example, because one project is split between two places.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So during the research and development process, there will be a lot of, for example, document transfer. There may be experimental samples transfer or even equipment transfer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stronger cross-border cooperation could also be on the cards when it comes to biotech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the nation's top legislature, Starry Lee, said the Hetao zone is a major technology hub for the SAR, and the city should make good use of it and step up cooperation with the mainland, to help boost the country's overall biotech development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member said the mainland could send its blood products to Hong Kong, so the SAR can capitalise on its advantage in medical research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financing for businesses is another key topic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local NPC deputy, Ronick Chan, said many mainland enterprises, especially those in Qianhai, want to tap the Hong Kong loan market, but it's difficult for them to do so right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  He wants to expand the loan quotas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put in place a total quota in respect of how the Qianhai enterprises could borrow from Hong Kong's financial institutions, and also Hong Kong's companies and enterprises could also borrow from Qianhai's financial institutions. This kind of liberation, I expect, could accelerate the cross-border fund flow and also be beneficial to Hong Kong's loan growth," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other delegates at the "Two Sessions" said they'd like to see more support for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC deputy Stanley Ng wants more mainland tourists to be able to visit Hong Kong via the multi-entry visa scheme, which only covers Shenzhen residents at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the scheme will cover residents in Guangzhou before expanding further to other cities in the Greater Bay Area in future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A local delegate to the country’s top advisory body plans to ask for measures on facilitating people flow within the Greater Bay Area, during the upcoming “Two Sessions” meetings in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Henry Tang, who is a Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member, came up with a number of proposals on better integrating Hong Kong into the country’s development and the Greater Bay Area, as well as leveraging the One Country, Two Systems principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former chief secretary hoped the central government would expand the multiple-entry visa scheme currently in place for Shenzhen residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one “new concept”, as he put it, would be on enriching the financial system on a closed-loop basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s not like I’m proposing to open up a giant back door to undermine the currency controls of the country, but to allow the people in the Greater Bay Area to take much better advantage of the financial instruments available in Hong Kong that are otherwise unavailable to the Shenzhen residents,” he said in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Tang said the latest budget blueprint unveiled by the SAR government had focused on stability, calling it “commendable and reasonable”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you look at it from three basic principles — first is stability, second is development, and third is investing for future — they have all three parts in it,” said Tang, who formerly served as financial secretary himself.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Generally, it is an acceptable budget, in that aspect, and that three years is a reasonably period for a forecast to return to a budget surplus.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In Financial Secretary Paul Chan’s latest budget, he stressed containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.

 China's manufacturing activity grew in February after a dip the previous month, official figures showed on Saturday, as the United States targets the country's exports with increased tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a key measure of industrial output - came in at 50.2 in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), above the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  February's reading was up from 49.1 in January, when factory activity shrank for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production was boosted in February by the "gradual resumption of work by enterprises after the Chinese New Year," said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the services sector, came in at 50.4 in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has admitted the country's economy still faces "numerous difficulties".
  <br>
  <br>
  China's leadership convenes next week for the "Two Sessions" meetings, where analysts expect them to hammer out plans to shield the economy from tariffs and trade threats from the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump this week announced an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said it remained to be seen "how much will the US raise tariff next week, (and) how damaging will it be for China's export orders". (AFP)

 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that Mexico has proposed matching US tariffs on China in a move that he described as "very interesting" and one that Canada should match.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top Mexican officials have met with members of Trump's cabinet this week for trade talks ahead of a March 4 deadline, when US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports are set to get into effect alongside an additional 10 per cent duty on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington said unilateral tariff hikes by the US severely violate World Trade Organization rules and harm interests for China, the US and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressuring, coercion and threat is not the right way to deal with China. Instead, mutual respect is the basic prerequisite," embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement to Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to correct its wrongdoing and return to the right track of addressing each other’s concerns through equal-footed consultations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration has said for months that it is carefully considering Washington and Ottawa's policies towards China, saying even before Trump's re-election that it sought to be "more aligned" in addressing Chinese trade practices. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's space station will welcome its first foreign astronaut in the next few years, after China and Pakistan on Friday signed a cooperation agreement on the selection and training of astronauts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said China and Pakistan would spend roughly a year selecting the Pakistani astronauts, who would be trained in China before joining Chinese counterparts on the Tiangong space station for short-term missions "within the next few years".
  <br>
  <br>
  In the presence of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the agreement was signed by Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office, and Muhammad Yousuf Khan, chairman of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission at the Prime Minister's House.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a country with historically close ties to China, Pakistan has in recent years sought to improve its own space capabilities by participating in Chinese initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last May, Pakistan was one of several countries that placed payloads aboard the Chang'e-6 lunar probe, which ended up making China the first country to successfully retrieve samples from the moon's far side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Completed in late 2022, Tiangong can house a maximum of three astronauts for months at an orbital altitude of up to 450 km.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has a designed operational lifespan of at least 15 years. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Security on Friday voiced firm opposition to the US threat of imposing an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese exports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson made the remarks in response to a media inquiry on the United States' threatened tariff hike, which is scheduled to take effect from March 4 and cited fentanyl issues as the cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said that once again, the United States was using the fentanyl issue as a pretext to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, despite China's stringent anti-drug policies and active international cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has provided support to Washington in addressing the fentanyl issue out of humanitarian concern, achieving notable results, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the root cause of America's fentanyl crisis lies within the US itself, adding that reducing domestic demand and strengthen law enforcement cooperation were the fundamental solutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said the US continued to ignore the core issue of drug demand, unfairly shifting the blame onto other countries, which undermined efforts to solve the problem and harmed China-US cooperation on drug control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing urged the US to preserve the progress in bilateral anti-drug cooperation, and "return to the right path". (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said China's economic fundamentals remain solid despite the difficulties and challenges facing the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi wrote about "properly handling several key relationships in economic work" in an article to be published on Saturday in Qiushi Journal, the flagship magazine of the Communist Party Central Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the unfavourable impact of changes in the external environment has deepened, and China's economy still faces numerous difficulties and challenges," the president wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, it must be recognised that China's economic fundamentals remain solid, with numerous advantages, strong resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The conditions supporting long-term growth and the overall positive trajectory have not changed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Friday, Xi chaired a Politburo meeting discussing a draft government work report to be submitted by the State Council to the upcoming national legislative session for review.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was noted at the meeting that China's economy maintained overall stability and made steady progress in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is also essential to accelerate the forging of a new pattern of development, solidly promote high-quality development, further deepen reform comprehensively, expand high-standard opening up, build a modern industrial system and better coordinate development and security," Xinhua reported.

 The Commerce Ministry on Friday said it opposed US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and vowed to take "all necessary countermeasures" if Chinese entities got caught up in the levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry accused the US of "shifting the blame" on fentanyl flows into the United States and urged Washington to "return to the right track of properly resolving differences through dialogue on an equal footing as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added China had some of the world's strictest anti-drug policies and highlighted the risks new tariffs would bring to global supply chains.
  <br>

  Trump said on Thursday his proposed 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods would take effect on Tuesday, along with the additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed on China earlier this month. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Support for private businesses is a very important area that will be addressed during the upcoming "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, according to Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the first of our series previewing this year's National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) meetings, NPC Standing Committee member Starry Lee said there is an urgency to attract more private investment to China amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protections and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments at or above the county level to provide regular reports on their progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's "set to become China's first fundamental law dedicated to the private sector," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee attended an NPC Standing Committee meeting in the capital this week examining the bill's second draft, ahead of the opening of the NPC session next Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe some of the initiatives will be mentioned in the government report... to further invite and encourage private investment," she said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR has a role to play in trying to shore up support for the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the current geopolitical situation, there is always an urgency to have more private investment to invest in our country, not only from Hong Kong, but from different parts of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being one of the most international cities in our country, we have our responsibility to attract more talent, enterprises and technology to come to Hong Kong to help to build further our financial market and also the technology side."
  <br>
  <br>
  This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, and Lee said people have high expectations for the next blueprint for 2026-2030 which she believes would be related to the resolution adopted in the third party plenary session last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NPC Standing Committee member added that the SAR, the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, as well as the Northern Metropolis will be "key stakeholders" to contribute to the country's development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would impose an added 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports while moving ahead with levies on Canada and Mexico next week, citing "unacceptable" fentanyl smuggling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump had announced – then halted – sweeping 25 percent levies on Canadian and Mexican imports this month over illegal immigration and deadly fentanyl, with Canadian energy to face a lower rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the month-long pause ends next Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following reporters' questions on whether he planned to proceed on the tariffs next week, Trump wrote on social media on Thursday that until the problem of fentanyl stops "or is seriously limited," proposed levies will happen as scheduled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will likewise be charged an additional 10 percent Tariff on that date," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not give further details on how the move interacts with an earlier levy he imposed on Chinese imports over Beijing's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain, or how negotiations with China were proceeding.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has voiced firm opposition to the US decision to impose tariffs on Chinese imports under the pretext of fentanyl-related issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it is one of the countries with the strictest drug control policies and the most rigorous enforcement in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added on Truth Social that an April 2 date for so-called reciprocal tariffs "will remain in full force and effect." (AFP/Xinhua)

 Forty Chinese nationals involved in illegal immigration were repatriated from Thailand on Thursday in a coordinated effort to combat cross-border crime and safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese citizens, according to Ministry of Public Security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The operation, conducted in accordance with Chinese and Thai laws, international regulations and established practices, is one example of ongoing collaboration between the two nations to address transnational criminal activities, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A senior ministry official said the repatriated individuals had been deceived by criminal organisations into illegally crossing borders, ultimately becoming stranded in Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their families have repeatedly sought government assistance for their return," the official said, stressing that the repatriation reflects China's commitment to protecting its citizens' legitimate rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official further emphasised that the repatriated individuals' legal rights were fully protected throughout the process, and that they will receive assistance in re-integrating into their families and society once the necessary legal procedures are completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Recent joint operations between China and Thailand have yielded fruitful outcomes in combating transnational crimes, including telecommunications and internet fraud," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday, the National Immigration Administration said in a statement that the Chinese government firmly opposes illegal immigration in any form. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 About 100 Chinese nationals who engaged in illegal offshore gambling operations in the Philippines have been repatriated to the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Embassy in Manila on Wednesday said law enforcement agencies of the two countries had joined hands to crack down on Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government is committed to cracking down on gambling and relevant crimes and always asks overseas Chinese nationals to strictly abide by local laws and regulations and do not engage in any illegal and criminal activities," it wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the Philippines to completely eradicate the scourge inflicted by offshore gambling as soon as possible. China will continue to work with the Philippines to jointly combat crimes."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines announced a ban on POGOs in July last year, and the operation marked another step towards that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The online gambling industry emerged in the Philippines in 2016, and expanded rapidly as operators leveraged the country's liberal gambling laws to target Chinese customers. Gambling is illegal in China. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four people, including two Chinese nationals, were killed and six injured after a bridge collapsed at an expressway construction site in South Korea on Tuesday, authorities said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Local media aired dramatic footage of what appeared to be a section of the bridge collapsing, sending a massive cloud of smoke into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four people were killed, five were seriously injured and one suffered a minor injury, a statement from the National Fire Agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of those killed, two were Chinese nationals and two were South Koreans, an interior ministry official told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident occurred at around 9.50am in Anseong, around 65 kilometres south of the South Korean capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All individuals who suffered injuries are currently being treated at hospitals," the National Fire Agency's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The National Fire Agency initially said it took place in the nearby city of Cheonan but later corrected that claim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai Engineering, the main contractor of the construction site, apologised and said it was assisting authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We sincerely bow our heads in apology to those who lost their precious lives and were injured in the accident at our construction site," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are actively cooperating with the relevant authorities to ensure a prompt resolution on-site" and to identify the cause of the accident, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting President Choi Sang-mok issued urgent directives to mobilise all available resources and personnel for the rescue operation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland lawmakers on Monday began deliberations on the draft private economy promotion law, which adds new provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  The draft law was submitted on Monday to an ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for a second reading. The first reading took place last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draft bans the forced collection of funds or material donations from private enterprises and specifies that multiple inspection items of the same inspection target should be consolidated whenever possible or included within the scope of cross-departmental joint inspections.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also includes provisions requiring the State Council and local people's governments at or above the county level to regularly report to the standing committees of the people's congresses of their corresponding level on the promotion of the private economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It stipulates that relevant industry associations and chambers of commerce should fulfill their coordinating and self-regulatory roles in accordance with laws, regulations, and their charters. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency quoted the president as saying "China is happy to see Russia and relevant parties make positive efforts to defuse the Ukraine crisis".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China and Russia are good neighbours and true friends supporting each other and achieving common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said their relationship does not target any third party, nor would it be influenced by any third party.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said in a statement that Xi expressed his support for dialogue between the US and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia last week and agreed to start work on restoring bilateral ties and preparing for Ukraine peace talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were set to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (Agencies)

 A mainland court has sentenced four people described as key figures in cross-boundary fraud cases to life in prison.

  <br>
  The Supreme People's Court said the four defendants all left China to form telecom fraud organisations, with one of them, surnamed Yu, organising a number of people to go abroad to commit crimes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement comes as the court released sentences over seven telecom-related fraud cases in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, a mainland actor was rescued from a telecom syndicate in Myanmar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday it will invest more than 380 billion yuan (US$52.4 billion) on artificial intelligence and cloud computing over the next three years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investors have piled into Chinese technology stocks since the start of the year, with Alibaba – which runs some of the country's biggest online shopping platforms – seeing its shares soar to three-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains have been boosted since the Hangzhou-based firm announced robust sales growth last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba plans to "invest at least 380 billion yuan over the next three years to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure", a company statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said its strategy was aimed at "reinforcing (Alibaba's) commitment to long-term technological innovation... (and) underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not detail how the company would allocate the funds or what specific projects would be supported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did add that the investment would exceed its total AI and cloud spending over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba last week reported an 8 percent bump in revenue for the three months through December, beating estimates to reach 280 billion yuan and triggering a 14 percent surge in its Hong Kong shares on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO Eddie Wu said last week that the quarterly results "demonstrated substantial progress in (Alibaba's) 'user-first, AI-driven' strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has responded to accusations made by Australian authorities, saying it had "deliberately hyped" recent Chinese naval exercises near the Australian coast and confirmed its forces had used live fire, in an incident that riled up Canberra.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian on Sunday said the "relevant remarks of the Australian side are completely inconsistent with facts".
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the period, China organised live-fire training of naval guns toward the sea on the basis of repeatedly issuing prior safety notices."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu stressed that China's actions were "in full compliance with international law and international practices, with no impact on aviation flight safety".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Australia, while well aware of this, made unreasonable accusations against China and deliberately hyped it up," Wu added. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A lasting peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved through a two-state solution, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a phone call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, returning from the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, reaffirmed China's support for Arab positions on Palestine and opposition to forced displacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed the importance of a ceasefire and future governance that respects Palestinian autonomy, highlighting the urgency of reconstruction efforts in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister stated that Gaza is a Palestinian territory, and any future arrangement must respect the will of the Palestinian people, adhering to the principle of "Palestinians governing Palestine" in post-conflict governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised the urgent need to develop reconstruction and governance plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Abdelatty provided an update on Egypt's efforts to implement the ceasefire and coordinate a reconstruction plan with other Arab nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Egypt's stance against forced displacement of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China plays a key role, Abdelatty said, adding that Arab countries hoped for China's support in restoring peace and rebuilding Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed Sudan and Syria. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Myanmar handed over more than 100 Chinese scam centre workers to be repatriated through Thailand on Saturday, the third batch in a major crackdown on the illegal operations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of foreigners are expected to be sent home from scam compounds in Myanmar over the coming weeks, with the first two batches already flown out on Thursday and Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds are run by criminal gangs and staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to swindle people around the world in protracted internet scams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myanmar's junta said in a statement that a third group of 111 Chinese nationals was handed over on Saturday via the Thailand-Myanmar Friendship Bridge 2 at the Thai border town of Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Live footage on Thai media outlet The Reporters showed people disembarking from two double-decker coaches and boarding a Southern China Airlines plane, a scene similar to that witnessed on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that the first 50 Chinese nationals boarded a 10:40 am (0340 GMT) flight, with the rest expected to depart on two additional flights throughout the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai described the scam centre problem as a "complex transnational crime."
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as stopping fuel supplies and cutting electricity to suspected scam hubs on the Myanmar side, he had instructed senior Thai police to bolster border control measures, he said in a post on his official Facebook account.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those freed from scam centres say they were duped into working in them and held against their will, but the central government and state media have described them all as "suspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun hailed the "thunder-style cooperation" between China, Myanmar and Thailand to tackle the scam centres. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sensation caused by the mainland blockbuster Ne Zha 2 is very much a "lightning in a bottle-style success" which may not be easy to replicate, according to a local film critic.
 <br>
  <br>
  The animated film, based on the mythological character from Chinese folklore, hits the big screens in Hong Kong on Saturday, after smashing box office records on the mainland and abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what director Yang Yu has done is taking an ancient property, something that every Chinese is intensely familiar with, to fiddle around with it for modern audiences," said Elizabeth Kerr, a Hong Kong-based film critic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://www.rthk.hk/radio/radio3/programme/trendingchina" target="_blank">
   <u>
    RTHK's Trending China programme
   </u>
  </a>
  , she felt the film was a breath of fresh air as the same mythological legends are featured again and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best part about the Ne Zha film is that they're not 'A Journey to the West', they're not 'Monkey King', which I understand that it is beloved ... [But] there's so much more that you can choose from," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a kind of strange territory for overseas viewers, for people who know nothing about any of the culture on this side of the world, it's going to be fresh to them."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sequel to the 2019 hit Ne Zha smashed box office records on the mainland just two weeks after its release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film went on to dethrone Disney's "Inside Out 2" as the highest-grossing animated movie of all time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr believes the sequel's more sophisticated and refined visual effects attributed to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she struck a cautious tone over the film's release in the US market, saying it may not replicate the kind of success seen for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Oscar-winning martial arts epic in 2000.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Partially because Crouching Tiger had a wider release. It also had considerable movie stars in it, and a powerhouse distributor pushing it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she insisted Ne Zha 2's value should not be solely judged by its box office revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2 is one of those things that is very much lightning in a bottle. People will try and repeat it. But you can't force it because how it happened was organic - no one will ever be able to tell you why this worked for this year, at this time, in this country, why it succeeded, no one can."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also hoped Ne Zha's success will encourage mainland filmmakers to experiment with different varieties of scripts, and be willing to "roll the dice" more.

 South Africa on Friday concluded the G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting, after a range of global issues having been discussed.
 <br>
  <br>
  South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola hailed the event as "historic" when briefing the media after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the final day of the summit, Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated China's support  of the free trade system with the World Trade Organization (WTO), and called on the G20 countries to work together to build a just world of common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang met his Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, on the sidelines of the gathering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang recalled the successful meeting between President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kazan, Russia last year, which set the general direction for the improvement and development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, the two sides agreed that China and India, as two ancient civilisations and neighbouring countries, should trust and support each other and help each other succeed. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier He Lifeng expressed concerns over US tariffs and trade restrictions on China during a video call with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on important issues in China-US economic relations, and both parties agreed to keep communicating on matters of mutual concern, according to a readout released by CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, the top trade negotiator on the Chinese side, and Bessent recognised the importance of bilateral economic and trade relations, the readout added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's call came as Beijing and Washington seek to manage their relationship as the world's two largest economies stand on the precipice of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump said earlier this week he expected President Xi Jinping to visit the US, without giving a timeline for his trip.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his G20 counterparts on Thursday that a "window for peace" is opening for the Ukraine crisis, days after top US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top diplomat made the remarks at the G20 ministerial meeting in South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has noted that calls for peace talks have been rising recently, and a window for peace is opening," Wang said, according to a readout of his speech at the G20 meeting in South Africa published by the Foreign Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  At talks in Riyadh on Tuesday, Russia and the United States agreed to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war that began when Russia sent its military into Ukraine on February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  China supports all efforts to achieve peace, including this "recent consensus" reached between the United States and Russia, Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all parties involved can find a sustainable and lasting solution that addresses each other's concerns," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the gathering in Johannesburg, Wang held meetings with his counterparts from multiple countries including Turkey and Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  A curtain-raiser to the G20 summit in November, the meeting was attended by top diplomats, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, his Indian counterpart, as well as European envoys like France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Britain's David Lammy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang has emphasised boosting consumption and improving people's livelihoods through stronger and more targeted measures, in a bid to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in driving economic development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a session held by the State Council, CCTV cited Li saying that, "Boosting consumption is not only an important way to expand domestic demand and stabilise growth, but also a major measure to transform the development model in the mid-to-long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  More efforts should be made to facilitate service consumption, improve the supply of education, medical care, culture, sports, tourism, elderly care and household services, and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence to unlock consumption potential of AI terminal products, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also emphasised the need to relax market access in relevant industries, and boost high-quality product supply to meet emerging consumer demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top policymakers have pledged to try to bolster household incomes and consumption this year. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, to discuss China-Russia relations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, highlighted the strengthening strategic partnership between the two countries, noting significant progress in cooperation and mutual interest, particularly in global multi-polarity.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to work with Russia to fully implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and to further advance China-Russia relations in the new year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov expressed Russia's desire to deepen cooperation in trade, economy, and culture with China and advance their shared goals with Brics, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the United Nations, the G20, and other frameworks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the Ukrainian crisis, Wang reiterated China's consistent stance, emphasising the country's role in promoting peace and political resolution.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lavrov, for his part, said Russia's focus on addressing the root causes of the crisis and its commitment to a fair and sustainable peace in line with the United Nations Charter.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he expects President Xi Jinping to visit the United States, without giving a timeline for his trip.
 <br>
  <br>
  In remarks made to reporters on Air Force One, Trump also said "it's possible" for the two countries to have a new trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2020, the US had already agreed to "a great trade deal with China" and a new deal is possible, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A conversation or interaction between Xi and Trump is seen as crucial to a potential easing or delay of trade tariffs after the US imposed a 10 percent tariff on goods from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi last travelled to the US in November 2023, in his fifth visit to the country as president for a summit with then US president Joe Biden, resulting in agreements to resume military-to-military communications and curb fentanyl production.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll have, ultimately, President Xi, we will have everybody coming," Trump said while also speaking about others leaders visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said he was talking to China about TikTok as the US seeks to broker a sale of the popular app owned by Chinese parent firm ByteDance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders had spoken just before Trump took office on January 20 and discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan. Trump said last week he had spoken to Xi since taking office as well, but did not offer details on the topics of that conversation. (Reuters/AFP)

 Myanmar on Thursday handed over the first batch of hundreds of Chinese scam centre workers who are set to be repatriated through Thailand in the coming days.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of foreigners are expected to be freed and returned from scam compounds in Myanmar in the coming weeks, starting with 600 Chinese over the next three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  The compounds run by criminal gangs are staffed by foreigners, many of whom say they were trafficked and forced to work running internet scams swindling people around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of those involved are Chinese and Beijing has stepped up pressure on Myanmar and Thailand to shut the centres down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Karen Border Guard Force, a militia allied with the Myanmar junta, has said it is preparing to deport 10,000 people linked to the compounds in areas it controls on the border with Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two double-decker coaches delivered a first round of returning workers to the border post in the western Thai town of Mae Sot on Thursday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First group of 50 Chinese have crossed to Thailand and headed to the airport. There will be three more batches (today), each with 50 Chinese," a local border task force official has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has put on 16 flights over the next three days to ferry 600 of its nationals home direcly from Mae Sot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The release follows several visits by Public Security Assistant Minister Liu Zhongyi to Bangkok and the border in recent weeks to arrange the repatriation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scam centres have proliferated across Southeast Asia in recent years, including in Cambodia and the Philippines, as the value of the industry has boomed to billions of US dollars a year. (AFP)

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

<img alt="Beijing and local officials held a forum on the latest amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA).

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing commerce official on Wednesday pledged further support for Hong Kong under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), the city's free-trade deal with the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Shijie, the director-general of the Commerce Ministry's Department of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, told a forum that the central government is committed to backing the city's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will, under the CEPA framework, continue to promote opening up and cooperation with Hong Kong, and support Hong Kong to better integrate into national development," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support different departments in implementing preferential measures under CEPA, and will continue to strengthen opening up and cooperation under the agreement to support investors in Hong Kong and around the world to enter the mainland via Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  An agreement signed last year between the two sides to amend the framework on trade in services under CEPA will come into effect next month. Changes include removing or loosening restrictions on equity shareholding and business scope across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maggie Wong, Hong Kong's permanent secretary for commerce and economic development, said the changes are beneficial to sectors such as financial services, telecommunications, and tourism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government will make the trade make good use of a number of preferential measures, and will continue to seek to jointly promote a higher level of opening up and closer economic and trade cooperation with the mainland on the basis of CEPA, so as to maximise the space of development for the trade on the mainland," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration must take measures to defend free trade amid challenges posed by unilateralism and protectionism, the official added.

    'Ne Zha 2' to hit HK cinemas on Saturday

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Record-breaking blockbuster "Ne Zha 2" is set for general release in Hong Kong on Saturday, as it dethroned Disney's "Inside Out 2" and became the highest grossing animated film of all time -- based on domestic ticketing data.
 <br>
  <br>
  It premiered in the city on Tuesday night, after it garnered significant attention in the SAR over the past month, which saw the animated movie break records for the number of distributors and daily screenings for a mainland film in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are honoured to bring this world-class phenomenon-level animation to Hong Kong and Macau, allowing viewers to experience the charm of Ne Zha in the theatres," said a representative of Emperor Motion Pictures, which is a co-distributor of the film.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some local fans went to Shenzhen to see the animation, ahead of its SAR release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen online comments about the animated film, saying it is a good and touching movie with an excellent storyline that's enlightening for viewers," said a Hongkonger who viewed the movie across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I specifically watched the first movie in Hong Kong and came today to watch its sequel here in Shenzhen, as it hasn't been screened in Hong Kong. I want to see what makes this animation so successful in attracting many adults and to learn about the latest development of Chinese animation."
  <br>
  <br>
  A sequel to the 2019 hit "Ne Zha 1", "Ne Zha 2" has already packed out cinemas in China, where it claimed the title of the nation's biggest box-office hit since its release last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media, citing ticketing platform, Maoyan, said on Tuesday the fantasy epic had raked in over 12.32 billion yuan (US$1.72 billion), which surpassed "Inside Out 2" that took US$1.7 billion following its release last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ne Zha 2" tells the tale of a rebellious young deity who uses his powers to battle formidable foes after his village is destroyed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The film was released overseas this month, sparking hopes that it would garner similar acclaim abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The original "Ne Zha" became what was then China's highest-grossing animated film, after it was released in 2019.

    China condemns US 'tariff shocks' at WTO

<div class="itemFullText">
 The sweeping tariffs threatened or imposed by US President Donald Trump risk triggering inflation, market distortions, and even a global recession, China said on Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
 <br>
  <br>
  After returning to office on January 20, Trump slapped China, the world's second-biggest economy, with an additional 10 percent levy on products entering the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump signed executive orders last week imposing new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world faces a series of tariff shocks," said Li Chenggang, China's ambassador to the WTO, at the first meeting of the year of the global trade body's decision-making General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has imposed or threatened tariffs on its trading partners, including China, unilaterally and arbitrarily, blatantly violating WTO rules. China firmly opposes such measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariff shocks heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li went on to say that US unilateralism threatened to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stakes are high for all members, big or small," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imposing punitive tariffs on countries with high trade surpluses with the United States has been at the heart of Trump's economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He paused 25 percent levies against Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump went ahead with tariffs on China, which imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting US coal and liquified natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Geneva-based trade official said Washington in return voiced concerns that China was operating a non-market economic system and habitually breached WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US highlighted the issues stemming from China's lack of transparency and its disregard for WTO oversight," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US also pointed out that the WTO's current inability to address China's market-distorting policies, such as unfair subsidies, significantly diminishes the organisation's effectiveness." (AFP)

 China hopes that all parties and stakeholders can participate in the peace talks to solve the Ukraine crisis, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing welcomes all peace efforts over Ukraine, including the talks between the United States and Russia, ahead of a meeting between diplomats from the two countries in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump is pushing for a swift resolution to the three-year conflict in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not invited to the discussions in Riyadh, while European leaders were gathering in Paris for emergency talks on how to respond to the radical pivot by the new US administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo said: "We hope that all parties can work together to resolve the root causes of the Ukraine crisis, find a balanced, effective and sustainable security structure and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The so-called "update" to the Taiwan fact sheet displayed on the US State Department website is another example of Washington using the Taiwan question to contain China, and China urges the US to immediately correct its mistakes, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department removed a line on its website stating that it does not support "Taiwan independence".
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo reiterated that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the whole of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it is a prevailing international consensus and basic norm governing international relations, and also a solemn commitment the US has made in the three China-US joint communiqués.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo stressed that the revision made by the US State Department gravely backpedalled on its position on Taiwan-related issues, and has sent a severely wrong signal to "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US to immediately correct its wrongdoings, abide by the one-China principle and three China-US joint communiqués," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, urged the US to handle the Taiwan question with the "greatest prudence" and stop sending any wrong signals that condone or abet "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revision was a "severe regression" regarding the US stance on the Taiwan question, she added. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called for efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of China's private sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks when attending a symposium on private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said the private sector enjoys broad prospects and great potential on the new journey in the new era, and it is a prime time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to give full play to their capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for efforts to reach consensus and firming up confidence, to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all private enterprises and private entrepreneurs will have the ambition to serve the country, strive for development, operate in accordance with the law and promote common prosperity, so as to make new and greater contributions to promoting Chinese-style modernisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that policies regarding the private sector would not change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president delivered the speech after listening to representatives of private companies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang were among those attending the symposium, which was presided over by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Huning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment, a meeting which would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A special event in the United States has been shining a spotlight on the achievements of Asian American women, in areas ranging from academics to sports.
 <br>
  <br>
  The awards gala for the Outstanding Asian American Women Who Dared – held in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley on February 13 – recognised 12 people, who said the event comes at a crucial time, especially with US President Donald Trump aggressively moving to stamp out traces of diversity, equity and inclusiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re entering a very special era in history, and it just makes us have to really step in and step up and work harder,” honouree Liu Xin – the founder of the Enlight Foundation, which focuses on education equality and helping youth engage in developing climate solutions – said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A presenter at the show, Fiona Ma, is the first Asian American Woman to be elected treasurer of California.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s been very difficult for me being an Asian woman moving up the ranks and politics. And, you know, tonight is about recognising other trailblazers and people who are really making a mark.”
  <br>
  <br>
  And one of those making a mark is Sue Xu, the managing partner of venture capital firm Amino Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has contributed to the success of at least 45 companies with a total value of more than US$100 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has also addressed the United Nations about the role of artificial intelligence in combatting human trafficking and promoting the welfare of women.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel like, woman's voice hasn’t been heard. Especially nowadays, when you're talking about DeepSeek, talking about AI. And then I feel like a lot of times woman is victims of AI. And then, you know, South Korea, they just passed that out, criminalising possession for, you know, deep-fake pornography. I feel like as a woman, if we lead with responsibility, we have a chance,” Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many of the honourees stem from the world of business and technology, artists were celebrated too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honouree Chen Jiebing is one of the foremost erhu virtuosos in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai native has been nominated for a Grammy and recently had the honour of Nasa using her music to celebrate its 60th anniversary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I want the world to see and hear the unique vocal expressions of this instrument and it’s versatility to incorporate with other Western styles of music such as jazz, and even American Blue Grass country style music.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like all the honourees, Chen has daring goals. Hers is to someday elevate the erhu to be as widely recognised worldwide as the violin.

 China urged Nato to adopt a "rational and pragmatic" attitude and establish an "objective and correct understanding" of China, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi made the comment to Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte on Friday, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing will continue to work with other parties to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier at the conference, the top diplomat said China will work with like-minded countries to promote a stable and orderly multi-polar world as well as an inclusive and tolerant economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted that China maintains a consistent and stable policy toward the United States, which will continue to be guided by the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Thailand said they arrested 10 Chinese nationals in connection with the case involving Chinese actor Wang Xing and have handed them over to the immigration department for repatriation to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement released by the Thai police, investigations found that the 10 arrested belonged to a criminal gang that had long been conducting telecommunications fraud targeting Chinese citizens in Myawaddy, Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were accused of pretending to be employees of an entertainment company in Thailand to defraud Wang Xing. After Wang's rescue, they attempted to flee to Cambodia via Thailand, but were arrested in various locations near the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thatchai Pitaneelaboot, senior inspector general of the Thai police, said he's instructed for the 10 suspects to be handed over to the Thai Immigration Bureau for repatriation to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Xing, a Chinese actor, entered Thailand on January 3 but lost contact near the Thailand-Myanmar border. Thai police tracked his movements and successfully carried out a rescue operation, identifying Wang as a victim of human trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand said Wang has since returned to China following joint efforts from both countries. (Xinhua)
