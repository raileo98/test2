<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this year, including 506,804 units sold in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90 percent of its total sales, stood at 17.1 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comparison, Volkswagen's two joint ventures with SAIC and FAW Group took a combined 11 percent market share in the January-November period, compared with 14.2 percent last year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs from a second Donald Trump White House while dealing with other headwinds, suggesting more policy stimulus could be needed to shore up growth. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.

  <br>
  Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

  "The Chinese government has actively assisted Chinese citizens who are willing to leave Syria in a safe and orderly way, and has maintained contact with... Chinese citizens who remain in Syria," the ministry said.

  "We urge the relevant Syrian parties to take practical measures to ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria," it added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 US military firms in response to the sale of American weapons to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move followed Beijing's strong objection to Washington authorising a potential US$385 million sale of spare parts and support for radars and F-16 fighter jets to the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said the move undermines its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also cover six top executives at some of the companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned companies would have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives would be barred from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday also urged Washington to "stop sending the wrong signals" after US House Speaker Mike Johnson had a phone call with Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to emphasise once again that the Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first red line that may not be crossed in Sino-U.S. relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has condemned Washington for allowing Lai to stop over in both Hawaii and Guam during a visit to the Pacific. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spring Festival has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by the UN's culture agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) made the decision on Wednesday, noting that the festival promotes family values, societal cohesion and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spring Festival, a tradition dating back thousands of years, marks the start of the new year in the Chinese calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unesco said the festival incorporates social customs to welcome the new year, seek blessings for good fortune, celebrate family reunions and promote community harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Minister of Culture and Tourism Rao Quan expressed gratitude for Unesco's recognition, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rao stressed that the Spring Festival stands as China's most important traditional festival, embodying Chinese people's aspirations for a better life and strong ties with family and the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this addition, China now has a total of 44 items on Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, the highest number in the world.

 Workers and residents near a construction site in Shenzhen had to evacuate their homes and workplaces following a sudden ground collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen people remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at 11pm on Wednesday at a construction site in the city's Bao'an District, prompting local authorities to cordon off streets hundreds of metres away from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby residents and workers were seen evacuating their homes and factories, with some saying they were asked to do so at about noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, who was leaving with her pet, said she was not sure when could she return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They asked us not to stay here and asked us to evacuate. They think it's not safe here and asked us to move elsewhere," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A worker said there was no arrangement of accommodation from his employer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has to evacuate... I don't know how to describe my feelings now. I can't work and also I have to pay and live elsewhere," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another worker said he was working at a nearby site when the collapse happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was working and the electricity supply was suddenly cut off... We're moving out due to safety concerns, and we have to wait for further announcement from the company," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An all-out rescue has been launched and an investigation into the accident is underway, state media reported.

    China urges the Philippines to stop its provocations

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Wednesday warned Manila to stop its infringements, provocations and actions, saying that a Philippine vessel intentionally rammed into a CCG ship around the Huangyan Dao, also known as the Scarborough Shoal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, the Philippines will be held accountable for all consequences arising from this," CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the CCG said the Philippines deployed coast guard vessels, official ships and fishing boats into waters around Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea as the Chinese fleet responded in accordance with the law and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG said that Philippine ships "came dangerously close", adding that a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings, made a sharp turn, reversed and deliberately rammed into a CCG ship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added the Philippine side was the party at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines said the CCG had fired water cannon and "sideswiped" a government vessel during a maritime patrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manila also released a video appearing to show a Chinese coast guard ship firing a jet of water at the Philippines fisheries department vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG accused Manila of making "bogus accusations in an attempt to mislead international understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  China said Huangyan Dao has always been its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated last month when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships, prompting China to summon the Philippine ambassador.
  <br>
  <br>
  And ties frayed further when the Philippines and the United States signed a security deal allowing both sides to share classified information. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement that cited national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to "stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses", the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States," Beijing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States "abuses export control measures" and has "hindered normal economic and trade exchanges".
  <br>
  <br>
  And on Tuesday, China said Washington had "politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues" as it unveiled its own export curbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves also restrict the exports of "dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes", Beijing said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China lifted trade restrictions on two Australian meat processing facilities, allowing the full resumption of red meat exports to the country, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has now removed restrictions from all 10 Australian abattoirs it banned between 2020 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bans were imposed around the time that China blocked imports of commodities including coal, barley and wine from Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all those restrictions have been removed since a new government won power in Canberra in 2022, with trade in lobster, the final banned product, set to restart by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is great news for Australian exporters, producers and farmers," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we were elected we've worked tirelessly to resume trade and that's exactly what we are seeing. It's a win for trade and a win for Australian jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the second largest market for Australian beef and veal after the United States, receiving around 200,000 metric tonnes a year worth around US$1.5 billion in recent years, Australian trade data showed. (Reuters)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said anti-subsidy tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles violated the principles of fair competition and free trade during talks with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in Beijing on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China urged Germany and Europe to view its development objectively and rationally, adopt an active and pragmatic policy towards China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baerbock, for her part, said Germany supports the continuation of negotiations between China and the EU to try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  On China-Germany ties, Wang said Beijing has always regarded Berlin as an important partner, and that differences between the two countries should not become obstacles to cooperation or lead to confrontation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister added that their relationship does not target any third party, and should not be subject to influence by any third party. (Reporting by Xinhua)

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has pledged to work with Hong Kong in leveraging the advantages of the two SARs to foster development.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On whether we and Hong Kong could complement each other's strengths and foster mutual development, I think there's huge potential in this," Sam said in a press conference on Sunday flanked by his incoming cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will meet with Chief Executive John Lee after he assumes office on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After I take office, I'll talk to Chief Executive John Lee about how the two SARs can – on each side of the Pearl River and under our common constitutional and political system – fully leverage our respective advantages to foster development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll also look at how we can leverage our strengths and seek opportunities, while integrating into the nation's development, as we strive for achievements for both SARs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam and his governing team met the media a day after Beijing approved his nominations and appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The formation of this government's principal officials and prosecutor-general embodies the spirit of 'upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground', which completely aligns with the requirements I set out for principal officials," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming Macau leader added his government will respond to issues the public is most concerned about, and work on key tasks relating to the city's long-term development.

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

 The Foreign Ministry said three Chinese nationals jailed in the United States have returned to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's after the White House said three Americans jailed in China were released and heading back to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following unremitting efforts by the Chinese government, three Chinese nationals wrongfully imprisoned by the American side have now safely returned to the motherland," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Beijing "consistently opposes the American side carrying out the suppression and persecution of Chinese nationals out of political aims, and will continue as ever to take necessary measures" to uphold their interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao added a longtime "fugitive" was also extradited back to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Washington said it secured the return of three Americans classified by the US State Department as wrongfully detained.

 The White House said three Americans jailed in China have been released and were heading back to the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trio – Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung – had been considered by Washington to be wrongfully detained by Beijing. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to all three. "I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they'll soon be reunited with their loved ones," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Politico, which first reported the release, said a number of Chinese citizens detained in the US would also be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's embassy in Washington did not comment on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US has upgraded its travel advisory for China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department changed its travel warning to China to level 2, advising US citizens to “exercise increased caution” when travelling to the country. It had previously been at level 3, telling Americans to “reconsider travel”. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 State media shrugged off US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing him of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, said on Monday that he would impose "an additional 10 percent tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation, after Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is far-fetched," China Daily said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the US lies with the US itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in tariff wars. If the US continues to politicise economic and trade issues by weaponising tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday also pledged 25 percent tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had a "good" conversation with Trump immediately following the president-elect's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth," as well as "some of the challenges that we can work on together," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian leader has assembled a team of ministers to lobby US lawmakers and members of Trump's inner circle, a repeat of a charm offensive during his first term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested on Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues but said drugs were a US problem. (Agencies)

    China 'open to dialogue' after Trump tariff threat

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it remains "open to dialogue" with the United States after president-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, after being asked whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US said "no one will win a trade war" after Trump said he intends to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman said in an email to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a series of posts to his Truth Social account on Monday, Trump vowed to hit some of Washington's largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another post, Trump said he would be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canberra, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said on Tuesday that the US policy on trade with China and other countries would have an impact on relations between China and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "US policy on trade with China, with other countries as well, will have an impact and that is an important element that we have to consider," Xiao told a press conference in Canberra, in response to a question on whether potential tariffs by Trump would impact China and Australia's bilateral relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada described its trade relationship with the US "mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration," said a statement from Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favourable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. (Agencies)

 The director of the central government's liaison office on Monday urged Hong Kong and Guangdong to work together to bring positive developments for the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Deepening Economic, Trade and Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, Zheng Yanxiong said Hong Kong's economy and society have seen improvements with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the SAR and Guangdong could lead the GBA on the development of innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Guangdong and Hong Kong can make good use of the advantages of the innovation and industrial chains of the GBA, focusing on emerging fields like artificial intelligence, life sciences, low-altitude economy and green development," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two places should accelerate the cultivation and creation of new industries, and develop new quality productive forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming said the GBA has unlimited prospects, with the size of the economy reaching over 10 trillion yuan last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can improve together with Guangdong, making use of different advantages, with Hong Kong serving as a super-connector and a super value-adder, and helping Guangdong and Hong Kong go global together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who is leading a delegation of government officials and business leaders on a visit to the GBA, also attended the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong and Guangdong reached agreement on 126 economic and trade cooperation projects totalling more than 100 billion yuan at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of these projects, 101 involve Hong Kong businesses investing in Guangdong, with a total value exceeding 91 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They cover areas like financial cooperation, modern logistics, smart productions, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the love for the country and family as well as practical actions by Hong Kong entrepreneurs in actively serving the development of Guangdong and the mainland," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation arrived in Foshan on Monday night on the next leg of their visit. Lee will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, with Chief Secretary Eric Chan continuing to lead the delegation that will also visit Dongguan, Huizhou and Shenzhen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports are legitimate trade remedies fully in line with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said in a statement: "By requesting consultations with China over its provisional anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, the Commission is following through on its commitment to protect our industry from unfounded accusations and misuse of trade defence measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to a media query on the consultation request filed by the EU over these measures through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, a Commerce Ministry official said the Chinese side will handle it in accordance with the WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Beijing to impose anti-dumping measures last month came after the EU slapped additional import tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. China has filed its own complaint with the WTO over the new tariffs on electric vehicles. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it hopes Japan will work towards improving people exchanges between the two countries, after Beijing announced a visa-free arrangement for Japanese citizens last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We certainly hope that the Japanese side will join us... to enhance the level of facilitation of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a regular briefing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the facilitation of people-to-people exchanges."
  <br>
  <br>
  China will expand its visa-free arrangements to include Japan and eight other countries, including Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, from November 30, 2024, to December 31, 2025, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's part of ongoing efforts to boost international tourism and business travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will also extend the visa-free stay period to 30 days from 15 days for citizens of all 38 countries within its visa-free programme. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in helping companies in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) go global.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Listed Companies Summit, Chan described the GBA as a developed economy, and said companies in the area are vital for the country's opening-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR, as an international financial centre, can help create more opportunities and add value for GBA companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the geopolitical haze, mainland companies are facing unprecedented challenges when they raise funds in the Western markets. Hong Kong will reform the financial market in response to the situation to gather more domestic and overseas funds to support projects and companies in the GBA," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as they are beneficial to companies, the development of Hong Kong's financial market, and the development of the country, we will actively study and push forward the policies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi Bin, deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, said there are 5,000 listed companies in the GBA, and they help promote cooperation in areas like finance, economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope listed companies in the GBA could actively make use of Hong Kong's advantages, and treat the city as a base for overseas expansion. While consolidating the American and Western markets, we should work together and expand into emerging markets like the Asean, Middle East and Latin America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee, meanwhile thanked the country for supporting the city's development as an international financial centre, international aviation hub and offshore renminbi hub.

    Govt-market integration key for Hetao: Sun Dong

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry on Sunday said government backing and an efficient market are both necessary, if plans to expand a Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech zone were to succeed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong's comments came days after officials unveiled the development outline for the SAR section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the development now covers twice the gross floor area compared to the original scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said he explained to his friends in Shanghai what Hetao is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them today's Northern Metropolis is like Shanghai's Pudong district in the old days, and that Hetao is equivalent to Pudong's Oriental Pearl," he recalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They immediately understood that this is extremely important for Hong Kong's future development."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added mainland officials faced similar challenges when they developed Pudong in the 1990s. But they made it happen, even with a limited budget, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US president-elect Donald Trump's tech restrictions on China and how it might affect Hong Kong, Sun said the city should work more closely with the mainland and strengthen its own technology infrastructure to cope with the complex global environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The innovation chief also called on local tech companies to procure supplies and equipment from different sources, instead of relying too much on a single market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said China is ready to engage in dialogue and manage differences with the United States to promote steady and sustained development of bilateral economic ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's also the China International Trade Representative, told a press conference on Friday that the world's two-largest economies are highly complementary as he emphasised the importance of their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to a reporter's question about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose 60 percent tariffs on imports from China, he said that would "not solve the country’s own trade deficit problem”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it leads to higher prices for imported products and inflation, with the burden ultimately falling on consumers," Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that China's total foreign trade including imports and exports reached 36 trillion yuan in January-October, up about 5 percent from the same period of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Friday's press conference, Wang and other officials outlined ways that China is promoting expanding trade and support for coping with climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such measures include streamlining customs and visa requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  China allows visa-free travel for citizens of 29 countries, including France and Germany, and the number of foreign visitors, which plunged during the pandemic, has jumped this year. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country's biggest internet forum concluded its four-day session in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Friday, with more than 1,800 guests from over 130 countries taking part.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech representatives and government ministers meet annually in the town for the World Internet Conference, which focused this year on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the conference, the World Internet Development report 2024 was issued, reviewing China’s internet development over the past three decades and projecting future directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the evolution of global cyberspace governance and stressed the need for international consensus on AI and data issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some attendees about what they hoped the summit will achieve.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the participants, City University’s deputy president Ray Cheung, said he wants more teaching collaboration within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “City University already established our Dongguan campus and 80 percent of the faculty that are teaching courses in Dongguan is actually coming from Hong Kong. So what we are seeing is a lot of synergies actually developing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we see Hong Kong as the global international education hub is taking a very important role for the GBA as well as the global education development.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Stanford neuroscientist and researcher Walter Greenleaf, said he hope to see some agreements to address looming healthcare crises after the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned from the pandemic that what happens in one spot can impact another spot. So I think as healthcare providers, as developers of healthcare technology, we need to transcend borders and just make sure that we realise that as people, as part of the world, we are in a great position to help each other."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

    US martial arts master harnesses AI to teach kung fu

<div class="itemFullText">
 From a small town in America to China's Wudang Mountains, Tai Chi master Jake Pinnick says he finds artificial intelligence increasingly useful for teaching kung fu and translating traditional Chinese texts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The martial arts practitioner from Illinois, who has lived in China since 2010, is the 16th-generation disciple of the Wudang San Feng lineage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK during the ongoing World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Pinnick said he wanted to share his experience of using the internet to connect with students worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have classes with people in different countries, different time zones, and so really I just came here to share my experience with that hoping that there's more opportunity for connection," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit is themed around the use of AI and building a digital future for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kung fu coach said technological breakthroughs were a great help when it came to teaching martial arts on the mountains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, training martial arts, there's only so much that it can really help with as far as the martial arts side, like maybe with organising videos or adding subtitles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pinnick added that AI-powered tools can identify language, such as traditional Chinese text which can be difficult to translate, helping him to organise ideas faster and broadcast them to more people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the tech rivalry between China and the US, Pinnick said he believed it was a healthy competition that would lead to better communication tools and more connections between countries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

    AI plays big role in peacekeeping: Unesco

<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    Macau's made good progress over the years: Ho Iat-seng

<img alt="Macau's outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng says people should not see the two SARs as rivals. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779957_1_20241119213646.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau’s outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, on Tuesday said he’s basically accomplished all of the promises set out in his election manifesto five years ago, adding that the gaming hub has made great strides in many areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters for the first time since his announcement not to seek re-election, Ho said his administration had to overcome many challenges during his five-year tenure – including the Covid pandemic that lasted three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, he said Macau's economy expanded and measures were also put in place to better safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the stress and a prolonged lack of rest over the years had taken a toll on his health, and he believes it's now time to pass the baton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also confirmed that the Macau government will continue to dish out MOP 10,000 to permanent residents and MOP 6,000 to non-permanent residents next year, saying his successor, Sam Hou-fai, agrees with the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the outgoing Macau CE noted that he hopes Macau and Hong Kong can continue to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Macau has always been learning from Hong Kong, saying the city has made substantial progress in areas like finance, maritime and aviation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Hong Kong's development as a mega events hub, Ho said people should not see the two SARs as rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Hong Kong and Macau has the vibe for mega events. We are developing this together... We invite different international singers to perform, and both places have the vibe to host concerts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next term of the Macau government should also work closely with Hong Kong because the relationship between the two places is very good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho's successor, former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai, is due to take office on December 20.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says foreign criticism of court sentences handed down on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far tramples on the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said no one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape legal punishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also said Beijing firmly supports Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consulate in Hong Kong said Washington strongly condemns the sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia said it was gravely concerned about the fate of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng, who was jailed for seven years and three months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?

    <br>
    <br>
    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.

     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

    'Improve grazing practices to save giant wild pandas'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

    'China to build more Belt and Road transport networks'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

 President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday vowed to work with the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged," following the election, Xi said, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Xi that the two leaders haven't always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said the two countries' relationship would make "considerable progress" when both nations "treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, according to a simultaneous translation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come two months before Trump assumes office. (Reuters)

 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

    President Xi inaugurates new Peru megaport

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    China's Zeekr to take control of sister brand Lynk
   </title>

<img alt="The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779186_1_20241114204953.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Geely said on Thursday its premium electric vehicle maker Zeekr plans to take control of sister brand Lynk & Co - the first big restructuring move in a planned overhaul for the sprawling automotive group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid," Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Volvo Cars were up 3.5 percent in early trade, among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-listed shares of Zeekr dropped over 7 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeekr will then nudge its stake up to 51 percent with a capital injection while Geely Auto, the group's main listed arm, will continue to own the rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. It should be completed by June next year, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traditional values of family and loyalty are vital for not just many Chinese families, but also overseas Chinese businesses seeking to win the hearts of the people in Peru, the host of this year’s Apec summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation, which is welcoming global leaders to its capital Lima this week, does most of its trade with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is home to around 170 Chinese enterprises, many of which heeded the call by the central government to look for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Chinese presence in Peru dates back to the 19th century. Chinese food is extremely popular in the country, with thousands of Chifas, or restaurants which serve mostly Cantonese dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The term Chifa is believed to have come from the Chinese words “eat rice”, meaning to have a meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from the catering industry, Chinese immigrants also thrive in other sectors, especially manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  That includes Alfredo Chang, who oversees the Calimod group, one of the most recognised footwear brands in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Employing over 600 locals, Chang runs a vast business and knows the production chain inside and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secret to success, he says, is to treat employees like family and gain their loyalty, both of which are traditional Chinese values.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our company culture is that if we treat the workers well, the workers will treat the company well too,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang recalled the difficult times during Covid, when he refused to send workers on no-pay leave even after the government granted employers the right to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had to take out bank loans to tide over the crisis. The bold move has won the hearts of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a result, many employees would turn down offers from other companies, and say, ‘I’m not leaving. This place is like family to me.’ Our company culture is that we are all a family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His son, Thomas, has plans to expand the business to nearby regions such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hopes the Chankay megaport, which is majority owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, can bring down the cost of raw materials imported from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the biggest opportunity for Peru is to really become a hub for South America. Right now with the Chankay port, the lead time from Shanghai to Peru is around 20 days. It's almost half of what is right now, and Chankay is going to be the biggest port on the [South American] Pacific,” he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The freight will be much cheaper, so that will help us probably be more competitive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added South American neighbours such as Brazil should utilise the port and fast-track their shipments to China.

    Xi to hold final talks with Biden in Peru: US official

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping will reportedly be holding talks with his US counterpart Joe Biden on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru, in what’s expected to be their last official talks before Donald Trump takes office.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior Biden administration official briefed reporters about the meeting on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect this will be their last meeting as presidents," the official said. "With that in mind, we expect the president will use the opportunity to take stock of efforts to responsibly manage competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already signaled a confrontational approach with Beijing for his second term, picking a number of outspoken China hawks for key foreign and defense positions in his top team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has also promised to slap 60-percent tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to fears of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration official would not be drawn on whether he would try to advise China on how to deal with Trump – or if he would advise Trump on how to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult, complicated, consequential relationship," the official said. "The president has been pretty clear that he even admits the competitive aspects of the relationship, we need to find ways to manage it responsibly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden heads to Lima on Thursday for the APEC summit on Friday and Saturday for his swansong at the major gathering of Asia-Pacific economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks will be the third meeting between Biden and Xi during Biden's presidency. They met in Woodside, California, last November on the sidelines of the 2023 Apec summit, and the leaders last spoke by phone in April. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping headed to Peru on Wednesday, bound for a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) organisation leaders overshadowed by fears of renewed global trade tensions under US President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will join leaders from the United States and other Asia-Pacific nations in the Peruvian capital Lima for the Apec gathering, after which he will go to Brazil for a G20 summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Peru, Xi will also inaugurate South America's first Chinese-funded port, in Chancay, around 80 kilometres north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting on Wednesday, Lima will receive government ministers and business leaders of Apec member countries, which also include Russia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Chile and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ministerial meetings will take place on Thursday, followed by talks at the level of heads of state the following two days. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping's special representative at the United Nations climate summit has called for a strengthening of early warning systems and enhancing climate adaptation capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang was addressing a high-level meeting held by China on Tuesday, during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, said China attached great importance to international cooperation on meteorological early warnings and that President Xi had made specific requirements on this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Ding proposed three points, including standardising climate risk assessments, building a global early warning network by sharing technology and enhancing interconnectivity, and establishing a climate adaptation partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China would develop a South-South cooperation flagship project for early warning in response to climate change, and support developing countries with meteorological observation equipment, early warning systems, and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere at the summit, scientists said global carbon dioxide emissions, including those from burning fossil fuels, would hit a record high this year, pulling the world further off course from averting more destructive climate extremes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Carbon Budget report, published during the climate summit, said global CO2 emissions are set to total 41.6 billion metric tons in 2024, up from 40.6 billion tons last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report forecast that emissions in China would marginally increase by 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report's authors said China's emissions from oil use have likely peaked, as electric vehicles gain market share. (Agencies)

    'Hardworking and honest': China-Peru ties run deep

<img alt="Part of the society’s headquarters feels like a museum, filled with photos, medals and trophies collected over the past decades. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778760_2_20241113033156.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Peru is keen to deepen its strategic partnership with China when it hosts President Xi Jinping for the Apec summit in Lima this week, while the Peruvian Chinese community says they are highly regarded by the locals because of their law-abiding and hardworking nature.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner, accounting for 53 percent of all exports from the South American nation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Trade Development Council in Hong Kong show that trade between the two nations exceeded US$20 billion in the first half of this year, nearly reaching the full-year total of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ties between China and Peru can be traced back to the 19th century, when the first batch of Chinese workers arrived at the shores of the South American nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Loo moved from Hong Kong to Peru in 1979, when he was just 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is now the president of Sociedad Central de Beneficencia China – which roughly translates as the Chinese Benevolent Society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was founded in 1886 by a Qing dynasty official, and is steeped in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo said the earliest Chinese immigrants worked as hard labour, after slavery was outlawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they gradually raised their social status, and now the Chinese are highly regarded in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have our ancestors to thank for this. They have always been model citizens. In the eyes of Peruvians, Chinese people are hardworking, honest and clever,” he told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s how locals see us, and that’s why Chinese Peruvians are able to achieve in different sectors such as business, and politics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Today it is estimated that about 10 percent of the Peruvian population has Chinese origins.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society, which has lent a helping hand to countless immigrants over the years, is moving with the times by switching its focus to promoting – and preserving – Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lion dance troupe with more than 200 teenagers. Half of them are Peruvians and the other half are Chinese. Their performances are very well received by the locals – you’ll see us in festivals, events and opening ceremonies. Apart from promoting Chinese culture, the troupe also galvanises the Chinese community here and foster exchanges with Peruvians,” Loo explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has been recognised by the Chinese embassy in Peru for its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been invited to take part in Beijing’s foreign aid programme, dishing out emergency funds to Chinese citizens who encounter unexpected situations or accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tour of the society’s headquarters in Chinatown, Loo showed RTHK group photos featuring Xi, when he last visited Peru in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to it was another photo with former president Hu Jintao, taken in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo can look forward to a third group photo, when he and other Chinese Peruvian representatives greet the president again, later this week.

<img alt="This year, larger ticket household appliances performed better than last year, including energy-efficient air conditioners, robot vacuum cleaners and smart toilets, per JD.com.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group said it recorded "robust growth" in sales and a "record number" of shoppers over this year's Singles' Day sales period, a weeks-long event that ended at midnight on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm did not release total sales revenue for the period but said 45 brands - including Apple, Haier, Midea and Xiaomi - each surpassed 1 billion yuan in gross merchandising value (GMV), a commonly used measurement for online sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  JD.com, China's second biggest e-commerce company, did not disclose information about sales but reported a more than 20 percent year-over-year increase in shoppers over the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data provider Syntun estimated that sales across major e-commerce platforms rose 26.6 percent to 1.44 trillion yuan over the Singles Day event, which was 10 days longer than last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on November 11 each year in China, the Singles' Day festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year's festival, which kicked off on October 14, is the longest edition yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, larger ticket household appliances performed better than last year, benefiting from a national 150 billion yuan trade-in subsidy scheme announced in July to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to JD.com, fast-growing home and appliance categories included energy-efficient air conditioners, robot vacuum cleaners and smart toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another consumer sector seeing unexpected growth was collectible toys and hobbies, a category that includes anime, comic and gaming-related goods popular with young people in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from Alibaba, designer and collectible toy brands including MiHoYo, Pop Mart, Paperpresented and Jellycat surpassed 100 million yuan in GMV. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai on Tuesday said 35 people were killed and another 43 were injured when a car ploughed into people exercising around a sports centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  A suspect has been taken into custody, and President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to treat the injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police said that a "serious and vicious attack" occurred at Zhuhai Sports Centre on Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a man drove an SUV through the gate and forced his way into the sports centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old suspect was subdued as he tried to flee the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they found him cutting himself with a knife, before they stopped him and sent him to hospital, where he is currently in a coma after self-inflicted injuries to his neck and other parts of his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said preliminary investigations suggested that the actions of the driver "stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the property division outcome of his divorce".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi gave instructions on the case and demanded that the perpetrator be severely punished according to the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also urged authorities to do more to ensure safety and protect people's lives and social stability. (Xinhua/AFP)
