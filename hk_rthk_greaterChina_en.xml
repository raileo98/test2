<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday he hopes the incoming Trump administration would "make the right choice" and work with Beijing, hours after Donald Trump told reporters the Covid-19 pandemic had strained his relationship with "friend" President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the new US administration will make the right choice and work with China in a mutually-beneficial manner to remove disruptions and overcome obstacles," the foreign minister told a forum in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the two countries can achieve "many great things" if they work together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also warned against "crude interference" by the US on the issue of Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a very good relationship until Covid," Trump told reporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday when asked whether Xi would attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Covid didn't end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me."

<img alt="Relaxing its visa-free transit policy could further boost visits to China by foreign nationals. File photo: Imaginechina via AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783805_1_20241217111535.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced a relaxation of its visa-free transit policy, extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers to 240 hours, or 10 days, from 72 to 144 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as the country tries to attract more visitors, boosting post-pandemic travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective immediately, 21 additional ports have been designated for visa-free entry and exit, and the areas in which transit travellers can stay have been expanded, according to a statement from National Immigration Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the updated policy, eligible citizens from 54 countries, including Russia, Brazil, Britain, the United States and Canada, can enter China visa-free when transiting to a third country or region.
  <br>
  <br>
  These travellers may now enter through any of the 60 ports across 24 provinces, regions and municipalities, and stay within the designated areas for up to 240 hours. Cross-regional travel is being introduced, allowing foreign visitors to move freely across the 24 specified provincial-level regions during their 10-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  China recorded nearly 29.22 million inbound foreign visits in the first 11 months of 2024, up 86.2 percent year on year. Of these, 17.45 million entered the country visa-free, more than doubling the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since reopening its borders in 2023, Beijing has waived visa requirements for travellers to encourage visitation to the world's second largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the Foreign Ministry said China had extended its visa-free policy to a total of 38 countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will decide whether and when to conduct military exercises in accordance with its needs and the situation on the ground, a defence spokesperson said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks when responding to media questions on military drills following Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's recent transit through Hawaii and Guam, emphasising the PLA's unwavering resolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu reaffirmed the PLA's mission to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and defend the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any attempt to split the nation through soliciting external support or resorting to force will be punished, and will never succeed," Wu said. (Xinhua)

 A memorial ceremony was held in Nanjing on Friday in honour of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mourners gathered at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders to remember those killed by invading Japanese forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers placed numerous large floral wreaths on stage, before the national anthem was played and a moment of silence held to a lowered national flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed during the six-week massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as National Memorial Day, to ensure the massacre is not forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, there are only 32 living registered survivors of the massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1945, the war against Japan came to an end as Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender in the Second World War. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has invited President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to kick off trading for the day, that he had been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration” without referring to any specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came soon after his incoming White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed during a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends” that Trump had invited Xi and other world leaders to attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  No head of state has previously made an official visit to the US for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented invitations come at a moment when much of the world is bracing for what comes next when Trump and his “America First” world view return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has vowed to levy massive tariffs against the United States' chief economic competitor, China, as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico - citing illegal immigration and illegal drugs as a factor in his decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danny Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said President Xi would not allow himself to “be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded, “I have nothing to share at present.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s January 20 inauguration is set to take place a day after the US deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. (AP)

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers over the next six weeks in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economic officials in outgoing US President Joe Biden's administration are set to meet their Chinese counterparts this week for talks, in a final effort to strengthen ties before Donald Trump's White House return.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks come as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed in an interview on Wednesday the need for "ongoing communications at all levels" to avoid needless worsening in relations between the world's two biggest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economic and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have continued to flare during Biden's time in office. But temperatures could rise further under Trump, who has threatened sweeping tariff increases on Chinese goods ahead of his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's critical to have open channels of communication," Yellen told Bloomberg Television, warning that Trump's universal tariffs proposal would likely trigger retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh is due to meet Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min for an economic working group meeting on the sidelines of Group of 20 talks in South Africa, said the US Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States and China are the two largest economies on the globe, and the American people expect that we should be able to communicate directly with Chinese officials on both areas where we agree and especially on areas where we don't," said Shambaugh.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury officials and representatives from other agencies will travel to the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing as well, for a financial working group meeting taking place on Sunday and Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's delegation is expected to be headed by People's Bank of China deputy governor Xuan Changneng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect US clean energy businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The notice from the US Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50 percent and duties on certain tungsten products will increase to 25 percent, effective on January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains,” US Trade Representative Katharine Tai said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the US of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the US. (AFP/AP)

 At least one person was killed after a powerful blast rocked a residential high-rise building in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, mainland media reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Fire Brigade said it sent 16 fire trucks and 80 rescue personnel to the scene after receiving a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing News said a preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out on the 28th floor due to a gas explosion, with the cause of the blast still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  One person reportedly fell off the building following the blast, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said workers at the nearby 66-storey China Resources Tower said they felt tremors after the explosion. Some companies in the building evacuated their staff to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations and rescue efforts are underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Huangmaohai Sea-Crossing Passage, connecting Zhuhai and Jiangmen, officially opened on Wednesday, and it is expected the link will boost travel across the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  The 31-kilometre link is the western extension of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and starts in Pingsha Town while ending in Taishan City's Doushan Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project consists of two main bridges - Huangmaohai Bridge and Gaolan Port Bridge, two tunnels, four interchanges and one service area.
  <br>
  <br>
  With its commencement, the travel time between Zhuhai and Jiangmen is reduced from more than one hour to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that some drivers from different GBA cities, including Zhuhai, Jiangmen and Macau, waited to get a glimpse of the link.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction of the bridge began in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the world's longest three-tower cable-stayed highway design bridge.

    Tap into the mainland database for clinical trials: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's healthcare sector needs to maximise its edge on the international stage by collaborating with its mainland counterparts in clinical trials, according to the chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spelling out his vision on RTHK programme Overview Policy, John Lee reiterated the main objective of reforming the healthcare system is to ensure efficient division of work among the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health and the Primary Healthcare Commission, which was set up in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make primary healthcare accessible for everyone in the community. People need to take good care of themselves, especially before they fall ill so they don't have to rely on treatment. The basis is to have everyone protect their own health on a day-to-day basis," Lee explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal, the chief executive stated, is to establish Hong Kong's own drug regulator and speed up registration of new pharmaceutical products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, a drug can only be submitted for approval after it has been registered in at least two reference jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the aim is to substitute part of that requirement with approved clinical trials, where collaboration with the mainland is essential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have data from 7.5 million patients. But if we can utilise the data from 1.4 billion people on the mainland, or even just 78 to 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, then the clinical trials will become a lot more effective," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader also stressed that careful planning is needed when establishing a third medical school in the city, to make sure it does not take away students or resources with the two existing institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only around 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the ratio of 2.5 in other advanced economies. There's a lot of catching up to do, and with the current limited intake quota for medical students it's very important to set up a third medical school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time I don't want these institutions to compete against each other for students. So right now the idea is to let two medical schools focus on teaching, while the third can focus on research and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee confirmed multiple universities have expressed interest to take up the initiative, and a working group is now assessing which one is the most suitable candidate and meets all of the Medical Council's requirements.

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who are deemed to have "behaved poorly" on Hong Kong-related issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington had grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously violated principles of international law and basic norms of international relations by imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who have behaved poorly on Hong Kong-related issues. We must emphasise that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. We urge the US side to genuinely respect China's sovereignty, Hong Kong's rule of law, and cease any form of interference in Hong Kong affairs," Mao said at a news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington had last month said it would impose fresh sanctions on Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the SAR's national security law following the jailing of 45 people for subversion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this year, including 506,804 units sold in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90 percent of its total sales, stood at 17.1 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In comparison, Volkswagen's two joint ventures with SAIC and FAW Group took a combined 11 percent market share in the January-November period, compared with 14.2 percent last year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.
  <br>

  The world's second-largest economy is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs from a second Donald Trump White House while dealing with other headwinds, suggesting more policy stimulus could be needed to shore up growth. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.

  Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

  "The Chinese government has actively assisted Chinese citizens who are willing to leave Syria in a safe and orderly way, and has maintained contact with... Chinese citizens who remain in Syria," the ministry said.

  "We urge the relevant Syrian parties to take practical measures to ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel in Syria," it added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China.
 <br>

  "He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s leaders," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 US military firms in response to the sale of American weapons to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move followed Beijing's strong objection to Washington authorising a potential US$385 million sale of spare parts and support for radars and F-16 fighter jets to the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said the move undermines its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also cover six top executives at some of the companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned companies would have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives would be barred from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday also urged Washington to "stop sending the wrong signals" after US House Speaker Mike Johnson had a phone call with Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to emphasise once again that the Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first red line that may not be crossed in Sino-U.S. relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has condemned Washington for allowing Lai to stop over in both Hawaii and Guam during a visit to the Pacific. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spring Festival has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by the UN's culture agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) made the decision on Wednesday, noting that the festival promotes family values, societal cohesion and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spring Festival, a tradition dating back thousands of years, marks the start of the new year in the Chinese calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unesco said the festival incorporates social customs to welcome the new year, seek blessings for good fortune, celebrate family reunions and promote community harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Minister of Culture and Tourism Rao Quan expressed gratitude for Unesco's recognition, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rao stressed that the Spring Festival stands as China's most important traditional festival, embodying Chinese people's aspirations for a better life and strong ties with family and the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this addition, China now has a total of 44 items on Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, the highest number in the world.

 Workers and residents near a construction site in Shenzhen had to evacuate their homes and workplaces following a sudden ground collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen people remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at 11pm on Wednesday at a construction site in the city's Bao'an District, prompting local authorities to cordon off streets hundreds of metres away from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby residents and workers were seen evacuating their homes and factories, with some saying they were asked to do so at about noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, who was leaving with her pet, said she was not sure when could she return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They asked us not to stay here and asked us to evacuate. They think it's not safe here and asked us to move elsewhere," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A worker said there was no arrangement of accommodation from his employer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has to evacuate... I don't know how to describe my feelings now. I can't work and also I have to pay and live elsewhere," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another worker said he was working at a nearby site when the collapse happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was working and the electricity supply was suddenly cut off... We're moving out due to safety concerns, and we have to wait for further announcement from the company," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An all-out rescue has been launched and an investigation into the accident is underway, state media reported.

    China urges the Philippines to stop its provocations

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Wednesday warned Manila to stop its infringements, provocations and actions, saying that a Philippine vessel intentionally rammed into a CCG ship around the Huangyan Dao, also known as the Scarborough Shoal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, the Philippines will be held accountable for all consequences arising from this," CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the CCG said the Philippines deployed coast guard vessels, official ships and fishing boats into waters around Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea as the Chinese fleet responded in accordance with the law and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG said that Philippine ships "came dangerously close", adding that a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings, made a sharp turn, reversed and deliberately rammed into a CCG ship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added the Philippine side was the party at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines said the CCG had fired water cannon and "sideswiped" a government vessel during a maritime patrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manila also released a video appearing to show a Chinese coast guard ship firing a jet of water at the Philippines fisheries department vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG accused Manila of making "bogus accusations in an attempt to mislead international understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  China said Huangyan Dao has always been its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated last month when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships, prompting China to summon the Philippine ambassador.
  <br>
  <br>
  And ties frayed further when the Philippines and the United States signed a security deal allowing both sides to share classified information. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it would restrict exports to the United States of some key components in making semiconductors, after Washington announced curbs targeting China's ability to make advanced chips.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the materials banned from export are metals gallium, antimony and germanium, the Commerce Ministry said in a statement that cited national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports of graphite, another key component, will also be subject to "stricter reviews of end-users and end-uses", the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To safeguard national security interests and fulfil international obligations such as non-proliferation, China has decided to strengthen export controls on relevant dual-use items to the United States," Beijing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any organisation or individual in any country or region violating the relevant regulations will be held accountable according to the law," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its own latest curbs, Washington on Monday announced restrictions on sales to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier, without additional permission.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the US Commerce Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move expands Washington's efforts to curb exports of state-of-the-art chips to China, which can be used in advanced weapons systems and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US rules also include controls on two dozen types of chip-making equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing swiftly vowed to defend its interests, saying the United States "abuses export control measures" and has "hindered normal economic and trade exchanges".
  <br>
  <br>
  And on Tuesday, China said Washington had "politicised and weaponised economic, trade and technological issues" as it unveiled its own export curbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The moves also restrict the exports of "dual-use items to United States military users or for military purposes", Beijing said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China lifted trade restrictions on two Australian meat processing facilities, allowing the full resumption of red meat exports to the country, the Australian government said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has now removed restrictions from all 10 Australian abattoirs it banned between 2020 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bans were imposed around the time that China blocked imports of commodities including coal, barley and wine from Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all those restrictions have been removed since a new government won power in Canberra in 2022, with trade in lobster, the final banned product, set to restart by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is great news for Australian exporters, producers and farmers," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since we were elected we've worked tirelessly to resume trade and that's exactly what we are seeing. It's a win for trade and a win for Australian jobs."
  <br>
  <br>
  China is the second largest market for Australian beef and veal after the United States, receiving around 200,000 metric tonnes a year worth around US$1.5 billion in recent years, Australian trade data showed. (Reuters)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said anti-subsidy tariffs imposed by the European Union on Chinese electric vehicles violated the principles of fair competition and free trade during talks with his German counterpart Annalena Baerbock in Beijing on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China urged Germany and Europe to view its development objectively and rationally, adopt an active and pragmatic policy towards China, and properly handle trade disputes through dialogue and consultation, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baerbock, for her part, said Germany supports the continuation of negotiations between China and the EU to try to find a mutually acceptable solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  On China-Germany ties, Wang said Beijing has always regarded Berlin as an important partner, and that differences between the two countries should not become obstacles to cooperation or lead to confrontation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister added that their relationship does not target any third party, and should not be subject to influence by any third party. (Reporting by Xinhua)

 The Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday said it hopes Hong Kong youngsters can have a greater understanding of the nation's foreign affairs through an annual knowledge contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 17th edition of the Hong Kong Cup Diplomatic Knowledge Contest is "Love Diplomacy, Love the World".
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest is jointly organised by the commissioner's office, the Education Bureau and the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng said the contest is an important platform for students to learn more about China's foreign policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and the 70th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. These two events are of great significance in the history of diplomacy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The contest aims to encourage Hong Kong youth to further understand major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and think of how to make greater and more contributions to the country's foreign affairs."
  <br>
  <br>
  A study tour to Beijing and Gansu Province was held in July for the winning teams of the 16th edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Director of Broadcasting Eddie Cheung said RTHK produced three episodes of the tour, to be aired on three Thursdays starting this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe students who joined the tour were able to combine the knowledge in their textbooks with their insight from the study tour, integrating their love for the country and Hong Kong, and tell good stories of our country," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Form three student from St. Paul's College said he will be participating in the upcoming contest and hopes he can do better this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I read more about the news in the world and I also read books about the diplomatic policies of China," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, I didn't go to the final competition, so this year, I wish I can get a better result in the online quiz and can get the chance to attend the final competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Applications will open on December 9. The first round of the contest will be held in March next year, and the final will take place in May.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's chief executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has pledged to work with Hong Kong in leveraging the advantages of the two SARs to foster development.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On whether we and Hong Kong could complement each other's strengths and foster mutual development, I think there's huge potential in this," Sam said in a press conference on Sunday flanked by his incoming cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he will meet with Chief Executive John Lee after he assumes office on December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After I take office, I'll talk to Chief Executive John Lee about how the two SARs can – on each side of the Pearl River and under our common constitutional and political system – fully leverage our respective advantages to foster development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll also look at how we can leverage our strengths and seek opportunities, while integrating into the nation's development, as we strive for achievements for both SARs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam and his governing team met the media a day after Beijing approved his nominations and appointed principal officials for the new term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The formation of this government's principal officials and prosecutor-general embodies the spirit of 'upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground', which completely aligns with the requirements I set out for principal officials," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incoming Macau leader added his government will respond to issues the public is most concerned about, and work on key tasks relating to the city's long-term development.

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

 The Foreign Ministry said three Chinese nationals jailed in the United States have returned to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's after the White House said three Americans jailed in China were released and heading back to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Following unremitting efforts by the Chinese government, three Chinese nationals wrongfully imprisoned by the American side have now safely returned to the motherland," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing in Beijing on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said Beijing "consistently opposes the American side carrying out the suppression and persecution of Chinese nationals out of political aims, and will continue as ever to take necessary measures" to uphold their interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao added a longtime "fugitive" was also extradited back to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Washington said it secured the return of three Americans classified by the US State Department as wrongfully detained.
  <br>

 The White House said three Americans jailed in China have been released and were heading back to the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  The trio – Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung – had been considered by Washington to be wrongfully detained by Beijing. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges while Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had spoken to all three. "I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they'll soon be reunited with their loved ones," he said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Politico, which first reported the release, said a number of Chinese citizens detained in the US would also be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's embassy in Washington did not comment on the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US has upgraded its travel advisory for China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department changed its travel warning to China to level 2, advising US citizens to “exercise increased caution” when travelling to the country. It had previously been at level 3, telling Americans to “reconsider travel”. (Agencies)

    Mainland papers dismiss Trump's tariff threat

<img alt="State media dismiss Trump's reasons for further tariffs as " src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780992_1_20241127095502.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 State media shrugged off US President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing him of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who takes office on January 20, said on Monday that he would impose "an additional 10 percent tariff, above any additional tariffs" on imports from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation, after Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is far-fetched," China Daily said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the US lies with the US itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in tariff wars. If the US continues to politicise economic and trade issues by weaponising tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday also pledged 25 percent tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had a "good" conversation with Trump immediately following the president-elect's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We talked about how the intense and effective connections between our two countries flow back and forth," as well as "some of the challenges that we can work on together," Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian leader has assembled a team of ministers to lobby US lawmakers and members of Trump's inner circle, a repeat of a charm offensive during his first term as president.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested on Tuesday that Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sheinbaum said she was willing to engage in talks on the issues but said drugs were a US problem. (Agencies)

    China 'open to dialogue' after Trump tariff threat

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it remains "open to dialogue" with the United States after president-elect Donald Trump vowed to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As a principle, we are open to maintaining dialogue and communication," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing, after being asked whether Beijing had reached out to Trump's team for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US said "no one will win a trade war" after Trump said he intends to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico in response to illegal drug trade and immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China believes that China-US economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature," Liu Pengyu, an embassy spokesman said in an email to AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a series of posts to his Truth Social account on Monday, Trump vowed to hit some of Washington's largest trading partners with duties on all goods entering the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 percent tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another post, Trump said he would be slapping China with a 10 percent tariff, "above any additional Tariffs," on all of its products entering the US in response to what he said was its failure to tackle fentanyl smuggling.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Canberra, China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, said on Tuesday that the US policy on trade with China and other countries would have an impact on relations between China and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "US policy on trade with China, with other countries as well, will have an impact and that is an important element that we have to consider," Xiao told a press conference in Canberra, in response to a question on whether potential tariffs by Trump would impact China and Australia's bilateral relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada described its trade relationship with the US "mutually beneficial".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course continue to discuss these issues with the incoming administration," said a statement from Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland.

  Many economists have warned that tariffs would hurt growth and push up inflation, since they are primarily paid by importers bringing the goods into the US, who often pass those costs on to consumers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But those in Trump's inner circle have insisted that the tariffs are a useful bargaining chip for the US to use to push its trading partners to agree to more favourable terms, and to bring back manufacturing jobs from overseas. (Agencies)

 The director of the central government's liaison office on Monday urged Hong Kong and Guangdong to work together to bring positive developments for the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong Deepening Economic, Trade and Investment Cooperation Conference in Guangzhou, Zheng Yanxiong said Hong Kong's economy and society have seen improvements with the help of the central government.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hopes the SAR and Guangdong could lead the GBA on the development of innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope Guangdong and Hong Kong can make good use of the advantages of the innovation and industrial chains of the GBA, focusing on emerging fields like artificial intelligence, life sciences, low-altitude economy and green development," Zheng said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two places should accelerate the cultivation and creation of new industries, and develop new quality productive forces."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming said the GBA has unlimited prospects, with the size of the economy reaching over 10 trillion yuan last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can improve together with Guangdong, making use of different advantages, with Hong Kong serving as a super-connector and a super value-adder, and helping Guangdong and Hong Kong go global together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who is leading a delegation of government officials and business leaders on a visit to the GBA, also attended the conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong and Guangdong reached agreement on 126 economic and trade cooperation projects totalling more than 100 billion yuan at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of these projects, 101 involve Hong Kong businesses investing in Guangdong, with a total value exceeding 91 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They cover areas like financial cooperation, modern logistics, smart productions, biomedicine and artificial intelligence, demonstrating the love for the country and family as well as practical actions by Hong Kong entrepreneurs in actively serving the development of Guangdong and the mainland," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The delegation arrived in Foshan on Monday night on the next leg of their visit. Lee will return to Hong Kong on Tuesday, with Chief Secretary Eric Chan continuing to lead the delegation that will also visit Dongguan, Huizhou and Shenzhen.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union on Monday formally launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China's move to impose anti-dumping measures on brandy imported from the bloc.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports are legitimate trade remedies fully in line with WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said in a statement: "By requesting consultations with China over its provisional anti-dumping measures on EU brandy, the Commission is following through on its commitment to protect our industry from unfounded accusations and misuse of trade defence measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to a media query on the consultation request filed by the EU over these measures through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, a Commerce Ministry official said the Chinese side will handle it in accordance with the WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move by Beijing to impose anti-dumping measures last month came after the EU slapped additional import tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. China has filed its own complaint with the WTO over the new tariffs on electric vehicles. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China said it hopes Japan will work towards improving people exchanges between the two countries, after Beijing announced a visa-free arrangement for Japanese citizens last week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We certainly hope that the Japanese side will join us... to enhance the level of facilitation of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a regular briefing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has always attached great importance to the facilitation of people-to-people exchanges."
  <br>
  <br>
  China will expand its visa-free arrangements to include Japan and eight other countries, including Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, from November 30, 2024, to December 31, 2025, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's part of ongoing efforts to boost international tourism and business travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will also extend the visa-free stay period to 30 days from 15 days for citizens of all 38 countries within its visa-free programme. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in helping companies in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) go global.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Listed Companies Summit, Chan described the GBA as a developed economy, and said companies in the area are vital for the country's opening-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR, as an international financial centre, can help create more opportunities and add value for GBA companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the geopolitical haze, mainland companies are facing unprecedented challenges when they raise funds in the Western markets. Hong Kong will reform the financial market in response to the situation to gather more domestic and overseas funds to support projects and companies in the GBA," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as they are beneficial to companies, the development of Hong Kong's financial market, and the development of the country, we will actively study and push forward the policies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi Bin, deputy director of Beijing's liaison office, said there are 5,000 listed companies in the GBA, and they help promote cooperation in areas like finance, economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope listed companies in the GBA could actively make use of Hong Kong's advantages, and treat the city as a base for overseas expansion. While consolidating the American and Western markets, we should work together and expand into emerging markets like the Asean, Middle East and Latin America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Starry Lee, meanwhile thanked the country for supporting the city's development as an international financial centre, international aviation hub and offshore renminbi hub.

    Govt-market integration key for Hetao: Sun Dong

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry on Sunday said government backing and an efficient market are both necessary, if plans to expand a Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech zone were to succeed.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Dong's comments came days after officials unveiled the development outline for the SAR section of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Cooperation Zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first phase of the development now covers twice the gross floor area compared to the original scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said he explained to his friends in Shanghai what Hetao is really about.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them today's Northern Metropolis is like Shanghai's Pudong district in the old days, and that Hetao is equivalent to Pudong's Oriental Pearl," he recalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They immediately understood that this is extremely important for Hong Kong's future development."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister added mainland officials faced similar challenges when they developed Pudong in the 1990s. But they made it happen, even with a limited budget, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US president-elect Donald Trump's tech restrictions on China and how it might affect Hong Kong, Sun said the city should work more closely with the mainland and strengthen its own technology infrastructure to cope with the complex global environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The innovation chief also called on local tech companies to procure supplies and equipment from different sources, instead of relying too much on a single market.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said China is ready to engage in dialogue and manage differences with the United States to promote steady and sustained development of bilateral economic ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's also the China International Trade Representative, told a press conference on Friday that the world's two-largest economies are highly complementary as he emphasised the importance of their relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to a reporter's question about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose 60 percent tariffs on imports from China, he said that would "not solve the country’s own trade deficit problem”.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it leads to higher prices for imported products and inflation, with the burden ultimately falling on consumers," Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that China's total foreign trade including imports and exports reached 36 trillion yuan in January-October, up about 5 percent from the same period of 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  During Friday's press conference, Wang and other officials outlined ways that China is promoting expanding trade and support for coping with climate change.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such measures include streamlining customs and visa requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  China allows visa-free travel for citizens of 29 countries, including France and Germany, and the number of foreign visitors, which plunged during the pandemic, has jumped this year. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The country's biggest internet forum concluded its four-day session in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, on Friday, with more than 1,800 guests from over 130 countries taking part.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech representatives and government ministers meet annually in the town for the World Internet Conference, which focused this year on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the conference, the World Internet Development report 2024 was issued, reviewing China’s internet development over the past three decades and projecting future directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the evolution of global cyberspace governance and stressed the need for international consensus on AI and data issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some attendees about what they hoped the summit will achieve.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the participants, City University’s deputy president Ray Cheung, said he wants more teaching collaboration within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “City University already established our Dongguan campus and 80 percent of the faculty that are teaching courses in Dongguan is actually coming from Hong Kong. So what we are seeing is a lot of synergies actually developing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So we see Hong Kong as the global international education hub is taking a very important role for the GBA as well as the global education development.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another attendee, Stanford neuroscientist and researcher Walter Greenleaf, said he hope to see some agreements to address looming healthcare crises after the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've learned from the pandemic that what happens in one spot can impact another spot. So I think as healthcare providers, as developers of healthcare technology, we need to transcend borders and just make sure that we realise that as people, as part of the world, we are in a great position to help each other."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Lillian Cheong on Thursday said Hong Kong has a big role to play in the innovation development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing a panel at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Cheong said the SAR can act as a hub for global innovative resources and a data port.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For us to seek new developments, we should rely on the interaction and usage of data. Hong Kong has unique advantages. It can be the hub for global innovative resources,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It can connect both mainland data and overseas data. It can be a data port. Hong Kong can also allow the orderly flow of data and facilitate the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that the administration has signed a cross-border data flow MOU with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun Weimin, chief engineer of the CAC, told the same forum that the digital economy has become a crucial force reshaping the world’s innovation landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun called for innovation-led and secure development to create a bright future for the GBA’s internet industry.

  “The Greater Bay Area has a highly developed economy and a high degree of digitalisation, facing more urgent security threats. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in aspects such as information sharing and incident handling,” she said.

    President Xi Jinping begins state visit to Brazil

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for "more voices" to end the Ukraine war and a ceasefire in Gaza, as he conducted a state visit to Brazil's capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency said Xi wanted to see "more voices committed to peace to pave the way for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis" and "a ceasefire and an end to the war at an early date" in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the appeal during a state visit to Brasilia, where he was hosted by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Brasilia have advanced a joint roadmap for peace in Ukraine that has been endorsed by Moscow but rejected by Kyiv.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world plagued by armed conflicts and political strife, China and Brazil put peace, diplomacy and dialogue first," Lula said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's appeal for a halt to fighting in Gaza - where Israel is pressing an offensive against Hamas - echoed one he and the other G20 leaders made during a summit held Monday and Tuesday in Rio.
  <br>
  <br>
  That summit's joint statement called for a "comprehensive" ceasefire in both Gaza and Lebanon, where Israel is also waging an offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's state visit to Brasilia showcased closer relations between the biggest economies in Asia and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two leaders signed 35 cooperation accords on areas including agriculture, trade, technology and environmental protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-Brazil relations "are at their best in history" and the two countries are now "reliable friends," according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula said he looked forward to welcoming Xi to Brazil again next July for a Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit to Brazil's capital comes fresh off his attendance at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, and an Apec summit last week in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese leader figured prominently at both summits, in contrast with outgoing US President Joe Biden, who cut a spectral figure as fellow leaders looked past him, politically, to the coming presidency of Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  That difference also spoke to China's ascendant role as a trade partner and investor in Latin America, and expectations that America under Trump will erect trade and migration barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lula welcomed Xi with full honours, greeting him on the red carpet as horse-mounted guards rode past, a military brass band played their national anthems, and lines of children waved Chinese and Brazilian flags. (Agencies)

    US martial arts master harnesses AI to teach kung fu

<div class="itemFullText">
 From a small town in America to China's Wudang Mountains, Tai Chi master Jake Pinnick says he finds artificial intelligence increasingly useful for teaching kung fu and translating traditional Chinese texts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The martial arts practitioner from Illinois, who has lived in China since 2010, is the 16th-generation disciple of the Wudang San Feng lineage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK during the ongoing World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Pinnick said he wanted to share his experience of using the internet to connect with students worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have classes with people in different countries, different time zones, and so really I just came here to share my experience with that hoping that there's more opportunity for connection," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit is themed around the use of AI and building a digital future for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kung fu coach said technological breakthroughs were a great help when it came to teaching martial arts on the mountains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, training martial arts, there's only so much that it can really help with as far as the martial arts side, like maybe with organising videos or adding subtitles," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pinnick added that AI-powered tools can identify language, such as traditional Chinese text which can be difficult to translate, helping him to organise ideas faster and broadcast them to more people.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the tech rivalry between China and the US, Pinnick said he believed it was a healthy competition that would lead to better communication tools and more connections between countries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

    AI plays big role in peacekeeping: Unesco

<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    Macau's made good progress over the years: Ho Iat-seng

<img alt="Macau's outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng says people should not see the two SARs as rivals. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779957_1_20241119213646.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau’s outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, on Tuesday said he’s basically accomplished all of the promises set out in his election manifesto five years ago, adding that the gaming hub has made great strides in many areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters for the first time since his announcement not to seek re-election, Ho said his administration had to overcome many challenges during his five-year tenure – including the Covid pandemic that lasted three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, he said Macau's economy expanded and measures were also put in place to better safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the stress and a prolonged lack of rest over the years had taken a toll on his health, and he believes it's now time to pass the baton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also confirmed that the Macau government will continue to dish out MOP 10,000 to permanent residents and MOP 6,000 to non-permanent residents next year, saying his successor, Sam Hou-fai, agrees with the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the outgoing Macau CE noted that he hopes Macau and Hong Kong can continue to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Macau has always been learning from Hong Kong, saying the city has made substantial progress in areas like finance, maritime and aviation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Hong Kong's development as a mega events hub, Ho said people should not see the two SARs as rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Hong Kong and Macau has the vibe for mega events. We are developing this together... We invite different international singers to perform, and both places have the vibe to host concerts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next term of the Macau government should also work closely with Hong Kong because the relationship between the two places is very good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho's successor, former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai, is due to take office on December 20.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says foreign criticism of court sentences handed down on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far tramples on the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said no one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape legal punishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also said Beijing firmly supports Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consulate in Hong Kong said Washington strongly condemns the sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia said it was gravely concerned about the fate of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng, who was jailed for seven years and three months.

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.
    <br>

     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)
