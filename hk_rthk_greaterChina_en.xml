<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Internet Conference officially got underway in Wuzhen of Zhejiang province on Wednesday, with President Xi Jinping calling for faster innovative and secure development of cyberspace to create a better digital future.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit — the country's biggest internet forum — focuses on artificial intelligence and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking via a video link, Xi said the new technology had brought both opportunities and unpredictable challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  “New technologies, like AI, are flourishing. This has greatly enhanced humanity's capacity to understand and shape the world we live in, and at the same time presented us with a series of unpredictable risks and challenges,” the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China would work with other countries in information revolution and development to harness the internet’s potential for greater global benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China stands ready to work with all countries to seize the historical initiative in information revolution and development, and build a community with a shared future in cyberspace, so that together we can enable the internet to deliver greater benefits to the people and to the world.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said the country's cutting-edge technologies had delivered fruitful outcomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So far, China has put in place the world's largest network infrastructure with advanced technology and the internet has been available to 78 percent of the population.” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding proposed four points for building a shared future in cyberspace, including improving global governance, strengthening tech collaboration, promoting fairness and universal benefits in internet use, and upholding laws and regulations for cybersecurity protection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his speech, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member expressed hopes for active dialogue during the summit to build a shared future in cyberspace.

    AI plays big role in peacekeeping: Unesco

<div class="itemFullText">
 Artificial intelligence is playing a bigger role in peacekeeping with real-time AI translation making it easier for nations to communicate, says Unesco’s chair in AI and data science for society.
 <br>
  <br>
  Professor Lampros Stergioulas, who is attending the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, says he hopes this year’s summit can address both the benefits and risks of using AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect to see some agreements about cross-border data exchanges and at least some agreements in principle on data exchange standards that can be used for AI training,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[Also] agreement on exchange of information because it's important to have open exchange of these developments, otherwise we will go into very dangerous territory as a planet.”
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's Wuzhen summit - the country's biggest annual internet forum - focuses on AI and its impact on humanity.
  <br>
  <br>
  On its impact on diplomacy, Stergioulas said AI translation applications can ensure, “diplomatic affairs and dialogue between nations happen in a more immediate and constructive manner.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hague University of Applied Sciences scholar added that AI-powered tools, such as drones and robots, could help support humanitarian missions in conflict and disaster zones.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Drones can be also used to deliver aid and relief and resources to people that need it very quickly. The same with robots in the ground or dangerous zones, for example. We need to build a lot more infrastructure on that and not just focus on the military use," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stergioulas admitted that the new technology was a double-edged sword, stressing the need for AI ethics and regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example drones used in warfare... there's a lot of development of autonomous weapons and some concerns there really from almost every country and almost every army in the world, so there are some great challenges we need to be aware of,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2021, Unesco pioneered a globally-accepted AI ethics framework which aims to keep AI safe and secure and under human control.

    Macau's made good progress over the years: Ho Iat-seng

<img alt="Macau's outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng says people should not see the two SARs as rivals. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779957_1_20241119213646.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau’s outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, on Tuesday said he’s basically accomplished all of the promises set out in his election manifesto five years ago, adding that the gaming hub has made great strides in many areas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters for the first time since his announcement not to seek re-election, Ho said his administration had to overcome many challenges during his five-year tenure – including the Covid pandemic that lasted three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, he said Macau's economy expanded and measures were also put in place to better safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the stress and a prolonged lack of rest over the years had taken a toll on his health, and he believes it's now time to pass the baton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also confirmed that the Macau government will continue to dish out MOP 10,000 to permanent residents and MOP 6,000 to non-permanent residents next year, saying his successor, Sam Hou-fai, agrees with the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the outgoing Macau CE noted that he hopes Macau and Hong Kong can continue to work closely together.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Macau has always been learning from Hong Kong, saying the city has made substantial progress in areas like finance, maritime and aviation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Hong Kong's development as a mega events hub, Ho said people should not see the two SARs as rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Hong Kong and Macau has the vibe for mega events. We are developing this together... We invite different international singers to perform, and both places have the vibe to host concerts," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next term of the Macau government should also work closely with Hong Kong because the relationship between the two places is very good."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho's successor, former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai, is due to take office on December 20.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says foreign criticism of court sentences handed down on Tuesday in Hong Kong's largest national security trial thus far tramples on the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said no one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape legal punishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin also said Beijing firmly supports Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consulate in Hong Kong said Washington strongly condemns the sentencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia said it was gravely concerned about the fate of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng, who was jailed for seven years and three months.

 The 2024 World Internet Conference, also known as the Wuzhen summit, takes place from November 19 to 22 in Zhejiang province in eastern China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Scholars, tech companies and government officials from around the world gather annually in one of the nation's famous historic water towns - Wuzhen - known for its rivers and canals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2014, China's biggest internet forum brings together global stakeholders to discuss issues, such as tech trends, internet governance and the responsible use of technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a congratulatory note sent to the first Wuzhen Summit, President Xi Jinping said he hoped internet specialists could "improve cooperation and build a safe network", and "reach agreements on global network governance".

    <br>
    This year's edition will feature 24 sub-forums on topics such as cybersecurity, digital economy, data governance and the Global Development Initiative.
    <br>
    <br>
    The summit will see the establishment of a special committee on AI, a think tank cooperation programme, and an international digital training institute.
    <br>
    <br>
    There will also be a new award to celebrate outstanding achievements in the field of the global internet.

     What role does Hong Kong play in the Wuzhen talks?

    <br>

    A number of local tech sector representatives are attending the Wuzhen summit, including IT sector lawmaker Duncan Chiu, who will give a speech about Hong Kong's AI development.

     <br>
     Chiu told RTHK that the SAR could contribute in many ways with ongoing AI projects in universities and startups.
     <br>
     <br>
     "There are many projects ongoing and in universities, we see there are many teams
     <br>
     working on different application of AI, especially in some vertical sectors, like financial markets and on medical," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "The use of AI for enhancing the research result is also on display in many startup teams in Hong Kong."
     <br>
     <br>
     He added that the city's unique position allows it to bridge global and mainland data guidelines, potentially becoming a leader in cross-border data convergence.
     <br>
     <br>
     "We can do some trials [to test] how to deal with these data safely and usefully and comply to global standards, regulations, laws, and also fit with the mainland law. That will become a very important breakthrough in terms of doing these cross-border data examples," Chiu said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged G20 leaders on Monday to support efforts to de-escalate the war in Ukraine and reach a "political solution," state media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The G20 should support the United Nations and its Security Council in playing a greater role, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for leaders to avoid "spillovers" from battlefields and escalation of fighting, and to help "cool the Ukraine crisis and seek a political solution."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's remarks at the G20 summit in Brazil come shortly after Ukraine reportedly received a US green light to launch long-range missiles provided by Washington against targets inside Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Russia's Foreign Ministry said any use of these missiles by Ukraine to attack Russian territory would mark a radical escalation of the conflict, fundamentally alter the nature of the war and trigger "an adequate and tangible" response from Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Xi also called for efforts to shore up multilateral trade systems and warned against politicising economic issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for more international governance and cooperation on AI, saying this should not become "a game of rich countries and the wealthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, the president touted China's support for the developing world and pledged more aid initiatives, including proposing an initiative with three other G20 members to help the Global South gain better access to scientific and technological innovations.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a session on the reform of global governance institutions, Xi warned against protectionism in the name of green and low-carbon development, referring to tariffs on Chinese products like electric vehicles and biodiesel imposed by G20 members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve global trade governance and build a world economy characterised by openness," Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. (Agencies)

 Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies began arriving on Monday at Rio de Janeiro's Modern Art Museum for their annual summit, bracing for a shift in the global order with the return to power of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among them is President Xi Jinping, who arrived in Rio on Sunday for the summit and a state visit to Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva received the heads of government on a red carpet at the museum where they will meet through Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their discussions of trade, climate change and international security will run up against the sharp US policy changes that Trump vows upon taking office in January, from tariffs to the promise of a negotiated solution to the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security has been strengthened with troops reinforcing police for the duration of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has also been meeting with G20 leaders on the sidelines of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said Beijing and London "should adopt a rational and objective perspective on each other's development," according to Xinhua News Agency, adding that the two countries should deepen political mutual trust to ensure the steady development of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want our relations to be consistent, durable, respectful as we have agreed, avoid surprises where possible, and strengthened dialogue should provide stronger understanding," Starmer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first meeting between the leaders of China and the UK since 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said "there is no fundamental conflict of interests between China and Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese said there had been "encouraging progress in the stabilisation of our relationship". (Reuters/Xinhua)

    'Improve grazing practices to save giant wild pandas'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An associate professor of environmental science on Monday said sustainable grazing practices backed by regulations and community involvement are vital for protecting giant wild panda habitats.
 <br>
  <br>
  Binbin Li from Duke Kunshan University led a research project from July 2018 to May 2024 in China, quantifying the damage caused by livestock grazing on bamboo ecosystems and other vital vegetation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is fragmentation. We have agriculture, cropland, linear infrastructure and also residency area, so that makes their habitat fragmented, and then a lot of the populations are so small, and we're worried about the local extinction of some of the small populations," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The key right now is how we can reconnect some of the habitat and also reduce degradation for example from livestock grazing or the other types of natural resource uses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that by assessing the impact of grazing on pandas, the study was able to identify suitable grazing areas and patterns, adding that these findings lay the groundwork for developing effective grazing management policies to safeguard panda habitats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a livestock ban in certain areas but we also provide composition from the government and to the local communities but not just composite them to sell their livestock but also provide some long-time subsidy for example give like job opportunities to hire them as rangers so then they can receive long-term incentives not to have livestock again," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is key for a lot of conservation actions. How you can provide a long-term mechanism to incentivise local communities and to do conservation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li was speaking to reporters after the kick-off ceremony for the 29th Ocean Park Conservation Day under the theme "Safeguarding Wild Giant Pandas and Their Habitats".
  <br>
  <br>
  In regards to the six pandas living in Hong Kong, she said pandas in captivity need to be given a lot of space and care, adding that she hopes the SAR's enthusiasm for the animals will drive conservation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to pay attention to the welfare of pandas in captivity and enough space, and then the air conditioning is good, especially during summer, because they love cool temperatures. I think captive pandas are very important as a window to understand what is going on with the wild pandas. So the key thing for captivity or zoos is to do education," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These six pandas, maybe they can attract more attention from the public and to conserve pandas in the wild because there are a lot more out there and they are facing more threats than the captive pandas."

    'China to build more Belt and Road transport networks'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Minister of Transport Fu Xuyin said on Monday that the nation will keep building transport networks with Belt and Road countries, while continuing its internal reform of logistics and transport to lower costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the comment while giving a speech at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said international supply chains are under duress amid global uncertainties, in part arising from geopolitics and trade protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong, Fu said, will continue to play a key role in stabilising global supply chains through its logistics, maritime and aviation developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to strengthen the shipping cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong, consolidating and enhancing the SAR's status as an international shipping centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will facilitate Hong Kong's deeper integration into the country's overall development, and better utilise its advantages of having the motherland's backing and its connectivity to the world, so as to contribute globally in trading and shipping."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same event, Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said the airport's third-runway system to be launched later this month will be a game-changer because it'll bring extra capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government envisages Hong Kong rising as a green and smart port, as it outlined in its plans to develop the SAR into a green maritime fuel bunkering centre.

 President Xi Jinping vowed on Saturday vowed to work with the incoming US administration of President-elect Donald Trump as he held his final talks with outgoing President Joe Biden.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden met Xi for about two hours at a hotel where the Chinese leader was staying, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru, for their first talks in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-US relationship remains unchanged," following the election, Xi said, acknowledging "ups and downs" between the countries. "China is ready to work with the new US administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden told Xi that the two leaders haven't always agreed but their discussions have been "frank" and "candid."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said the two countries' relationship would make "considerable progress" when both nations "treat each other as partner and friend, seek common ground while shelving differences and help each other succeed, according to a simultaneous translation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if we take each other as rivals or adversary, pursue vicious competition, and seek to hurt each other, we would roil the relationship or even set it back," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks come two months before Trump assumes office. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in their first meeting that China hoped Japan would "properly handle" major issues such as history and Taiwan, according to state media on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi called for the two Asian neighbours to safeguard the global free trade system, as well as stable and unimpeded production and supply chains, as they met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum summit in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed that China is ready to work with Japan "in accordance with the principles and directions set out in the four political documents" between the two countries, and adhere to the important consensus that they are "cooperative partners rather than threats to each other", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan are close neighbours and important countries in Asia and the world, Xi said, adding that bilateral relations bears significance beyond bilateral dimension.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba told Xi that Japan's position on the Taiwan question, based on the Japan-China joint communique in 1972, remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese prime minister also said he wanted to build a "constructive and stable" relationship, and that Tokyo has no intention of decoupling from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit for the first time in two years on the sidelines of Apec.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi told Yoon that "the international and regional situations have undergone many changes" over the past two years, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how the situation changes, China and South Korea should stick to the original intention in establishing diplomatic ties, firmly adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship, and remain committed to the goal of mutual benefit and win-win cooperation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon told his Chinese counterpart that their two countries should cooperate for peace in the face of North Korea and Russia's military cooperation, according to the South Korean President's office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon expressed his hope that "South Korea and China will cooperate in promoting stability and peace in the region in response to North Korea's successive provocations, the war in Ukraine, and Russia-North Korea military cooperation", his office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon also called for the two countries to further strengthen cooperation in the economic sector, which he called "the central axis of bilateral relations over the past 30 years", Yoon's office said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has warned that the world is entering an era of harmful "protectionism", in remarks to an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of what will be his final official face-to-face with outgoing US President Joe Biden, Xi raised concern about "spreading unilateralism and protectionism", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as cautioning against "fragmentation of the world economy" in a written speech prepared for a meeting of CEOs on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Biden are in the Peruvian capital for a two-day meeting of heads of state of the 21-member Apec grouping.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the sitting leaders of the world's two largest economies will have their final official encounter before Trump takes office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his prepared remarks reported by Xinhua, Xi said the world had "entered a new period of turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said attempts to use pretexts to block economic cooperation and to break up the interdependence of the world were nothing but back-pedalling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should see to it that economic globalisation generates more positive outcomes and is taken to a new phase that is more dynamic, inclusive and sustainable," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the principles of "plan together, build together and benefit together" should be followed, the representation and voice of the Global South should be enhanced continuously, and all countries should be ensured of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules in conducting international economic cooperation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday inaugurated Latin America's first Beijing-funded port in Chancay, Peru -- a symbol of China's growing influence on the continent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$3.5-billion complex, about 80 kilometres north of Lima, is meant to serve as a hub for Chinese trade as the country prepares for the threat of major tariff hikes once Donald Trump re-enters the White House for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The port was officially opened in a ceremony overseen virtually by Xi and Peruvian counterpart Dina Boluarte from Lima, where they will attend an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Friday and Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China plays a major role in the growth of our economy," Boluarte said at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, for his part, said the port would help "promote connectivity" between South America and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are witnessing... the birth of a new land-sea channel between Asia and Latin America in the new era," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru -- one of Latin America's fastest-growing economies over the past decade -- is China's fourth-largest Latin American trading partner, with bilateral flows of nearly US$36 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States as they trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chancay is the latest addition to infrastructure projects built under the Belt and Road Initiative to stimulate trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed Cosco Shipping Ports, which owns 60 percent of the port, has a 30-year concession to operate the terminal and has forecast it will handle up to a million containers in its first year of operation. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Lima, kicking off a week-long diplomatic visit of South America during which he will attend the Apec Leaders’ meeting and the G20 summit in Brazil.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peru pulled out all the stops at the airport, rolling out the red carpet while soldiers performed a guard of honour as Xi’s chartered jet landed just after noon, Lima time.
  <br>
  <br>
  First to greet the Chinese leader was Gustavo Adrianzen, the Peruvian Prime minister who stood in for President Dina Boluarte while she was occupied by other Apec engagements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived the previous night, also greeted Xi on the tarmac, alongside Beijing’s top diplomat in Peru, Song Yang.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shaking hands, Xi and Lee had a brief conversation as dozens of officials, bodyguards, and media representatives watched on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president then headed to Government Palace for a state reception by his counterpart Boluarte.
  <br>
  <br>
  On top of their agenda was the inauguration of the Chancay megaport, which is jointly funded and owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leaders were also expected to sign bilateral agreements covering trade and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will also meet US President Joe Biden during his time in Lima, before moving on to Rio de Janeiro next week for the G20 summit.

    China's Zeekr to take control of sister brand Lynk
   </title>

<img alt="The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779186_1_20241114204953.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Geely said on Thursday its premium electric vehicle maker Zeekr plans to take control of sister brand Lynk & Co - the first big restructuring move in a planned overhaul for the sprawling automotive group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid," Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Volvo Cars were up 3.5 percent in early trade, among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-listed shares of Zeekr dropped over 7 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeekr will then nudge its stake up to 51 percent with a capital injection while Geely Auto, the group's main listed arm, will continue to own the rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. It should be completed by June next year, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traditional values of family and loyalty are vital for not just many Chinese families, but also overseas Chinese businesses seeking to win the hearts of the people in Peru, the host of this year’s Apec summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation, which is welcoming global leaders to its capital Lima this week, does most of its trade with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is home to around 170 Chinese enterprises, many of which heeded the call by the central government to look for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Chinese presence in Peru dates back to the 19th century. Chinese food is extremely popular in the country, with thousands of Chifas, or restaurants which serve mostly Cantonese dishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The term Chifa is believed to have come from the Chinese words “eat rice”, meaning to have a meal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from the catering industry, Chinese immigrants also thrive in other sectors, especially manufacturing.
  <br>
  <br>
  That includes Alfredo Chang, who oversees the Calimod group, one of the most recognised footwear brands in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  Employing over 600 locals, Chang runs a vast business and knows the production chain inside and out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secret to success, he says, is to treat employees like family and gain their loyalty, both of which are traditional Chinese values.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our company culture is that if we treat the workers well, the workers will treat the company well too,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chang recalled the difficult times during Covid, when he refused to send workers on no-pay leave even after the government granted employers the right to do so.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had to take out bank loans to tide over the crisis. The bold move has won the hearts of workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As a result, many employees would turn down offers from other companies, and say, ‘I’m not leaving. This place is like family to me.’ Our company culture is that we are all a family.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His son, Thomas, has plans to expand the business to nearby regions such as Ecuador, Colombia and Chile.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also hopes the Chankay megaport, which is majority owned by Chinese shipping giant Cosco, can bring down the cost of raw materials imported from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the biggest opportunity for Peru is to really become a hub for South America. Right now with the Chankay port, the lead time from Shanghai to Peru is around 20 days. It's almost half of what is right now, and Chankay is going to be the biggest port on the [South American] Pacific,” he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The freight will be much cheaper, so that will help us probably be more competitive.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He added South American neighbours such as Brazil should utilise the port and fast-track their shipments to China.

    Xi to hold final talks with Biden in Peru: US official

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping will reportedly be holding talks with his US counterpart Joe Biden on Saturday on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Peru, in what’s expected to be their last official talks before Donald Trump takes office.
 <br>
  <br>
  A senior Biden administration official briefed reporters about the meeting on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect this will be their last meeting as presidents," the official said. "With that in mind, we expect the president will use the opportunity to take stock of efforts to responsibly manage competition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has already signaled a confrontational approach with Beijing for his second term, picking a number of outspoken China hawks for key foreign and defense positions in his top team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Republican has also promised to slap 60-percent tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to fears of a renewed trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration official would not be drawn on whether he would try to advise China on how to deal with Trump – or if he would advise Trump on how to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a difficult, complicated, consequential relationship," the official said. "The president has been pretty clear that he even admits the competitive aspects of the relationship, we need to find ways to manage it responsibly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden heads to Lima on Thursday for the APEC summit on Friday and Saturday for his swansong at the major gathering of Asia-Pacific economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been working for months to arrange a final meeting between Xi and Biden before the Democrat leaves office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saturday's talks will be the third meeting between Biden and Xi during Biden's presidency. They met in Woodside, California, last November on the sidelines of the 2023 Apec summit, and the leaders last spoke by phone in April. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping headed to Peru on Wednesday, bound for a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) organisation leaders overshadowed by fears of renewed global trade tensions under US President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will join leaders from the United States and other Asia-Pacific nations in the Peruvian capital Lima for the Apec gathering, after which he will go to Brazil for a G20 summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Peru, Xi will also inaugurate South America's first Chinese-funded port, in Chancay, around 80 kilometres north of Lima.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chancay port will also serve Chile, Colombia and Ecuador, among other South American countries, allowing them to skirt ports in Mexico and the United States for trade with Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting on Wednesday, Lima will receive government ministers and business leaders of Apec member countries, which also include Russia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Chile and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ministerial meetings will take place on Thursday, followed by talks at the level of heads of state the following two days. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping's special representative at the United Nations climate summit has called for a strengthening of early warning systems and enhancing climate adaptation capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang was addressing a high-level meeting held by China on Tuesday, during COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, said China attached great importance to international cooperation on meteorological early warnings and that President Xi had made specific requirements on this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting, Ding proposed three points, including standardising climate risk assessments, building a global early warning network by sharing technology and enhancing interconnectivity, and establishing a climate adaptation partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China would develop a South-South cooperation flagship project for early warning in response to climate change, and support developing countries with meteorological observation equipment, early warning systems, and training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere at the summit, scientists said global carbon dioxide emissions, including those from burning fossil fuels, would hit a record high this year, pulling the world further off course from averting more destructive climate extremes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Global Carbon Budget report, published during the climate summit, said global CO2 emissions are set to total 41.6 billion metric tons in 2024, up from 40.6 billion tons last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report forecast that emissions in China would marginally increase by 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report's authors said China's emissions from oil use have likely peaked, as electric vehicles gain market share. (Agencies)

 Peru is keen to deepen its strategic partnership with China when it hosts President Xi Jinping for the Apec summit in Lima this week, while the Peruvian Chinese community says they are highly regarded by the locals because of their law-abiding and hardworking nature.

  China is already Peru’s largest trading partner, accounting for 53 percent of all exports from the South American nation last year.

  Figures from the Trade Development Council in Hong Kong show that trade between the two nations exceeded US$20 billion in the first half of this year, nearly reaching the full-year total of 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ties between China and Peru can be traced back to the 19th century, when the first batch of Chinese workers arrived at the shores of the South American nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Loo moved from Hong Kong to Peru in 1979, when he was just 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is now the president of Sociedad Central de Beneficencia China – which roughly translates as the Chinese Benevolent Society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group was founded in 1886 by a Qing dynasty official, and is steeped in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo said the earliest Chinese immigrants worked as hard labour, after slavery was outlawed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they gradually raised their social status, and now the Chinese are highly regarded in Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have our ancestors to thank for this. They have always been model citizens. In the eyes of Peruvians, Chinese people are hardworking, honest and clever,” he told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That’s how locals see us, and that’s why Chinese Peruvians are able to achieve in different sectors such as business, and politics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Today it is estimated that about 10 percent of the Peruvian population has Chinese origins.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society, which has lent a helping hand to countless immigrants over the years, is moving with the times by switching its focus to promoting – and preserving – Chinese culture.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lion dance troupe with more than 200 teenagers. Half of them are Peruvians and the other half are Chinese. Their performances are very well received by the locals – you’ll see us in festivals, events and opening ceremonies. Apart from promoting Chinese culture, the troupe also galvanises the Chinese community here and foster exchanges with Peruvians,” Loo explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The society has been recognised by the Chinese embassy in Peru for its work.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been invited to take part in Beijing’s foreign aid programme, dishing out emergency funds to Chinese citizens who encounter unexpected situations or accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tour of the society’s headquarters in Chinatown, Loo showed RTHK group photos featuring Xi, when he last visited Peru in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to it was another photo with former president Hu Jintao, taken in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo can look forward to a third group photo, when he and other Chinese Peruvian representatives greet the president again, later this week.

<img alt="This year, larger ticket household appliances performed better than last year, including energy-efficient air conditioners, robot vacuum cleaners and smart toilets, per JD.com.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's largest e-commerce company Alibaba Group said it recorded "robust growth" in sales and a "record number" of shoppers over this year's Singles' Day sales period, a weeks-long event that ended at midnight on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm did not release total sales revenue for the period but said 45 brands - including Apple, Haier, Midea and Xiaomi - each surpassed 1 billion yuan in gross merchandising value (GMV), a commonly used measurement for online sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  JD.com, China's second biggest e-commerce company, did not disclose information about sales but reported a more than 20 percent year-over-year increase in shoppers over the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data provider Syntun estimated that sales across major e-commerce platforms rose 26.6 percent to 1.44 trillion yuan over the Singles Day event, which was 10 days longer than last year's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on November 11 each year in China, the Singles' Day festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year's festival, which kicked off on October 14, is the longest edition yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year, larger ticket household appliances performed better than last year, benefiting from a national 150 billion yuan trade-in subsidy scheme announced in July to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to JD.com, fast-growing home and appliance categories included energy-efficient air conditioners, robot vacuum cleaners and smart toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another consumer sector seeing unexpected growth was collectible toys and hobbies, a category that includes anime, comic and gaming-related goods popular with young people in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to figures from Alibaba, designer and collectible toy brands including MiHoYo, Pop Mart, Paperpresented and Jellycat surpassed 100 million yuan in GMV. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai on Tuesday said 35 people were killed and another 43 were injured when a car ploughed into people exercising around a sports centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  A suspect has been taken into custody, and President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to treat the injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local police said that a "serious and vicious attack" occurred at Zhuhai Sports Centre on Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said a man drove an SUV through the gate and forced his way into the sports centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 62-year-old suspect was subdued as he tried to flee the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officers added that they found him cutting himself with a knife, before they stopped him and sent him to hospital, where he is currently in a coma after self-inflicted injuries to his neck and other parts of his body.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police also said preliminary investigations suggested that the actions of the driver "stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the property division outcome of his divorce".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi gave instructions on the case and demanded that the perpetrator be severely punished according to the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also urged authorities to do more to ensure safety and protect people's lives and social stability. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The  Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) on Tuesday said that national carrier Air China would be the launch customer for the company's C929 wide-body aircraft under development that is designed to compete with twin-aisle models from Airbus and Boeing.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC's deputy director of marketing, Liu Yan, made the announcement at China's biggest air show in Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not disclose the number of aircraft Air China would purchase or planned delivery dates.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has said the C929 would have 280 to 400 seats and a range of 12,000 kilometres, which is in the same category as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The C929 was renamed in 2023 from the CR929 after Russia left a China-Russia joint venture developing the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report in April from the C929's fuselage manufacturer said it aimed to deliver the first fuselage section by September 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC deputy general manager Tong Yu in May told a group of Hong Kong reporters in Shanghai that a C929 prototype would be seen in the near future and estimated the jet could "soon" take a test flight. (Reuters)

    China announces anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry says a preliminary investigation has found that EU brandy producers were dumping certain products in China, threatening to cause substantial damage to the domestic industry. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778588_1_20241111215533.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Commerce on Monday announced it will impose temporary anti-dumping measures on certain brandy imports from the European Union (EU).
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said the decision follows a preliminary investigation that found EU brandy producers were dumping certain products in China, threatening to cause substantial damage to the domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Importers of brandy originating in the EU must place deposits with Chinese customs based on dumping margins of between 30.6 percent and 39 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures apply to grape-based spirits in containers less than 200 litres.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures follow a similar announcement made by the ministry on October 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether these measures – which will come into effect on Friday – were new or an extension of existing ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, Europe's leading producer of brandy, had described the measures announced last month as political after the EU imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles over unfair competition claims. (Xinhua/AFP)

    'Trump's victory won't diminish Sino-US tensions'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Monday said Donald Trump's victory in the American presidential election will not diminish Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the US-China tension will not change with the new president," Tang told reporters after attending a forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We always wish to cooperate and work with all the people in the world and live peacefully for the benefit of the people. But that’s not how a lot of Americans are thinking, and it is a cross-party interest. So I don’t think the tension will diminish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, I do think, I do hope that Trump will be more a US president as in being a businessman, meaning consider the interest of the people over the interest of who's threatening who."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hong Kong will face a "very challenging" situation due to tensions between China and the US. But the former chief secretary said the SAR has always survived in challenging situations and the city will overcome this time through the collective efforts of everyone in society.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tang said he believes Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong hopes the local business sector will seek changes through reform and take concrete action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia told the SAR's business community during a closed-door meeting in Shenzhen last Friday that they are the "main force" in promoting the SAR's economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said Hongkongers are always very patriotic and "very astute businessmen".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will of course support the Central People's Government and we are always supporters of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Xia Baolong. So, I'm sure all of those who went [to the meeting] will take his advice to heart and consider their actions and how to demonstrate that they have actually put into concrete action their support for the government and for the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said both government and business have to work together to boost economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's much-anticipated J-35A stealth aircraft is set to make its debut on Tuesday at the country's biggest civil and military air show - the 15th China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stealth fighter jet made its first public appearance on Friday, with broadcaster CCTV saying the jet appeared over the Zhuhai Jinwan Airport and conducted its first field adaptation training.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the centrepiece of this week's Zhuhai air show, which also marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).
  <br>
  <br>
  It will include a flying display. Another variant, the J-35, is designed for use with China's aircraft carriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35 and J-35A are designed and built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Daily news outlet said ahead of the air show that the J-35A "mainly carries out the task of seizing and maintaining air supremacy".
  <br>
  <br>
  Both J-35 variants are considerably smaller than China's other stealth aircraft, the land-based J-20 fighter. An estimated 200 J-20s are operational with the PLAAF.
  <br>
  <br>
  The J-35A is superficially similar to the Lockheed Martin F-35, whose shape - from fuselage to control surfaces - is designed to minimise how large it appears on radar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-day China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition takes place in Zhuhai from November 12-17. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday called for collaboration rather than confrontation with China after the signing of US$10 billion in new deals at a business forum in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo told the China-Indonesia business forum that Jakarta wants to be part of Beijing's emergence as not only an economic but also a "civilisational power".
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must give an example that in this modern age, collaboration – not confrontation – is the way for peace and prosperity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the forum, Gao Yunlong, chairperson of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said China is ready to work with Indonesia to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push for new achievements in bilateral trade and investment cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides should set an example of win-win cooperation among developing countries, Gao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Indonesia agreed to strengthen cooperation in key sectors, including lithium, new energy vehicles, green energy and tourism, according to a joint statement which was released after a meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prabowo on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indonesian leader on Sunday wrapped up the first stop of his first overseas trip since taking office three weeks ago. He is headed next to the United States and then to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits. (Agencies)

<img alt="A countdown ceremony was also held in Guangzhou. Screenshot from southcn.com" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778314_2_20241109221114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It's 365 days until the 15th National Games, and Hong Kong kicked off a countdown ceremony to celebrate, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will co-host the Games for the first time next year – from November 9 to 21  –  along with Guangdong and Macau.  It will also be the first time the countrywide competition will have multiple host regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight of the 34 competitive events will take place in the HKSAR, including fencing, track cycling, rugby sevens, golf, triathlon, beach volleyball, men's handball, and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the countdown ceremony at government headquarters, Chief Executive John Lee said that the government is working hard to prepare for the Games and will carry out several trial runs, starting this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's hopeful that the multi-host cities approach can boost cooperation within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay development plays a key strategic role in the country’s new development framework. By hosting the Games together, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau are deepening their collaboration in areas like culture, sports, economy, and society, promoting high-quality development across the Greater Bay Area. It’s particularly meaningful for the three places to work together towards building a top-notch Bay Area in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the National Games, Hong Kong will also host four competitive events for the National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the National Special Olympic Games in December next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee noted the government will use various channels to educate people about the events and build excitement, including banners, exhibitions, as well as activities in communities and schools.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the authorities plan to open up more volunteer positions for the Games, saying so far 30,000 people from Hong Kong have signed up, far beyond the original target of 10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's National Games will mark Hong Kong's eighth time participating in the countrywide competition, where the SAR has already won 47 medals, including 11 gold.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday evening, a countdown ceremony was also held at the Haixinsha Asian Games Park in Guangzhou, where Lee and Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng gave video speeches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mayor of Guangzhou, Sun Zhiyang, said the city will treat the one-year countdown mark as a fresh starting point and promised to stick to a green, shared, open, and connected approach to organising the Games, while making sure the event is safe, simple and still amazing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of Guangdong, Wang Weizhong, said the one-year mark shows that preparations for the Games are in the final stages and that everything is going smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will keep our promises and give our best in preparations, including building quality venues and essential facilities, coordinating, running trial runs, and providing excellent services, security, and promotion, as well as improving city infrastructure," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the State General Administration of Sports Gao Zhidan for his part said organising work are now at a critical stage and urged Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau to step up their coordination and teamwork.

 President Xi Jinping met his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Beijing on Saturday, according to Xinhua news agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly sworn-in Indonesian leader landed in China on Friday, kicking off his first overseas tour seeking a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi held a welcome ceremony for Prabowo at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, where the bilateral talks took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes the visit will take bilateral relations to a "new level".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready to work with Indonesia to take this visit as an opportunity to consolidate high-level political mutual trust," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo is also meeting Premier Li Qiang and number three official Zhao Leji on his trip, which ends on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will travel onwards to Washington, at the invitation of US President Joe Biden, as part of a world tour which will also include Peru, Brazil and Britain. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the authorities will continue to work with all sectors to enhance patriotic education in the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a photo exhibition marking the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", Chan said the move was crucial to the development of the aviation industry in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The uprising occurred on November 9, 1949, when 12 aircraft from two Nationalist-controlled airlines took off from Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, deviated from their scheduled flight paths, and instead went to join the new Communist government in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  After touching down, they were all given a hero’s welcome. Zhou Enlai, the newly appointed premier, hosted a banquet in their honor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident would become a watershed moment in Chinese history, and later deemed by Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou as "the starting point of China's civil aviation of the people with unlimited potential".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Through photo exhibitions and a microfilm, this event promotes major events to the development of the country's civil aviation industry. It's of great significance, telling the story of Hong Kong's unique contribution to this development", Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR government had been using different events and methods to promote patriotism and enhance people's sense of national identity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He went on to say that the Museum of History will set up a permanent exhibition about the history of the "Uprising of the Two Airlines", and the government will be in touch with mainland authorities on relevant materials to display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Air China's director Cui Xiaofeng reaffirmed the airline's commitment to the One Country, Two Systems principle, and said it will continue to support Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have made contributions in promoting Hong Kong's economic prosperity, social harmony and stability," he told the same event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We will] support and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub in the future, strengthening Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a super value-adder."

 China's consumer inflation rate slowed in October, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in October, down from 0.4 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as authorities on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to lift local government debt and boost spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, Beijing began unveiling fresh measures aimed at boosting economic activity,  including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. (AFP)

<img alt="Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, says business leaders in the SAR are the main force in promoting economic development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top Beijing official on Hong Kong affairs has urged the local business community to see the SAR as their home, while consolidating the city's traditional advantages, during a closed-door exchange in Shenzhen, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), on Friday also told business magnates and entrepreneurs that they are the "main force" in promoting economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Business leaders] must stand firm in treating Hong Kong as their home and utilising Hong Kong to prosper, consolidate and enhance Hong Kong's traditional advantages," Xia was quoted as saying by the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's business community and entrepreneurs are the main force in promoting economic development. They have made outstanding contributions to maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and assisting in the country's modernisation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said Xia told those at the exchange to support the SAR government in implementing its long-term development plans, and tell the good Hong Kong story and safeguard the city's international image, among other things.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who was in attendance with his principal officials, said his administration will unite and lead all sectors of Hong Kong to implement reforms and "break new ground" in the city's development, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Jonathan Choi, who was among 29 business leaders at the meeting, said discussions focused on their role in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Hong Kong's economy relies on entrepreneurs, [Xia] hopes that entrepreneurs will go all out and follow the central government's strategy," Choi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Importers' and Exporters’ Association, said the Beijing official noted that the city had gone through trials and tribulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xia said] the current situation in Hong Kong has been stable, and we should take advantage of this period of transitioning from stability to prosperity to do our best," Pui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other business leaders and property tycoons included Richard Li, who chairs Pacific Century Group; Peter Lee, co-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land; and Raymond Kwok, chairman and managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  They attended a full-day symposium and joined a dinner, with HKMAO executive deputy director Zhou Ji and the head of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong, Zheng Yanxiong, who also took part in the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a trip to Hong Kong in February, Xia also focused on the city's economic developments. Last month, the senior Beijing official separately met executives of Jardine Matheson and HSBC in Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's lawmakers have approved a bill to raise the ceiling on local government debt by six trillion yuan to replace existing hidden debts, an official said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation's top legislative body, the standing committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), approved the bill during a meeting from November 4 to 8, said Xu Hongcai, vice chairman of the financial and economic affairs committee of the NPC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, who made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing, added that the debt swap would help resolve local debt risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same press conference, Finance Minister Lan Foan said "hidden debt" of local governments stood at 14.3 trillion yuan at the end of 2023, which authorities planned to trim to 2.3 trillion yuan by 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan also said authorities will issue policies to support state sector purchases of unsold apartments and reclaim undeveloped residential land from property developers, as well as replenish the capital of big state banks, but did not give details on the size or timing of those measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV described the move as China's "most powerful debt reduction measure in recent years", adding the move would free "up space for local governments to better develop the economy and protect people's livelihood".
  <br>
  <br>
  At the closing NPC meeting, lawmakers also voted to adopt a preschool education law, and revised laws on anti-money laundering, the protection of cultural relics, and mineral resources, as well as an energy law.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping signed seven presidential orders to promulgate the laws and the decisions. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping will travel to Peru and Brazil next week for meetings of Apec and the G20, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi will go to Lima from November 13 to 17 and Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Peru, Xi will "attend the 31st Apec Economic Leaders' Meeting and pay a state visit", Hua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will then travel to Rio de Janeiro from November 17 to 21 to attend the 19th G20 Summit and will pay a state visit to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Hua added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is Brazil's top trading partner, exceeding US$180 billion in each-way trade in 2023, with semiconductors, phones and pharmaceuticals dominating exports to the South American country.
  <br>
  <br>
  A visit this year by Vice President Geraldo Alckmin was seen as paving the way for Brazil to join China's massive Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of South American nations, including Peru, have already signed up to the initiative. (AFP/Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday hosted the inaugural Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area Lawyers Exchange Reception.
 <br>
  <br>
  More than 150 people from the legal sectors of the mainland, Macau and Hong Kong, including Director-General of the Department of Justice of Guangdong Chen Xudong, attended the reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the event, Deputy Secretary for Justice Horace Cheung said that the establishment of a platform to enable the industry to better participate in the development of the bay area is an important measure in the Department of Justice’s Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the platform aims to consolidate the professional strengths of the legal services to give full play to the unique strengths of lawyers in the GBA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheung also said that the platform, along with the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy – which will be launched shortly – will enable Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's leading chipmaker SMIC announced on Thursday a sharp rise in profits over the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  SMIC said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday that its third-quarter profit attributable to owners of the company stood at US$148.8 million, a jump of 58.3 percent compared to the equivalent period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said its revenue rose to nearly US$2.2 billion, a record high and the first time it had raked in over US$2 billion in a single quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results marked a return to form for the chipmaker after chalking up a nearly 60 percent year-on-year decline in profit in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it expected revenue growth to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, adding that it would "strengthen our confidence in development, maintain our strategic focus, stabilise our market share and consolidate our position in the industry". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports surged last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, easily topping forecasts and providing optimism about the economy as officials steel for a potential trade war with the United States after Donald Trump was re-elected president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 12.7 percent in October from a year earlier to US$309.1 billion, according to customs data released on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is the best since July 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports to the US rose 8.1 percent while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months," Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports, meanwhile, fell 2.3 percent, turning negative for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$95.7 billion in October, up from US$81.7 billion in September. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping congratulated Donald Trump on his re-election to the White House, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi said China-US cooperation is a long-term goal and the two countries should strengthen dialogue between them while properly managing their differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said history shows the two sides "gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation", according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said a stable, sound and sustainable China-US relationship serves their shared interests and meets the aspiration of the international community.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed the hope that Beijing and Washington will uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.

  Vice President Han Zheng, meanwhile, extended congratulations to JD Vance on his election as vice president of the United States. (Reporting by Xinhua)

    'Second Trump term less impactful on China than first'

<img alt="US President-elect Donald Trump has proposed imposing tariffs of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777931_1_20241107102855.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator warned of incoming tariffs and trade disputes between China and the United States when Donald Trump moves back into the White House, with Washington's relations with the broader Asia-Pacific region turning frosty.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incoming US president had previously proposed imposing across-the-board tariffs of between 10 and 20 percent on all imports arriving into the nation, and tariffs of at least 60 percent on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump first launched a trade war with China in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, said another Trump presidency is going to have economic implications because of the Republican's "America First" policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it would have less impact on China than during Trump's first term in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things have changed dramatically since that period of time. The US had a lot more leverage. Now, China has been growing its trade with the rest of the world at a double-digit pace," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite frankly, the US cannot be decoupled from China, even if they start buying from somewhere else as they have been... the fact is many of the intermediate goods are still manufactured in China."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also expected a shift in the Asia-Pacific region's relations with the US under a second Trump presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not interested in coalitions or anything like that... he's going to blame Asean, in particular, saying there's a trade imbalance, that it's unfair, that they have to pay more if they want security, and that they have to do something to mend America's broken economy," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong-based political expert on Wednesday said Republican Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election would add uncertainty to Sino-American ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There's no guaranteed outcome... It's going to be an incredibly unpredictable and volatile four years, with more trade protectionism and tariffs, with potential escalation and flare-ups over geopolitical fault lines near China," Brian Wong, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and a fellow at the Centre on Contemporary China and the World at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong likened Trump's return to the White House to a game of Russian roulette for Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that Trump's backers included many China hawks, such as former US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and former acting US director of national intelligence Richard Grenell, as well as those with business interests in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Donald Trump also has enduring ties with many prominent businessmen with sizeable corporate interests and commercial interests in China, including (Blackstone CEO) Stephen Schwarzman and also (Tesla CEO) Elon Musk," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So how these different factions and also voices in his likely administration makeup and also in a circle of advisors on China influences him, that remains to be seen."

 China said on Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump appeared on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao did not comment directly on the possibility of Trump's re-election, but said "the United States presidential election is an internal affair of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We respect the choice of the American people," she said. "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice," she added when asked if President Xi Jinping would call Trump to congratulate him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Shanghai-based firms that are taking part in a national expo said they plan on expanding their reach into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob Technology and Faraconix are among the firms that have signed cooperation agreements at the China International Import Expo.
  <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob produces AI-powered robots that can be sent into isolation wards to conduct simple medical procedures, such as checking the temperature and radiation levels of cancer patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the effort of letting our robots running inside Hong Kong hospitals, hopefully we can combine with more technologies in the world," the firm's founder, Pan Jing, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faraconix – which produces semiconductors for smartphones and computers – plans to expand into Hong Kong this month and invest more than HK$100 million in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its founder, Chi Law, is from Hong Kong and started the firm in Shanghai four years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of coming to Hong Kong is to bring some communication products for use in the future, such as what's known as millimetre wave, or [products] in the 6G era, as well as satellite communication chips," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said despite the global competition in chip making, he expressed confidence that his company can come up with chips and tech that are better than those in the US in two to three years.

 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China must combat rising unilateralism by opening up further to trade and investment, Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country will look to upgrade its free trade zones and further explore free trade and investment agreements with other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the face of the current impasses of global development, no one can stay unaffected and no one can solve these problems on their own,” Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only by steadfastly embracing openness and cooperation and working together in unity can we harness the immense strength of all humanity to collectively to foster global development and prosperity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence over the nation's ability to meet its growth target and its economic prospects in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Li pointed out there have been many positive developments in the nation’s economy indicating a favourable outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also had fiscal and monetary tools at their disposal, he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-18 manned mission returned to Earth early on Monday after more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu are "in good physical condition," after touching down in the return capsule of their Shenzhou spaceship at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the capsule, the trio thanked the country and the people, saying they hope to continue contributing to the country's space programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Manned Space Agency described the mission as "a complete success".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future," Ye said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Cong, who has just completed his first-ever space adventure, said that the crew was united as one and worked closely with the ground team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Guangsu also returned from his first spaceflight. "We have all enjoyed the unique experience of weightlessness. It is exciting to return to Earth, but we are also unwilling to part the wonders of the space," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio later arrived in Beijing by plane. They will enter a period of medical quarantine and undergo comprehensive medical examinations and health evaluations, and meet with the press afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men had travelled to Tiangong in late April and were met on October 30 by three new astronauts, with whom they conducted a five-day handover before making their return journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing earlier said it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has vowed to diversify the SAR's economy, a day after receiving his formal appointment letter from Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said on Saturday that he was deeply honoured for his official appointment as the chief executive for the sixth term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping met Sam, a former Macau top judge, in Beijing on Friday, saying the central government fully endorses and trusts the incoming chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon returning to Macau, Sam pledged to accurately and comprehensively implement One Country, Two Systems, safeguard national security, and support growth of its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic diversification is an issue of great concern to President Xi and central authorities. We must continue to create conditions on this front in the future, and steadily promote economic diversification," Sam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the new government set to be sworn in on December 20, Sam said he aimed to hand in a list of the proposed governing team to Beijing within a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won 394 votes from a 400-strong election committee in the CE election on October 13.

 President Xi Jinping on Friday met Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

  Xi added that Beijing will continue to firmly implement the principles of One Country, Two Systems; Macau people governing Macau; and a high degree of autonomy.

  Sam said he was deeply honoured and keenly aware of the responsibility, pledging to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan says it's extraordinary that Hong Kong scientists are joining the country's latest Antarctica exploration, with icebreakers Xuelong and Xuelong 2 setting sail along with a third ship on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mission to the South Pole is China's 41st and will last for more than half a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the ships' journey, Chan said Hongkongers' participation in the mission marks an important milestone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only does this show the country's recognition of Hong Kong's polar scientific research, it also highlights how the SAR can play a pro-active role in the country's scientific research missions," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan expressed the hope that local scientists can make full use of the country's platform to conduct solid research and make greater contributions to the nation in science and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that this year is the 40th anniversary of the start of China's polar expeditions, saying the country's efforts and achievements attract global attention and reflect a powerful nation's responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

    Yao Ming steps down as Chinese basketball chief

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation has conducted its first dual aircraft carrier formation exercise in the South China Sea, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV said the drills involving the Liaoning and Shandong that took place "in an area of the South China Sea" intended to "hone and enhance the combat capability of the aircraft carrier formation system”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post accompanied by a video of jets taking off from and landing on the two carriers, CCTV said the exercises also took place in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Xinhua News Agency said the drills “featured multiple subjects under real-combat circumstances”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports did not specify when the exercises took place, though they said the broader naval mission had overlapped with public holidays that spanned late September to October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, having been commissioned in 2012. The Shandong entered service in 2019, while a third carrier, the Fujian, is undergoing sea trials. (Additional reporting by AFP)

 Beijing on Thursday said it was "concerned" over the situation on the Korean Peninsula, after Pyongyang said it had test-fired one of its most powerful missiles to boost its nuclear deterrent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch was North Korea's first weapons test since being accused of sending soldiers to Russia, with South Korea's military saying that its "initial judgement" was that the projectile may have been a "new solid-propelled long-range ballistic missile".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it was "concerned about developments on the [Korean] peninsula".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... has consistently maintained that preserving peace and stability on the peninsula and promoting the process of political resolution to the peninsula issue aligns with the common interests of all parties," ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope all parties will make efforts toward this goal," he told a regular press briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch came hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, warning that North Korean soldiers in Russian uniforms were being deployed for possible action against Ukraine. (AFP)

 A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
 <br>
  <br>
  The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-19 spaceflight mission have entered the Tiangong space station and met with three others, starting a new round of in-orbit crew handover.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-18 crew opened the hatch at 12.51pm on Wednesday (Beijing time) and greeted the new arrivals, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six crew members then took group pictures for the fifth space get-together in China's aerospace history. They will live and work together for about five days to complete planned tasks and handover work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 astronauts – Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze – will stay at the Tiangong space station for approximately six months and conduct a series of experiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 blasted off early Wednesday morning atop a Long March-2F rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  China declared the launch a "complete success".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-18 crew, meanwhile, is set to return to Earth on Monday. (Reporting by Xinhua)
