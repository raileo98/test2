 Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Beijing on Thursday, vowing to deepen cooperation and strategic coordination.
 <br>
  <br>
  “China is willing to work with France to enhance dialogue across all domains and levels, transcend differences, and deepen cooperation,” Wang said, adding that both countries should “assume the responsibility of major nations” and support each other’s multilateral initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrot praised the “pragmatic cooperation” between France and China, emphasizing that amid rising global uncertainty and protectionism, “France-China relations are even more important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He reaffirmed France’s commitment to the one-China policy, support for free trade, and opposition to decoupling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed China-EU relations, agreeing on the need for dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed that “cooperation outweighs competition, and consensus surpasses differences,” while Barrot voiced support for EU-China dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the talks, China and France issued a joint statement on climate change. (Xinhua)

    Beijing offices again question CK Hutchison ports deal

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The latest Ta Kung Pao article reposted by Beijing offices in Hong Kong said CK Hutchison's ports deal didn't make business sense. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797760_1_20250328011558.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Central government bodies in charge of Hong Kong affairs on Thursday reposted another news article criticising a controversial deal by CK Hutchison’s to sell dozens of ports – including strategic assets along the Panama Canal – to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoted business experts who questioned whether the Li Ka-shing-owned conglomerate had gotten the best deal it could have, stressing that businesses should “stand with the nation in the face of hegemonic bullying.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The article noted that public opinions that the sale did not appear to conform to the business logic of maximising profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Not only is the valuation of the assets low, but the decision was made very quickly, without adopting the ‘highest-bidder wins principle,” the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Western media reports have also pointed out that the US consortium had gotten a bargain.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ta Kung Pao report also quoted Bai Ming, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Commerce’s International Market Research Institute, as saying the deal was done “quickly and cheaply”, noting that CK Hutchison did not launch a global bidding race to find the best deal to maximise profits as logic would dictate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said businessmen in Hong Kong should learn from the example of firms that had faced “unreasonable suppression” from the United States and yet chose to stand with the nation and prospered with the country’s support.
  <br>
  <br>
  A member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Su Qingdong, was quoted as saying that all sectors of society expect the relevant firm to reconsider the deal from the country’s perspective, though there has not been a positive response so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the fourth Ta Kung Pao article lashing out against the sale that had been reposted by both the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here.

 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China warned on Thursday a trade war would have "no winners" after US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent import tariffs on foreign-made cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariffs won't help Washington solve its own problems, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also rebuffed a suggestion from Trump that he might offer to reduce tariffs on the country to get Beijing's approval for the sale of popular social media platform TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its position on the tariff issue is consistent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said China is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Innovation is driving China's economy: Ding Xuexiang

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Thursday said China's economy is remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to dignitaries and business leaders from around the world at the Boao Forum for Asia being held in Hainan, he said this ability has helped the nation tide over economic difficulties and lifted its medium-to-long-term growth prospects and potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China’s firm commitment to an innovation-driven development strategy has led to… a boost in our innovation capacity and a successful transition from old to new growth drivers,” Ding said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, the pursuit of high quality development has become a nationwide consensus and the drive to develop new quality productive forces and spur innovation has become a widespread trend.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that China ranks among the world's fastest growing major economies, and accounts for about 30 percent of global growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also said the nation’s economy has a stronger outlook and that despite a surge of difficulties and challenges, the economy hit its target of five percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member called on Asian leaders attending the forum to safeguard stability in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Asia has a stabilising role and that this must be "dearly cherished".
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even as we speak, changes of the world, of our times, and of historic significance are unfolding in unprecedented ways. Our world is experiencing far greater instability and uncertainty,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should... act as builders and guardians of regional peace and make sure Asia continues to be a land of peace and stability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Solidarity and cooperation must be strengthened to build an Asian community with a shared future, Ding added.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.

  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.

 Electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman has told analysts on an earnings call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see "a substantial rise" in its market share in Britain, which is "very open" to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also sees "great opportunities" to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tuesday meeting, Wang also told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD's profits coming from overseas markets "at a certain stage".
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ta Kung Pao newspaper on Wednesday renewed its criticism of the sale by CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial, Ta Kung Pao said there would be severe consequences if the conglomerate continues on this "wrong path".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the deal to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by the American firm BlackRock should not be considered a normal business decision on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also said the proposed sale undermined China's national interests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of directly qualifying for the 2026 World Cup took a hit after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Australia on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jackson Irvine scored a brilliant curling shot to open the scoring for the Aussies in the 16th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  An error by China’s goalkeeper Wang Dalei shocked the home crowds at Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium 13 minutes later, as he let a weak shot by Nishan Velupillay slip through his fingers.
  <br>
  <br>
  China made four changes after the break and threw bodies forward in search of a goal but those efforts were in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the loss, the national team stayed at the bottom of the group of six, seven points behind second place Australia with two matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two teams of the group directly qualify for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  China now need to fight for a fourth-place finish in the group to advance to the fourth qualifying round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their two remaining group matches are against Indonesia and Bahrain.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the forum was Chief Executive John Lee, who said Hong Kong is a global city connecting the world, and that the SAR will continue to promote free trade and market liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are devoted to deepening international exchange and collaboration. Hong Kong has signed investment agreements covering 33 economies, and free trade agreements covering 21 economies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aspire to add the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade pact – to our free trade agreements soon, and better contribute to regional cooperation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Beijing is willing to work with Portugal to build a more stable, fruitful and dynamic relationship, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Portuguese counterpart in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is also willing to work with Portugal to promote China and Europe to become strategic partners with mutual trust, Wang said, adding that China supports Europe in maintaining its "strategic autonomy", according to a ministry statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China regards Europe as an important pole in a multipolar world, and supports Europe in maintaining its strategic autonomy," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Portugal's Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel is visiting China this week, the first to the nation by a high-level Portuguese government official in over five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top officials in Beijing and European capitals are looking at each other with renewed interest as US President Donald Trump's administration threatens to upend transatlantic ties and global trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from Rangel, the French foreign minister and Italy's Senate president are all scheduled to visit China this week. (Reuters)

 Chinese authorities have released all employees of a US corporate due diligence firm detained in Beijing two years ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  The detained Beijing employees at Mintz Group, all Chinese nationals, have been freed, a company official said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  News of their release came on the heels of the just-concluded China Development Forum in Beijing attended by dozens of foreign chief executives, a platform that Chinese officials had used to bring home the message that China is open to foreign capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful to the Chinese authorities that our former colleagues can now be home with their families," the Mintz official said in an email.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mintz has 12 offices around the world and more than 280 investigators, according to its website. (Reuters)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

    Venezuelan oil tariffs condemned as 'illegal'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Tuesday called on the United States to stop interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs and abolish the "illegal" unilateral sanctions on the South American country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The call came soon after US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas, a punitive measure that could hit China and India, among others, and sow fresh global trade uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has unleashed tariffs on US allies and foes alike, attempting to strong-arm both economic and diplomatic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest across-the-board 25 percent levies targeting direct and indirect buyers of Venezuelan oil can take effect as soon as April 2, according to an order signed on Monday by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The secretary of state, in consultation with other US agencies, is authorised to determine if the levy will be imposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could hit China and India, with experts noting that Venezuela exports oil to both those countries, and to the United States and Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters on Monday that the 25 percent tariff would be on top of existing rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February, Venezuela exported some 500,000 barrels of oil per day to China and this figure was 240,000 barrels for the United States, experts told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has dubbed April 2 "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy, already promising reciprocal tariffs tailored to each trading partner in an effort to remedy practices that Washington deem unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  He earlier signaled sector-specific duties coming around the same day -- but the White House said on Monday it might take a narrower approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Monday announcement on Truth Social involving Venezuela, the president cited "numerous reasons" for what he called a "secondary tariff."
  <br>
  <br>
  He accused Venezuela of "purposefully and deceitfully" sending "undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals" to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in his post that "Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Trump's order, the 25 percent tariff expires a year after the last date that a country has imported Venezuelan oil -- or sooner if Washington decides so.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement comes as the deportation pipeline between the United States and Venezuela was suspended last month when he claimed Caracas had not lived up to a deal to quickly receive deported migrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela subsequently said it would no longer accept the flights.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Caracas said on Saturday it had reached agreement with Washington to resume repatriations after which nearly 200 Venezuelan citizens were deported from the United States via Honduras.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately on Monday, the Trump administration extended US oil giant Chevron's deadline to halt its operations in Venezuela through May 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had been operating in Venezuela under a sanctions waiver.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's latest move adds to tariffs he has vowed would start on or around April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides reciprocal tariffs, he has promised sweeping sector-specific duties hitting imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  As things stand, however, his plans for the day might become more targeted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sector-specific tariffs "may or may not happen April 2," a White House official told AFP, adding that the situation is "still fluid."
  <br>
  <br>
  The official reaffirmed that reciprocal tariffs would take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump told reporters on Monday he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  He separately added that he would announce car tariffs "very shortly" and those on pharmaceuticals sometime down the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  US partners are furthering talks with Washington as deadlines loom, with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic heading to the country on Tuesday to meet his American counterparts -- Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout gave financial markets a boost.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo last week that Washington would go to trading partners with an indication of where tariff levels and non-tariff barriers are.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stopped their practices, Bessent added, they could potentially avoid levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same interview, Bessent noted that levies would be focused on about 15 percent of countries who have trade imbalances with the United States, dubbing these a "dirty 15." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Monday said it will implement a more proactive fiscal policy this year, with finance minister Lan Fo'an saying the nation's economic and fiscal strengths have grown significantly.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the last day of the China Development Forum 2025, Lan said China has gained more experience in macroeconomic management and fiscal governance, and that confidence in the nation's economic development stems from solid fundamentals, numerous advantages, resilience, and vast potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Lan said the primary task of this year's fiscal policy is to significantly boost consumption and enhance investment efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has the world's most promising super-sized market, with immense potential for consumption growth," Lan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to global business leaders attending the forum, Lan also emphasised that China will ensure equal treatment for all types of businesses and continue to improve the business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, senior executives of multinational giants attending the forum have highlighted the importance of strengthening global cooperation to ensure that industrial and supply chains can withstand unexpected external shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives told broadcaster CCTV that this meant that they have to come together across borders and industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judy Marks, CEO of Otis Worldwide Corporation noted there is a tremendous supply chain for the elevator industry on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is our largest manufacturing location anywhere in the world. And so we take advantage of the supply chain here not just for China in China, but also in China for the world," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Entrepreneurs, government officials, experts and business representatives from China and around the world attended the two-day forum – themed "Unleashing Development Momentum for Stable Growth of Global Economy".

 China has not received any application for asylum from Philippines' former President Rodrigo Duterte and his family, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Duterte's trip to Hong Kong was for his personal holidays, ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told a regular press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president was arrested on March 11 at Manila's main airport on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of its probe into a "war on drugs" that defined his presidency. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong on Monday welcomed last week's remarks from the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, who praised EuroCham's work in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong told a visiting EuroCham delegation to Beijing that Hong Kong had the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , EuroCham chairman Inaki Amate said the most important takeaway from the meeting was the central government's commitment to the long-term stability and prosperity of the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had an opportunity to express our commitment to the Hong Kong SAR and to the measures that the Hong Kong and Chinese government are putting forward to ensure the long term stability that we need in the business community."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amate also said the European Chamber of Commerce was working hard to encourage companies from Europe to set up operations in the city and contribute to its success.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [firms] see that the potential of Hong Kong has not vanished. That there is still a lot that Hong Kong can offer to international firms in the way they can penetrate back into China but also can consider Hong Kong as a regional headquarters."

<img alt="Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen celebrates after winning the men’s 1500m final during the Indoor World Athletics Championships in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797058_1_20250323214422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m in Nanjing on Sunday to claim not only a first global gold in his favoured distance, but also a rare world indoor track distance double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, who had won the 3,000m on Saturday for his first world indoor title, clocked 3min 38.79sec to emulate the double claimed by Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie in Maebashi in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Neil Gourley took silver in 3:39.07 while American Luke Houser rounded out the podium (3:39.17).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is something special," said Ingebrigtsen, before adding: "A lot of things have changed and I'm not doing this because anyone else has done it before. So that's purely a coincidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to compare yourself against history and what others are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm only focusing on myself and I feel good to have done a lot of preparations, and that was always the main goal. It's not to do with something somebody else did before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I can do more, so I'll try to maximise that and grab the opportunity given to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen's victory also banished some of the Norwegian's 1,500m demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main goal is obviously to win both distances, but I would say so far a pretty good indoor season, getting out and succeeding with the things that I wanted to accomplish, so it's been good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, as his wont, was happy to sit at the back of the nine-strong pack as American Samuel Prakel took up the running in Nanjing, splitting the pack into single file.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian moved to the front with four laps to run, Britain's Gourley on his shoulder and Mariano Garcia of Spain also in the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen surged again, shouldering off Austrian veteran Raphael Pallitsch's clumsy attempt at a pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to try their luck was Portugal's Isaac Nader, but at the bell it was Ingebrigtsen in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gourley raced down the inside line of the far straight, but there was to be no Briton to spoil the party at the line, as there has been twice at the world outdoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian kept not only his speed but also his nerve to see off his rivals, crossing the finish line with a brief look over his shoulder and a wagging index finger. (AFP)

 Former Masters champion Patrick Reed qualified for the British Open after coming second behind fellow LIV player Carlos Ortiz at the International Series Macau on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican Ortiz also earned his spot at the major in Portrush, Northern Ireland, in July, after holding off the American for a three-shot victory at the Asian Tour event in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Kokrak also qualified as he finished third at Macau Golf and Country Club, three shots further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was one shot ahead of the 2017 Masters champion and another LIV player in Sergio Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard missed a three-footer for birdie on the last which would have seen him tie with Kokrak and secure a place at the British Open through countback based on his higher world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau tournament was added this year to the Open Qualifying Series for the first time, with the top three players who are not already exempt earning a berth at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  LIV players do not earn world-ranking points, severely restricting their chances of qualifying for golf's four major tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ortiz carded a final-round six-under-par 64 to triumph with a total 22-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, had shared the lead with Ortiz heading into the final round but had to settle for a runner-up finish after carding a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed's best performance at the British Open was 10th in 2019. (AFP)

<img alt="McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix with second placed McLaren's Lando Norris and third placed Mercedes' George Russell. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797037_1_20250323172831.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri led from pole to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren used a one-stop strategy to complete a dominant one-two with Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  George Russell was third in a Mercedes with Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen snatching fourth place after a thrilling late pass on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton came home sixth behind his teammate after his first Ferrari victory in Saturday's sprint race in Shanghai, when Piastri had been second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an incredible weekend, the car has been pretty mega," said the Australian Piastri, who had been running second a week ago in Melbourne' season-opener before a late spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very, very happy. The hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, so to go all the way to the end was a bit of a surprise, but a happy surprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris had to cope with a late brake issue which forced him to settle for second rather than challenge his teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton continues to lead the championship after two race weekends on 44 points from Verstappen on 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell started from second and knew it was imperative to try to grab the lead off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead he was squeezed by Piastri on the long first bend complex, which allowed Norris to surge past into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ferraris got past Verstappen on the same bend, relegating the world champion from fourth to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc lost part of his front wing when it brushed Hamilton's rear right wheel but it did not affect his pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton was the first of the front-runners to dive in for new rubber on lap 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the others followed for hard tyres with Russell getting past Norris in the melee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the McLaren showed superior pace and surged back past at the end of the pit straight with the help of DRS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton began to struggle on the hard compound and allowed his teammate past on lap 21 freeing Leclerc to go after Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 38 Hamilton had to pit again for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front five all stayed out as it became clear they were going to attempt to make the hard tyres last till the end of the 56 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen had nursed his tyres throughout the race which enabled him to have a late charge on Leclerc and pass the Ferrari at the start of lap 54.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haas finished with two cars in the points as Esteban Ocon was seventh and rookie Ollie Bearman 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other points scorers were Mercedes teenager Kimi Antonelli in eighth with Alex Albon ninth in his Williams on his 29th birthday. (AFP)

    China prepared for 'shocks' of trade war: Premier Li

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang told a gathering of business executives in Beijing on Sunday that China will adhere to the correct direction of economic globalisation, practise true multilateralism and strive to be a force for stability and certainty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering the opening address to the China Development Forum, Li called on global executives to capture the opportunities from the country's renewed innovation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forum this year saw attendance by prominent business leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said that the country would pursue economic globalisation despite "fragmentation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have preparations for possible unexpected shocks, which of course mainly come from external sources. Where necessary, the Chinese government will also introduce new policies to ensure the smooth operation of the Chinese economy," Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump since taking office in January amount to a 20 percent blanket hike on Chinese exports to the United States. Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs on American goods, including on US agricultural goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li underlined Beijing's commitment to opening up the economy and called on global businesses to resist "protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Vice Premier He Lifeng said that China is willing to "engage in candid dialogue" with the United States to resolve issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two countries have "many common interests and broad space for cooperation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Senator Steve Daines on Saturday met with He, during a visit to Beijing viewed as a bid to ease strained relations. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan visited two mainland firms in Beijing on Friday, highlighting Hong Kong's role as a gateway for business expansion and global market access.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan first visited a leading pop-culture entertainment company listed in Hong Kong, which operates popular intellectual property (IP) artistic toys. He toured the company's thematic park and met with senior management to discuss their business development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He welcomed the firm's plans to expand its physical retail network in Hong Kong and diversify services, noting that the SAR government is reviewing tax deductions for acquiring IP usage rights to boost the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, Chan visited a high-precision artificial intelligence (AI) firm specialising in intelligent sensing solutions for smart traffic management, autonomous driving, perception robots, and low-altitude economic applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, with projects in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, plans to establish its international headquarters and a global R&D centre in Hong Kong while preparing for a listing. Chan encouraged the firm to utilise Hong Kong's capital, talent, and professional services to expand internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan was due to attend the China Development Forum on Saturday and speak at the thematic seminar.

<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi and South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul shake hands as Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya looks on. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796925_1_20250322153847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday that China, Japan and the South Korea have agreed to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, and deepen cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang made the remarks in Tokyo while meeting the press together with Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, after attending the 11th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the three countries fully affirmed the positive progress made in their cooperation since the Ninth China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit, Wang said they agreed that against the backdrop of a complex and turbulent international landscape and sluggish recovery of the world economy, it is necessary and responsible for the three sides to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation, and provide more stabilising factors for regional peace and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  First, Wang said, they agreed to consolidate the momentum of cooperation. The three countries will stay true to the original aspiration of cooperation, focus on the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade, and expand new areas, cultivate new growth drivers, and create new highlights of cooperation on the basis of implementing the cooperation centred on six key areas determined by the leaders' meeting last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three parties had useful communication on holding the 10th China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit this year, and will strive to create favourable conditions and atmosphere for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second, they agreed to promote regional economic integration. The three countries will continue to communicate on restarting the negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement, promoting the expansion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and maintaining the stability and smoothness of regional production and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three countries will keep pace with the times to build a highland of scientific and technological innovation in Asia and promote the development of new quality productive forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third, they agreed to deepen exchanges and mutual learning. The three countries will hold the China-Japan-ROK Year of Cultural Exchange from 2025 to 2026, strive to increase the number of people-to-people exchanges among the three countries to 40 million by 2030, and consolidate the public opinion basis for trilateral cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strengthening cooperation in social welfare, green and low-carbon development and other fields can bring more and better benefits to the people of the three countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth, they agreed to enhance multilateral cooperation. The three countries will strengthen coordination and cooperation under mechanisms such as ASEAN Plus Three and the East Asia Summit, promote "Trilateral+X Cooperation" to the surrounding areas, and drive common development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will support each other in hosting Apec meetings, promote open regionalism, uphold multilateralism and free trade, and push for more universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that the three countries fully affirmed the work of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat, and agreed to extend the term of the Secretariat's consultative committee, looking forward to the Secretariat playing a greater role in promoting trilateral cooperation. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Japan should enhance mutual trust and cooperation to provide global stability amid complex international challenges, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang, also a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau, made the remarks during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted that since Ishiba took office, China-Japan ties have improved, highlighted by a productive meeting between President Xi Jinping and the Japanese leader in Lima, Peru.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Japan, both with important influence, should work together to build a better future for Asia, Wang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged Japan to uphold the principles of four key political documents, safeguard the political and legal foundations of bilateral ties, and honour commitments on historical issues, including Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for constructive engagement as the 80th anniversary of Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression approaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba reiterated Japan's commitment to strengthening ties, recognising the significance of bilateral agreements, and deepening cooperation to benefit both nations. (Xinhua)

<img alt="Lewis Hamilton in a Ferrari during the sprint qualifier. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796819_1_20250321175331.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "gobsmacked" Lewis Hamilton obliterated the Shanghai lap record to take a stunning pole position on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix sprint in only his second race weekend with Ferrari.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, who has won a record six Chinese Grands Prix, flew round the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit in 1min 30.849sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lap easily beat the 1:32.238 set in 2004 at the inaugural Chinese GP by fellow seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, also in a Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who won both the sprint and main race in China last year, was second fastest 0.018sec behind and McLaren's Oscar Piastri was third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles Leclerc was fourth as Ferrari showed a big improvement from Melbourne, where Hamilton was 10th and Leclerc eighth -- the Scuderia's worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just a bit gobsmacked, taken back by it. I didn't know when we would get to this position," said Hamilton, who emerged from his car to a huge ovation from the Chinese fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started out straight away with a better feeling in the car. I can't believe we are at the front, ahead of a McLaren which has been so fast throughout winter testing, Australia and even today."
  <br>
  <br>
  A big surprise was Melbourne winner Lando Norris, whose McLaren had been fastest by almost half a second in morning practice ahead of Leclerc, Piastri and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris was sixth after he ran wide and aborted his final flying lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made a mistake. I locked up in the last corner," admitted Norris, who complained his car was not to his liking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just too many mistakes but just too difficult of a car to drive," the Englishman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he was fortunate to be second on the grid for the sprint race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lap was very good. I don't even think we should have been on the front row anyway so I'm very happy to be second," said the four-time world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell was fifth with his teammate Kimi Antonelli seventh behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda's RB, Alex Albon's Williams and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin rounded out the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was difficult to understand the difference between Friday's sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes McLaren had a huge gap, sometimes not so. Let's analyse it. We have a lot of work to do," Vasseur told Sky Sports F1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it's a good feeling and gives a positive energy to the team and Lewis, but I always see the negative side."
  <br>
  <br>
  All the cars were obligated to run medium-compound tyres in the first two sprint qualifying sessions, termed SQ1 and SQ2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson had a bad start to his weekend, failing to get out of the first session after having a lap time deleted for exceeding track limits and the New Zealander will start 20th and last.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated after the first session were the Alpine pair of Jack Doohan and Pierre Gasly, Haas's Esteban Ocon and the Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  In SQ2, Fernando Alonso was 11th in the Aston Martin and missed out on the top-10 shootout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated were Oliver Bearman's Haas, the Williams of Carlos Sainz, Gabriel Bortoleto in a Sauber and Isack Hadjar's RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the Chinese Grand Prix over 56 laps. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday demanded protections for Chinese students in the US after a congressional panel asked six American universities to hand over a large amount of detailed information on their students, citing national security concerns.
 <br>
  <br>
  A letter sent to the universities, including Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, alleged that the Chinese government was embedding researchers in top American institutions to gain direct access to sensitive technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Chinese students account for about one-quarter of all international students in the US and that their activities have promoted “the economic prosperity and technological development of the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is in the interest of both parties," Mao told reporters at a daily briefing. "We urge the US to stop overstretching the concept of national security, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students, and not impose discriminatory restrictive measures on Chinese students.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Her remarks came a day after John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to six colleges requesting information on Chinese students enrolled in advanced science and technology programs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The colleges named in Moolenaar's letter were Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described America’s student visa system as a Trojan horse for Beijing, providing unrestricted access to the country's top research institutions and posing a direct threat to national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The letter requested information including the Chinese students' sources of funding, the types of research they're involved in, what schools they previously attended, and “a country-by-country breakdown of applicants, admittances, and enrolments at your university.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill seeking to ban Chinese students from studying in US schools. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong has the full support from the central government in maintaining its unique status and advantages, a senior Beijing official told a visiting business delegation from the SAR on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comment during a meeting with representatives of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (EuroCham) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  He appreciated EuroCham's positive assessment of China and the SAR, and praised its contributions in promoting long-term investment from European enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as cooperation between the city and the European business sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government firmly supports the accurate and resolute implementation of 'one country, two systems'...and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, while maintaining a free, open and rule-based business environment," an article published by the office read.
  <br>
  <br>
  In return, EuroCham told Xia that it has full confidence in Hong Kong, and pledged to bring in more investments, companies and talent from Europe to the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it acted in accordance with the law over the execution of four Canadian citizens in recent weeks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in Ottawa on Wednesday that China had executed four Canadian citizens in recent weeks, defying pleas from Ottawa for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly condemn the executions that did happen against Canadians in China," Joly said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she was unable to discuss details of the case due to privacy requests from the families.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing suggested on Thursday the Canadians had been convicted over narcotics offences, saying "... combating drug crimes is the common responsibility of all countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is a country under the rule of law," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing, she said, "treats defendants of different nationalities equally without discrimination" and "handles cases fairly in strict accordance with the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  China "protects the legitimate rights of the parties concerned as well as the consular rights of the Canadian side, in accordance with the law," Mao added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also defended the executions in a statement sent to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Drug-related crime is a severe crime recognised worldwide as extremely harmful to the society," the embassy statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China always imposes severe penalties on drug-related crimes and maintains a 'zero tolerance' attitude towards the drug problem." (AFP)

    Malaysia gives green light for new MH370 search

<img alt="Relatives of passengers on board the missing MH370 leave after taking part in a demonstration outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796601_1_20250320142559.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia’s government has given final approval for a Texas-based marine robotics company to renew the search for Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean more than a decade ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cabinet ministers agreed to terms and conditions for a “no-find, no-fee” contract with Texas-based Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation at a new 15,000-square-kilometre site in the ocean, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said. Ocean Infinity will be paid US$70 million only if it discovers the wreckage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 plane vanished from radar shortly after taking off on March 8, 2014, carrying 239 people, mostly Chinese nationals, on a flight from Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to Beijing. Satellite data showed the plane turned from its flight path and headed south to the far-southern Indian Ocean, where it is believed to have crashed .
  <br>
  <br>
  An expensive multinational search failed to turn up any clues to its location, although debris washed ashore on the east African coast and Indian Ocean islands. A private search in 2018 by Ocean Infinity also found nothing .
  <br>
  <br>
  The final approval for a new search came three months after Malaysia gave the nod in principle to plans for a fresh search.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity chief executive Oliver Punkett reportedly said this year the company had improved its technology since 2018. He has said the firm is working with many experts to analyse data and had narrowed the search area to the most likely site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said his ministry will ink a contract with Ocean Infinity soon. The firm has reportedly sent a search vessel to the site and indicated that January-April is the best period for the search.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the passengers of flight MH370,” he said. (AP)

    Temporary e-permit to assist HKers on the mainland

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers who are travelling and living in mainland China can now apply for a temporary digital permit to travel by air and train within mainland cities if they lose, damage, or forget their permit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the policy announced by the National Immigration Administration (NIA) on Thursday, the temporary digital mainland travel permit will be valid for seven days after application.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents can apply for the temporary permit via the NIA’s 12367 mobile app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Under the new policy, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan residents who lose, damage, or forget to carry their travel permits can apply for a temporary electronic permit valid for seven days, allowing them to board flights and trains within mainland cities.” the NIA said in a statement via Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA has also launched a verification service linking travel and residence permits. People can also access this service via the 12367 app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The linkage proof between the permits is for those who are trying to access finance or internet services on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NIA said they will continue to improve relevant measures to provide "accurate and equally convenient" services for SAR residents.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kingsley Wong welcomed the NIA announcement, but pointed out the arrangement only allows travellers to use two modes of transport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope temporary electronic permits can be used for immigration in the future," he told reporters at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Hong Kong residents lose their permit on the mainland, I hope they can also apply for a temporary electronic permit, allowing them to return to the city, instead of wasting their time waiting at border control points."
  <br>
  <br>
  And Hong Kong's delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee Starry Lee said the arrangement helps facilitate travel between mainland cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she hopes central authorities could consider permanent electronic permits for Hong Kong residents in the long run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will make it more convenient for people with travel permits who reside and live on the mainland," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The numbers of a mainland travel permit and a mainland identity card are different, and sometimes it may be inconvenient and time costly to deal with different situations."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chile said on Wednesday it was reviewing an agreement for the construction of a Chinese astronomical observatory on its soil, a project that has drawn criticism from Washington as it jostles with Beijing for influence in Latin America.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under an agreement signed by President Xi Jinping in 2016 with Chile's Catholic University of the North (UCN), the Ventarrones Astronomical Park was to be built in Chile's Atacama desert - home to the world's darkest skies and numerous other observatories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The project is under review, it is not cancelled," the foreign ministry in Santiago said in a statement, without providing reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said its legal department was studying the agreement and had contacted the UCN and the Chinese embassy for more information.
  <br>
  <br>
  UCN said it had made the requested data available. The embassy said the observatory was "an open and transparent international initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of Latin American countries have joined Xi's trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure program, and China has surpassed the United States as the biggest trading partner of Brazil, Peru, Chile and several other countries. (AFP)

<img alt="Very little of the doomed Malaysian Airlines plane has ever been found. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796487_1_20250319224244.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Malaysia has agreed to the terms and conditions of an agreement with exploration firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search for the wreckage of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, its transport minister said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flight MH370, a Boeing 777, was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in 2014 in one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision will enable commencement of seabed search operations in a new location estimated to cover 15,000 sq km (5,790 sq miles) in the southern Indian Ocean, based on a "no find, no fee" principle, minister Loke Siew Fook said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Infinity will receive US$70 million if the wreckage is successfully located, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government is committed to continuing the search operation and providing closure for the families of the MH370 passengers," Loke said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Malaysian government in December said it had agreed in principle with Ocean Infinity's proposal to resume the hunt for MH370. The firm had conducted the last search for the plane that ended in 2018 but failed on two attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those followed an underwater search by Malaysia, Australia and China in a 120,000 sq km (46,332 sq mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the data of automatic connections between an Inmarsat satellite and the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ship that will look for the missing plane was deployed to its Indian Ocean search zone late last month, ship tracking data showed, even though a deal had yet to be signed with the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear how long the search contract with Ocean Infinity would be. Loke had previously said it would cover an 18-month period. (Reuters)

 A stable, healthy and sustainable China-US economic and trade relationship is in the fundamental interest of both countries, and also benefits global companies, Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen told PepsiCo Chairman Ramon Laguarta in their meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang said bilateral economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature during their talks on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Commerce Ministry, the two exchanged views on topics such as China-US economic and trade ties, as well as PepsiCo's operations in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said a series of policy measures introduced by Beijing to expand domestic demand and promote consumption will provide more opportunities for foreign firms investing in China, including PepsiCo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laguarta, for his part, said his company is committed to playing a constructive role in advancing healthy and stable China-US ties. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 China on Tuesday jailed the former boss of state-owned banking giant Everbright Group for bribery, state media said, the latest official to fall foul of President Xi Jinping's decade-long corruption crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced the investigation into Li Xiaopeng, the company's former Communist Party secretary and chairman, two years ago and brought him to trial in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV reported that a court in northeastern Heilongjiang found Li guilty of accepting bribes worth over 60 million yuan between 1994 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined six million yuan, CCTV said, adding that he received a lighter punishment for confessing his crimes and cooperating with authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The property and interest obtained through his bribes have been recovered... and turned over to the state treasury," CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, former Everbright chairman Tang Shuangning was jailed for 12 years for embezzlement and bribery. (AFP)

    Kiribati eyes deep-sea mining deal with China

<img alt="View of Kiribati's Parliament House. Kiribati opened discussions with China after a deal with Canada's The Metals Company fell through.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pacific nation Kiribati says it is exploring a deep-sea mining partnership with China, dangling access to a vast patch of Pacific Ocean harbouring coveted metals and minerals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati opened discussions with Chinese ambassador Zhou Limin after a longstanding agreement with leading deep-sea mining outfit The Metals Company fell through.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talk provides an exciting opportunity to explore potential collaboration for the sustainable exploration of the deep-ocean resources in Kiribati," the government said on Monday evening in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pacific nations Kiribati, Cook Islands and Nauru sit at the forefront of a highly contentious push to mine the depths of the ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiribati holds rights for deep-sea mining exploration across a 75,000-square-kilometre swathe of the Pacific Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  Through state-backed subsidiary Marawa Research, Kiribati had been working with Canada-based The Metals Company to develop the area's mineral deposits.
  <br>
  <br>
  That agreement was terminated "mutually" at the end of 2024, The Metals Company told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Metals Company said Kiribati's mining rights were "less commercially favourable than our other projects".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm is racing to win regulatory approval that would make it one of the first companies to mine international waters on an industrial scale.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has partnerships with Kiribati's Pacific neighbours Nauru and Tonga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the International Seabed Authority are currently meeting in Jamaica to thrash out the rules for deep-sea extraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Cook Islands struck a five-year agreement in February to cooperate in exploring the Pacific nation's seabed mineral riches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal did not include any exploration or mining licence. (AFP)

    China retail sales up four percent

<img alt="Total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan, according to official figures. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796017_1_20250317110913.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in China accelerated slightly in the first two months of the year, government data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) offered some positive signs, showing retail sales – a key measure of consumer sentiment – increased four percent year-on-year during January and February combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS said total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan for the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales climbed by 3.7 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, in the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, the statement warned "domestic effective demand is weak, [and] some enterprises face difficulties in production and operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production in January and February increased 5.9 percent year-on-year, data showed, slowing from the 6.2 percent growth in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics authorities combine many economic indicators for the first two months of the year to account for potential distortions caused by the annual Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the surveyed urban unemployment rate – China's main metric for measuring unemployment – in February ticked up to 5.4 percent, the NBS said, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing announced earlier this month that it is targeting GDP growth of five percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with an intensified trade war under US President Donald Trump, the nation’s officials are looking to boost domestic consumption to reduce reliance on exports.  (AFP/Xinhua)

    'Action plan to stabilise stock, property markets'

<img alt="Central authorities have said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796002_1_20250317095840.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland officials on Monday said a special action plan to boost consumption,will, for the first time, put an emphasis on the need to stabilise both the stock and property markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Xinhua News Agency said that the action plan – organised into eight sections – aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions and to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The plan puts an emphasis on stabilising the stock and property markets, and proposes corresponding measures in a bid to make people feel more confident about consuming, with more stable expectations,” a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, Li Chunlin, told reporters at a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said officials have sought to strengthen demand-side policies to stimulate consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, the plan proposes to promote the reasonable growth of wages. This includes supporting enterprises to stabilise employment, and supporting workers to improve their skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We want to] scientifically and reasonably raise the minimum wage, so that the minimum wage standard can be adjusted on time and in a steady manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said, adding there are proposals to linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pointed out that the central government has doubled to 300 billion yuan the "ultra-long bonds" earmarked for subsidising the public's replacement of goods such as mobile electronic devices, electric cars and electronic home appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's plan also includes proposals to formulate a childcare subsidy scheme, implement paid annual leave for workers, boost healthcare protection for the elderly, along with other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, official data showed on Monday that new home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February. On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a five percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the central government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. China will also introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth.

    CK Hutchison ports deal questioned again

<img alt="View of Port of Balboa, managed by CK Hutchison Holdings at the entrance of the Panama Canal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795930_1_20250316152201.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the nation’s top legislature, Starry Lee, on Saturday called on the government to continue to coordinate with other major cities around the world to further strengthen the SAR's position across fields.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, Lee said Hong Kong should make use of its unique system and further strengthen international cooperation, citing it as one of the key takeaways from this year’s “Two Sessions” meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee suggested the government to invite various sectors to deliberate over how to boost international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Apart from economic ties with different cities, we have to think about, for example, other areas politically, or make use of culture, sport, education, technology, all these other areas we can further develop various ties with different cities around the world,” Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the radio programme, Lee said Hong Kong should expand its network with the Global South and Asean countries, aside from just looking at traditional markets in Europe and North America.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist has said that the new law proposed by Beijing to protect and enhance the country's private sector could help address "grey areas" facing private business, but cautioned that it should be gradually rolled out to avoid stifling opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the nation’s top legislators tabled the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill was first introduced to the public via a consultation last October, subsequently reviewed twice by national lawmakers since last December, and was signalled by the country's top legislature - the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee - to be hammered out in parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the bill was not passed at the annual session of the NPC, as lawmakers redrafted the bill to add more detailed measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts expect more tweaks to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since President Xi Jinping met some leading tech entrepreneurs last month, it has become a pretty clear signal that the government is very keen on promoting the private sector," Dan Wang, a director at the Eurasia Group's China team, told RTHK's Trending China programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the new bill is necessary, but cautioned that it should be rolled out gradually.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, there were too many grey areas, including violations of intellectual property rights and people taking advantage of a symmetry information, so the government wants to address that. But precisely because regulations were added very fast, it stifled opportunities that could have existed for private entities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang, who's a seasoned economist, noted that while measures from the new law, such as prohibiting local governments to exclude private firms when launching government tenders, could give a boost for small and medium-sized private enterprises, authorities must come up with new ways to provide financial assistance for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How they can provide affordable and accessible financing is a problem. And how those private businesses can compete with their SOE (state-owned enterprise) competitors in the market, that's also a difficult issue," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another distinctive measure that was proposed by Premier Li Qiang in his report to the NPC aimed to crackdown on the so-called "996" work culture and "neijuan" practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "996" work culture refers to the practice by some firms to illegally make employees work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, while "neijuan" refers to a self-defeating cycle of competition where firms feel forced to compete with one another excessively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the intention and necessity of the policy, but has questions on how it can be implemented practically.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Actually, China was in this vicious circle that everybody was racing, competing with each other to see who can come up with the longest working hours and who can be more competitive within the company. But it's quite damaging to the morale of the whole labour force," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a young, fresh graduate, they don't really have negotiating power in the labour market. They probably prefer to hold on to a job rather than negotiating the work life balance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that fresh policies from Beijing during the "Two Sessions" showed a more "pro-labour" approach as part efforts to stablise the country's private sector and job market.

    CK Hutchison shares down after port deal criticism

<img alt="CK Hutchison earlier agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by BlackRock. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795749_1_20250314172048.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    China hosts trilateral nuclear talks with Iran, Russia

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged an end to "illegal" sanctions on Iran as it hosted diplomats from that country and Russia on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran's nuclear programme.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi held their meeting in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A readout of the talks by CCTV said the three diplomats "exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ma expressed China's support for "political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect" after the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions," Ma told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force."
  <br>
  <br>
  In a joint statement, the three countries reaffirmed that political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue remains the only viable and practical option for the Iranian nuclear issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which had imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump's first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump recently sent a letter to Tehran urging nuclear talks, warning of possible military action if it refuses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded that he would not negotiate with the US while being "threatened", and Iran would not bow to US "orders" to talk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iran has long denied that it is working on developing a nuclear weapon. But the International Atomic Energy Agency warned last month that Tehran was "dramatically" accelerating enrichment of uranium to near the roughly 90 percent weapons-grade level. (AFP/Reuters)

    Japanese duo pay for Great Wall buttocks 'prank'

<img alt="The two Japanese were caught soon after their stunt at the Great Wall. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795690_1_20250314111711.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Japanese tourists in their 20s were detained for two weeks in China then deported for taking photos showing exposed buttocks at the Great Wall, local media reported.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident at the World Heritage site near Beijing concerned a man who showed his bottom and a woman who took photos, NTV and other Japanese media outlets reported on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's foreign ministry said on Friday that "the embassy of Japan in China confirmed on January 3 that two Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities at the Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  They "were subsequently released and returned to Japan during January", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese embassy did not reply to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists were detained on the spot by security guards and held for around two weeks, the reports said, citing sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exposing the lower half of the body in a public place is against the law in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tourists reportedly told the embassy they did it as a prank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports sparked outrage in China, where memories of atrocities committed during Japan's occupation of the country in the 1930s and 40s still evoke strong feelings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hashtag translating to "Japanese man and woman detained for indecent behaviour at the Great Wall" had been viewed more than 60 million times on Weibo by Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many top-liked comments blasted the tourists for the act, with some using hateful language toward Japanese people.
  <br>
  <br>
  One comment by actor Chen Yitian, who has over seven million followers on the platform, condemned them for doing "shameful things on my Great Wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Others suggested China ban all Japanese visitors. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China called on Thursday for a "diplomatic" resolution to the Iran nuclear issue as it prepared to host diplomats from Tehran and Moscow for talks in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "In the current situation, we believe that all parties should maintain calm and restraint to avoid escalating the Iran nuclear situation, or even walking towards confrontation and conflict," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will be attended by Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States withdrew from a landmark deal that had imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief during President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the 2015 deal for a year after Washington's withdrawal but then began rolling back its commitments. Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said the upcoming talks would aim to "strengthen communication and coordination, to resume dialogue and negotiation at an early time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China sincerely hopes that all parties can work together, continuously increase mutual trust and dispel misgivings, and turn the momentum of restarting dialogue and negotiation into reality at an early date," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Beijing has called for "dialogue" with Washington to resolve spiralling trade tensions that have seen the world's two largest economies impose a number of tariffs on each other's imports in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States and China will work together... to return to the correct track of resolving issues through dialogue and consultation," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian at a news conference. (AFP)

 Macau health authorities on Thursday said that a two-year-old girl from the SAR who was seriously injured in a shopping mall blast in Taichung has died.

  The suspected gas explosion on February 13 hit the food court of the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, killing four on the spot and injuring about 30 others.

  The Macau government announcement, made in the early hours of Thursday, noted that the girl had died on March 7, with authorities expressing deep sorrow over her passing and extending condolences to her family.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

 China will host Russia and Iran for trilateral talks on Tehran's nuclear programme on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The three parties will exchange views on the Iranian nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest," a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu will chair the meeting in Beijing, which will be attended by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov Sergey Alexeevich and Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting will follow a closed-door gathering of the United Nations Security Council in New York the same day regarding Iran's expansion of its stocks of uranium that are close to weapons-grade.
  <br>
  <br>
  During US President Donald Trump's first term, which ended in 2021, Washington withdrew from the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal that had imposed curbs on the country's nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tehran adhered to the agreement for a year after Washington's withdrawal, but then began rolling back its commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to revive the pact have since faltered. (Agencies)

    'Growth target signals China's intent to beat tariffs'

<img alt="China unveiled ambitious growth targets and plans for high-tech development at the Two Sessions. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795377_1_20250312104001.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist at a leading investment bank on Wednesday said the main takeaways from the recently concluded Two Sessions was that China was prepared to handle the new round of US tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the annual meeting of the National People's Congress (NPC), Premier Li Qiang set a five percent growth target and vowed more support for private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told Carol Musgrave that the NPC's emphasis on artificial intelligence development was also significant.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has really rebuffed the US pressure, Trump's pressure, on China by maintaining the [growth] target by saying 'tariffs won't hurt me', and also by announcing amazing plans in terms of supporting AI development," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  García-Herrero acknowledged that tariffs from the US and other countries would create headwinds for China and could dampen the demand for Chinese exports, but added that Beijing had other policies in its toolbox to meet its economic targets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What Premier Li Qiang announced to make this [growth] target credible was to do more stimulus, whether its fiscal, with a larger fiscal deficit from three percent to four percent, but also cutting interest rates."

    'China changing course of economic development'

<img alt="Lau Siu-kai says Hong Kong should help Beijing build connections beyond Western countries. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795279_1_20250311172739.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior member of a leading national think tank on Tuesday said the annual "Two Sessions" which just wrapped up in Beijing showed China's emphasis on the economy and innovation amid Sino-US tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lau Siu-kai, a consultant to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, said Beijing has shifted its focus from export and infrastructure to consumption and innovation technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the emphasis is still on the economy, particularly at a time when the world economy is in a poor state and that China is under containment by the United States. That's why China is very desperate to change the course of economic development," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his annual work report, Premier Li Qiang called on Hong Kong to "deepen international exchanges and cooperation" while safeguarding the constitutional order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau highlighted the SAR's role in helping Beijing develop connections beyond Western countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both China and Hong Kong today, in order to shake off the constraints imposed on us by the United States and its Western allies, we have to explore new opportunities for development from the non-Western world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why China wants Hong Kong as an international city with widespread international linkages to help both Hong Kong itself and China to develop more connections with other places apart from the Western world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead to the 15th Five-Year Plan that begins next year, Lau stressed the need for the city to align its development plan with the nation's strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the weeklong "Two Sessions", the National People's Congress Standing Committee released a work report stating that Beijing will formulate the private economy promotion law to strengthen legal protection and policy support for private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said he believes Beijing is stepping up support for and giving a bigger role to private companies, to put them on an equal footing with state enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Most importantly, Beijing will allow the private enterprises to have a much larger market within China, and to help them explore the opportunities abroad," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The third annual session of the 14th National People’s Congress (NPC) concluded in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping and other leaders attended the closing at the Great Hall of the People.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was one notable absence: Zhao Leji, the NPC Standing Committee chairman, suffered a respiratory infection.
  <br>
  <br>
  His deputy, vice-chairman Li Hongzhong, took his place and presided over the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his closing speech, Li declared the week-long session a success.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meeting fully demonstrated democracy, and all work was conducted in strict accordance with the law. We identified our goals and tasks and also conveyed confidence and strength. It is a meeting about delivering real results through solid work, as well as forging unity,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Let us rally around the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, forge ahead with perseverance and diligence, and further contribute to the country’s modernisation with Chinese characteristics.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 2,900 NPC delegates in attendance passed seven draft resolutions, including one endorsing the annual government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's sole delegate to the top legislature, Starry Lee, says it's a "responsible decision" for Zhao to skip the closing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR deputy revealed the top official was also absent from two NPC presidium meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all understand that sickness is really difficult to control ... We noticed that he (Zhao) had been absent for two times already," she said.

    Beijing hopes for 'just solution' to Ukraine war

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Tuesday it hoped a "just and lasting solution" can be found to the three-year war between Ukraine and Russia, ahead of talks that will involve Ukrainian and US officials in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China supports all efforts that contribute to a peaceful resolution of the crisis," said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning when asked about the talks at a regular news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect and hope that parties can reach a just and lasting solution that is acceptable to all sides," said Mao.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is also willing to continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for a political resolution of the crisis," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House visit last month when US President Donald Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky has met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ahead of the talks between Ukrainian and US officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the meeting in Jeddah, the crown prince underscored the kingdom's support for international efforts to resolve Ukraine's crisis and achieving peace, the Saudi state news agency SPA reported early on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, once Ukraine's main ally, has upended its policy on the conflict in its stated pursuit of a rapid end to the fighting, engaging directly with Moscow while stopping military assistance and intelligence sharing for Ukraine.
