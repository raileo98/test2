<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

    China's population falls for third year in a row

<img alt="The total number of births was 9.54 million in 2024, slightly lower than the number of deaths which stood at 10.93 million. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787977_1_20250117125825.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the number of deaths outpacing a slight increase in births.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics said the total number of people in China dropped by 1.39 million to 1.408 billion in 2024, compared to 1.409 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of births was 9.54 million versus 9.02 million in 2023, the bureau said. The birth rate rose to 6.77 births per 1,000 people in 2024 versus 6.39 per 1,000 people in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of deaths was 10.93 million in 2024, down from 11.1 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet.
  <br>
  <br>
  China three years ago joined countries with falling populations, including Japan and most of Eastern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland authorities unveiled a series of measures in 2024 to boost the country’s birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December they urged colleges and universities to integrate marriage and "love education" into their curriculums to emphasise positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the State Council rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spreading respect for childbearing and marriage "at the right age".
  <br>
  <br>
  Data released on Friday showed the number of people aged 60 and over reached 310.31 million -- just a few percentage points short of a quarter of the country and an increase from the nearly 297 million recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, officials said they would gradually raise the statutory retirement age from 60, which was among the lowest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Gietel-Basten, an expert in population policy from the University of Science and Technology, said high living costs and social changes contributed to low fertility rates in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've had the aftermath of Covid and the kind of slowdown of the economy. We have relatively high unemployment rates among young people and the challenges of getting a job, but also getting a house, getting a family started,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rather than focusing only on boosting birth rates, Gietel-Basten said mainland officials should think of ways to improve quality of life and work-life balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People would like to have children, but there's just these institutional barriers in place which are preventing people from having the number of children that they would like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we have to focus on understanding those barriers, breaking them down, not just to increase the fertility rate for its own sake, but to actually make people's lives happier.” (Additional reporting from agencies)

    China economy expands 5 percent in 2024

<img alt="China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Friday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787956_1_20250117101930.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the nation's growth for 2024, NBS commissioner Kang Yi touched on the challenges at home and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2024 witnessed a complex international environment... and there was a lack of efficient demand, and pains in the shift of growth drivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all that, the Chinese economy withstood pressures, overcame difficulties, making a new contribution to global growth," Kang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), said it was in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the troubled property sector remains a concern, despite slight improvements in new domestic home prices, with those in first-tier cities edging up 0.2 percent last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still too early to conclude if there is a stablisation in the property market. Of course the property prices in both the first-hand and secondary markets seemed to have improved, but they are still contracting, still in the negative region on a monthly basis," he said, adding that transaction volumes still dropped around 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really need to see an overall improvement of the property prices, a sustainable improvement, because the wealth effect determines whether households are willing to spend, and also affects the assessment of the economic prospects in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities have begun preparations to resume group tours to Taiwan by residents of Shanghai and Fujian province in the near future, the culture and tourism ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to resume such tours since the end of Covid-19, and have blamed each other for the lack of progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The culture and tourism ministry said in a short statement that the resumption of group tours from Shanghai, as well as from Fujian province, which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait from the island, would happen soon. However, it did not give a date for the resumption of travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was being done in order to further promote the normalisation of people-to-people exchanges and "enhance the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait," the ministry said. (Reuters)

    Apple loses top spot in China smartphone sales

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

    China 'firmly opposes' new US tech curbs on smart cars

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<img alt="Justin Lin says the potential US tariff hikes under Trump will hurt the global economy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787334_2_20250113175438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Saturday met with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who is in Beijing for the 11th China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue.
 <br>
  <br>
  China and the UK are both major economies and financial heavyweights in the world, Han said, pointing out that strengthening economic and financial cooperation in the spirit of strategic partnership is of great significance to promoting economic growth, improving people's lives and encouraging green development in these two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also inject confidence and impetus into the development of the world economy, Han added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is willing to continue to expand openness and exchanges with the UK, enhance mutual understanding and trust, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation to bring more benefits to the two countries and the world, said Han.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves, meanwhile, said the resumption of this dialogue after nearly six years is of great significance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British side attaches importance to developing relations with China and is willing to strengthen candid dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation with China to promote the economic development of each country, she added. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Treasury chief is travelling to China this weekend to discuss economic and financial cooperation between the countries, as the UK's Labour government seeks to reset ties with Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury on Friday said that Rachel Reeves would travel to Beijing and Shanghai and would meet with her counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' trip is expected to revive the China-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue — annual bilateral talks that have been suspended since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and the UK Financial Conduct Authority's chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, are also in the delegation, according to the Treasury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from some of Britain’s biggest financial services firms will join the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials did not provide details, but media reports have said senior executives from HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered were included.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves' visit comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy travelled to China in October and Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meetings form part of a bid by Starmer, who was elected as leader in July, to strengthen political and economic ties with China, the UK's fifth-largest trading partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said Starmer wanted a “pragmatic” approach to working with Beijing on global stability, climate change and the transition to clean energy. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles jumped more than 40 percent in China last year, as demand for new energy models continues to surge and the sector remains entrenched in a gruelling price war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle market has witnessed explosive growth in recent years, driven in part by subsidies from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the world's largest automotive market has also seen fierce competition among domestic car manufacturers as a consumption slowdown fuels a price war that is weighing on profitability
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, almost 11 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) were sold, a year-on-year increase of 40.7 percent, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NEVs accounted for nearly half - 47.6 percent - of all retail sales last year, the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, such vehicles accounted for just 22.6 percent of sales in the European market in November, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In China, NEV sales surpassed 1.3 million units in December, CPCA data showed, up 37.5 percent year-on-year and representing the fifth consecutive month of sales of more than one million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond just NEVs, the total number of vehicles sold last year in the Chinese market swelled 5.5 percent, reaching nearly 22.9 million units, the CPCA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For EV companies, the price war is likely to carry on in the new year, CPCA secretary general Cui Dongshu said during a Thursday press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 car models saw price cuts last year, compared to 148 in 2023, Cui added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged as a clear leader in the Chinese market. The Shenzhen-based firm sold more than four million vehicles globally in 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing’s top official on Hong Kong affairs on Thursday stressed that safeguarding national security goes hand in hand with development as he laid out Beijing’s expectations for Hong Kong and Macau to make pragmatic contributions to the overall development of the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Xia Baolong was speaking in at a seminar in Beijing on the spirit of a key speech by President Xi Jinping in Macau last month to mark 25 years since its return to the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said both SARs need to be unwavering both in maintaining security and in focusing on development, and that Hong Kong and Macau need to fully demonstrate the benefits of the One country, two systems principle as they connect the country with the world, and “polish” their brands internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director noted that the President had spoken about how the values of peace, inclusiveness and openness are all embodied in One country, two systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted President Xi’s directive for the SARs to adopt the necessary changes to make greater contributions to the Greater Bay Area, adding that the president's expectations and hopes for Macau also apply to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also stressed the need for unity under the banner of patriotism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In implementing the One Country, Two Systems principle, not only do [the two SARs] need to promote the core value of patriotism and loving Hong Kong and Macau, they also need to seek common ground and allow for differences," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a response, Chief Executive John Lee said the SAR government would better integrate with the nation with a highly efficient market, and be steadfast in leading and promoting socio-economic development here.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a social media post, he added that his administration would maintain peace, stability and unity within society, while acting as a bridge between the nation and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE was among many who watched in the seminar via video-link in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event was organised by the think tank Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its vice president, Tam Yiu-chung, added that Xia had expressed hopes that the business sector would continue to be proactive in taking part in the development of both the country and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He thinks businesses have always been very supportive in the country's development. A high ratio of investments on the mainland came from Hong Kong companies," Tam said in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So Director Xia expressed hope that going forward, Hong Kong's business sector continues to be proactive."
  <br>
  <br>
  A consultant for the think tank, Lau Siu-kai, quoted Xia as saying that Hong Kong needs to change its mindset and be more innovative on economic development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The search-and-rescue effort has entered its final stage after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Dingri County in the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China on Tuesday, the regional government said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The focus of work has shifted to the resettlement of quake-affected residents and post-disaster reconstruction, said Hong Li, head of the regional emergency management department at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will spare no effort in searching for those who are still unaccounted for and treating the injured, Hong added.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 10,000 rescuers have been dispatched for the search-and-rescue work, and have found and rescued 407 people, said Wang Fanghong, mayor of Xigaze, which administers Dingri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always taken safeguarding people's lives as the top priority, and have organised disaster prevention works in a timely manner, properly relocating those affected while minimising casualties," Wang told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hundreds of aftershocks have been reported after Tuesday's quake that killed at least 126 people and injured 188 others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inspecting the rescue efforts, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing again called for all-out efforts to find survivors and treat the injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also stressed the importance of ensuring those living in temporary shelters safe and warm. (Xinhua and agencies)

<img alt="Mainland authorities are expecting a record Spring Festival travel rush. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786642_1_20250108163941.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they will increase capacity during the upcoming Spring Festival travel rush, which is expected to be the busiest ever.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 40-day period, also known as "Chunyun" season, will run from January 14 to February 22, with the Year of the Snake starting on January 29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities expect the number of inter-regional trips to hit 9 billion, and rail and flight passenger trips to exceed 510 million and 90 million respectively, all record highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The scale of the Spring Festival travel rush will further increase this year. It's also the first year that Lunar New Year's Eve is a national holiday, so there will be eight days off in total during the Spring Festival," Li Chunlin, deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Passenger flows will be higher before and after the holiday, and the NDRC and other bodies have conducted early research and planning. We'll adopt comprehensive measures to try our best to meet the demands of the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  To accommodate higher passenger flows, Li said more than 140,000 railway trains will be arranged on average each day during the travel rush, up 4 percent year on year, while the daily number of flights will be about 185,000, up 8.4 percent from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also said passenger flows will be particularly high in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei regions, as well as in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of road trips, meanwhile, is projected to reach 7.2 billion, accounting for about 80 percent of the total, and daily highway traffic could also hit a record high.

 The number of dead in a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China has risen to at least 126.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tremor also left 188 others injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have raised the earthquake emergency response to the highest level, the region's emergency command centre announced on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The earthquake struck at 9.05am, and the epicentre was in Tsogo Township of Dingri County.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,000 houses were damaged in the strongest tremor to hit Dingri in five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many people were trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the remote region.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out rescue efforts to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing led a team to the quake site, and thousands of rescuers and medical workers have been sent to the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  People in northeastern Nepal also felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it attaches "great importance" to remarks by US President-elect Donald Trump on developing bilateral ties.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of Sino-US economic and trade relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said in a media briefing on Tuesday, citing mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday said he and President Xi Jinping have been speaking through representatives, and that he believes the two leaders will get along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've already been talking. We've been talking through their representatives," Trump said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think we will probably get very well, I predict," he said. "But you know, it's got to be a two-way street."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo did not confirm that any exchanges had been made through the leaders' aides, but said the two countries have maintained communications through various means.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Vice Premier He Lifeng held talks via video link with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, with both sides agreeing to maintain communication, manage differences and continue stabilisation of economic relations during the political transition period in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the video call was candid, in-depth and constructive, and both nations agreed on the importance of maintaining communication.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua added that the Chinese side expressed concern over US economic and trade restrictions on China, in particular clarifying Beijing's position concerning the recent trade investigation initiated by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yellen, meanwhile, raised concerns about "malicious cyber activity" by Chinese state-sponsored actors, according to a statement by the US Treasury Department. (Agencies)

    'Putting Tencent, CATL on US list is suppression'

<img alt="The US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery maker CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786435_1_20250107115416.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of "unjustified suppression" after the US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery manufacturer CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is always firmly opposed to the US side's generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the curbing of China's high-quality development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrong practices," Guo said, adding China would "take the necessary measures to resolutely protect the rights of Chinese companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless, drone maker Autel Robotics, and China's largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, according to a document published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two entities owned by Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation were also listed, CNOOC China Ltd and CNOOC International Trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under US law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to US entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could also add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent fell as much as seven percent in early trade on Tuesday, while the US-traded shares of the company, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell eight percent in over-the-counter trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker whose Shenzhen-listed shares dropped more than five percent, also called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military-related activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error." Quectel's shares fell nearly seven percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cosco's HK-listed shares dropped more than four percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has ordered all out rescue efforts after at least 95 people were killed and another 130 injured when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the Tibet Autonomous Region in western China on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The epicentre was about 75 kilometres northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border with Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged efforts to prevent secondary disasters, properly resettle affected residents, and handle the aftermath work effectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is essential to strengthen earthquake monitoring and early warning, promptly allocate emergency rescue supplies, expedite the repair of damaged infrastructure, ensure the basic needs of residents are met, and guarantee a safe and warm winter for all," Xi said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world’s tallest peaks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average altitude in the area around the epicentre is about 4,200 metres, the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post.
  <br>
  <br>
  State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within five kilometres of the epicentre, which was 380 kilometres from Lhasa, the provincial capital, and about 23 kilometres from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, also known as Xigaze in Chinese.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 230 kilometres away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicentre.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also reports of tremors in the northern Indian state of Bihar, which borders Nepal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the quake damaged or destroyed buildings in the autonomous region.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the China Earthquake Networks Centre, the quake occurred at 9.05am local time in Xigaze, at a depth of 10 kilometres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It revised the strength of the tremor from its earlier reading of 6.9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Geological Survey, meanwhile, reported the tremor as magnitude 7.1.
  <br>
  <br>
  By 10am, multiple aftershocks had been recorded, with the largest one measuring 4.4 in magnitude, according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos went viral on Chinese social media platforms, showing crumbled houses amid the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council Earthquake Relief Headquarters Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management have launched a level 3 emergency response to the quake, while the local government dispatched over 1,500 people to conduct search and rescue work in the affected areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  South-western parts of China, Nepal and northern India are frequently hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2008, a huge quake in Sichuan province killed almost 70,000 people, while a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in 2015 leaving about 9,000 people dead in Nepal's worst ever earthquake. (Reporting by Xinhua, Reuters and Associated Press)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's services activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven months in December, buoyed by accelerated growth in domestic demand, although overseas orders declined, according to a private sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global Services purchasing managers' index (PMI), which provides an independent snapshot of operating conditions in industries as such retail and tourism, rose to 52.2 in December from 51.5 the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  That growth pace was the fastest since May 2024, surpassing the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The readings also broadly align with the country's official PMI data released last week, which saw non-manufacturing activity considerably recover to 52.2 in December, after a neutral reading of 50.0 in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the survey showed that new business sub-index rose to 52.7 in December from 51.8 in November. However, inflows from abroad fell for the first time since August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  A business confidence reading remained positive but dipped to the second-lowest since March 2020, with companies worried by potential international trade disruption after Donald Trump returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports could also face tariff risks under a second Trump administration. Authorities have recently introduced measures to revitalise growth. (Reuters)

 A fire at a food market on Saturday in northern China killed at least eight people and injured 15 others, state media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fire at the Liguang market in the city of Zhangjiakou broke out at 08:40 am on Saturday and was mostly extinguished by 12:00 pm (0400 GMT), Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a government official in Qiaoxi District where the market is located.

    Discounts for iPhones in China as competition heats up

<img alt="The flagship iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785914_1_20250102192311.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan (US$68.5) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-day promotion, running from January 4 to 7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3 percent during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42 percent, according to research firm IDC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has added 28 US entities to its export control list to "safeguard national security and interests", the Commerce Ministry said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The companies on the list include General Dynamics, Boeing Defence, Space & Security, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Missiles & Defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  China is also banning the export of dual-use items to these companies starting on Thursday, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the ministry said on Thursday it had added 10 US companies to its "Unreliable Entity List" for their involvement in arms sales to Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective from Thursday, the blacklisted companies, which include various units of Lockheed and General Dynamics, will be banned from exporting to and importing from China or making new investments in the country, according to the ministry. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department has announced that authorities are now handling up to 500 applications each working day from car owners who want to drive to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, up from 400 previously.
 <br>
  <br>
  The department said the move will allow it to better cope with the number of applications being received under the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eligibility, procedures and balloting of applications of the scheme remain unchanged," a spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong will continue to monitor the operation of Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and maintain close liaison with relevant departments to review and enhance the arrangements of the scheme in a timely manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scheme began in June 2023 and more than 60,000 applications had been submitted by the middle of last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Transport and Logistics Mable Chan said on Thursday that imported talent can help with maintenance of the C919 aircraft in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern is now using the domestically made jet on flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a radio programme, Chan was asked whether Hong Kong has a sufficient number of engineers able to carry out maintenance work on the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Civil Aviation Department has been participating in the certification work of the C919 on the mainland since 2012, and the department has also deployed workers to the mainland to join related training courses," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we need more people to offer short-term support, we can also make use of existing schemes to import talents, as well as work visas to cater for the need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the transport chief also said flight movements at the airport returned to pre-pandemic levels over Christmas, with a daily peak of about 1,150.
  <br>
  <br>
  The average daily number of passengers exceeded 180,000 during the holiday, with a peak of 190,000 on December 21, Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau said its casino revenues rose by almost a quarter in 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the SAR's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau showed gaming revenue last year coming in at 227 billion patacas, 23.9 percent higher than in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  That topped the government's estimate of 216 billion patacas, but trailed the 292.5 billion logged prior to the pandemic in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau, the world's biggest gambling hub, is now looking to diversify its economy through new industries and increased integration with the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its economy has been heavily reliant on casinos, which contribute about 80 percent of tax revenues. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The inaugural flights of the domestically-produced C919 aircraft between Shanghai and Hong Kong have opened a "new chapter" for the SAR as an international aviation hub, transport and logistics chief Mable Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first flight that took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport arrived in the SAR shortly before 11am.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcoming ceremony at the Hong Kong International Airport, Chan said she feels honoured to witness the historic moment on New Year's Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is the first city beyond the other mainland cities to have this kind of commercial flight. So we are especially happy to see this flight materialise on the first day of 2025," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that through this commercial flight, we can bring this historical innovation breakthrough in the mainland's production of civil aviation aircraft to our Hong Kong citizens, as well as to the international visitors coming to Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR has what it takes to shine as an aviation engineering hub.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong International Airport has rich experience and comprehensive facilities to fully support the maintenance of domestically produced aircraft in Hong Kong and overseas," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Secondly, the Hong Kong International Aviation Academy is an important aviation talent training base in the Asia region. The academy is planning to expand training to cover C919 aircraft, which will help domestically-produced planes enter overseas markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The transport chief also said the government is looking to further develop the aircraft leasing market by rolling out various tax incentives, to help homegrown aircraft go global.

 A domestically-produced C919 aircraft has completed its first commercial flight to Hong Kong amid much fanfare.
 <br>
  <br>
  The homegrown passenger jet, operated by China Eastern airlines and carrying around 160 passengers, took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport at 8.15am on Wednesday and landed in the SAR about two and a half hours later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Passengers were treated to an exceptional travel experience, with each of them receiving a special framed boarding pass – printed with the flight number, date, as well as the letters “C919” - as a souvenir.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of those on-board the full flight was Ryan, who flew on the C919 aircraft for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m also a citizen of Hong Kong. It feels really special. Shanghai is my hometown and Hong Kong is like my second hometown. It’s really special to be able to experience the Chinese manufactured C919 on this flight,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan described the flight experience as being “impressively good.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “I am quite fortunate to get the bulkhead seat. It has plenty of leg room which is nice on a narrow-body jet. Looking back, the leg room is also big [for other seats] and the tray table is pretty nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  13-year-old Joe, a flying enthusiast, flew solo.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the control of noise is very nice. Because it’s the first aircraft of China and in some ways it’s even better than Boeing and Airbus. The seats… are really comfortable,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The meal was really good... We had this sort of Shanghai cake and another cake that had C919 letters on it and it was very delicious.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other passengers like Gin and his son Harrison, who just happened to be on this maiden flight, said they were impressed with the flight experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I thought it would be very loud but the noise wasn’t big at all. The seats were quite spacious,” six-year-old Harrison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the captain of the inaugural flight, Shang Feng, told RTHK that he's honoured and excited to take passengers to Hong Kong on board the C919.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is our ninth destination with C919. Over the last two years, C919 has been flying to major airports in mainland cities and it fully showcases its ability to adapt and operate smoothly in different locations. I believe future regular flights to Hong Kong will be smooth,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Eastern said it will be using the C919 jet for one round-trip flight between Shanghai and Hong Kong per day, with the return trip scheduled for departure at 12.55pm.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said that China's economy faced the "pressure of transformation" but could overcome this through hard work, in his annual New Year's speech broadcast to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The current economic operation faces some new situations, challenges from the uncertainty of the external environment, and pressure of transformation from old drivers of growth into new ones, but these can be overcome through hard work," he said in an address broadcast on state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the economy had rebounded and was on an upward trajectory, with its GDP expected to exceed US$17.8 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said the country had fostered new quality productive forces and had seen new business sectors, forms and models emerging.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's annual production of new energy vehicles topped 10 million for the first time in 2024, while the country made breakthroughs in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields, Xi said in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi reiterated China's commitment to promoting global governance reform and contributing to the maintenance of world peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world of both transformation and turbulence, China, as a responsible major country, is actively promoting global governance reform and deepening solidarity and cooperation among the Global South," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said "Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties, and no one can stop the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president pledged China would unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau. (Xinhua/AFP)

    China manufacturing continues expansion in December

<img alt="Chinese manufacturing activity continued to expand in December, although at a slower rate than in November. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785626_1_20241231161725.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    China expresses 'deep condolences' over Carter's death

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prototype of the CR450 bullet train that will run at 400 kilometres per hour made its debut in Beijing on Sunday, said the country's railway operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Railway said the train, which has a sleek, bullet-shaped nose and resembles an arrow when viewed from the side, is capable of running at a top speed of 450 kilometres per hour during trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s tipped to become the world’s fastest commercial train when it starts operations next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said the train can essentially cut travel time from Beijing to Shanghai from the current four hours, to just 2.5 hours.

    Gao, Zhang inspire China to opening win at United Cup

<img alt="Gao Xinyu (Left) of China shakes hand with Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil after their women's singles match at the 2025 United Cup tennis tournament in Perth, Australia. Photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785270_1_20241228094532.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in Zhuhai last month was on Friday sentenced to death.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Weiqiu was on trial at the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court on charges of endangering public safety by dangerous means.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Fan, 62, deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society", state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court found Fan had decided to vent his anger over a broken marriage, personal frustrations and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was also deprived of his political rights for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident in Zhuhai has been described as the worst attack in China in a decade. (Xinhua/AFP)

 China on Friday warned the United States it did not tolerate interference over Washington's comments this week on rewards offered by the Hong Kong government leading to the arrest of six national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes this. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and we do not tolerate interference and meddling by any external power," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The extraterritorial application of Hong Kong's national security laws is fully consistent with international law and practice."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities announced six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest. The US State Department called it "a form of transnational repression", adding some of those individuals were based in the US. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday launched its first Type 076 new-generation amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, in Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br>
  Named after Sichuan province, the independently-developed new vessel was put into the water at a launch-and-naming ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was given the hull number 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sichuan has a full-load displacement of over 40,000 tonnes and features a dual-island superstructure along with a full-length flight deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  It incorporates innovative electromagnetic catapult and arrestor technologies, enabling it to carry fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and amphibious equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new-generation amphibious assault ship of the People's Liberation Army Navy, it plays a key role in advancing the Navy's transformation and enhancing its combat capabilities in the far seas, according to Navy officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following its launch, the ship will undergo a series of planned tests, including equipment commissioning, mooring tests and sea trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Navy unveiled its inaugural 075-class amphibious assault ship, the Hainan, in Shanghai in 2019. Two more Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the Guangxi and the Anhui, have also been commissioned.  (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee on Friday said she hopes the newly restored multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents can be extended to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR saw more mainland visitors over Christmas, which benefited the retail, catering and hospitality sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that with the close monitoring of the implementation, more and more cities in the GBA in particular can have more relaxed visa application procedures so that more people from different cities in the Guangdong area can come to Hong Kong to visit and we can exchange more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earlier attended a standing committee meeting in Beijing where she said 10 bills were discussed and some, involving value-added tax, the Supervision Law and the Science and Technology Popularisation Law, were passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 14th National People's Congress will open its third annual session in the capital on March 5, and Lee described 2025 as a "critical year", saying Hong Kong should play a more active role in inviting foreign investment and attracting talent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong travellers will soon be able to fly on the homegrown C919 aircraft from Chek Lap Kok airport, with China Eastern Airlines assigning the narrow-body passenger jet to its daily route between the SAR and Shanghai from January 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The news was announced by the the Transport and Logistics Bureau on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Secretary for Transport Mable Chan thanked the Civil Aviation Administration of China for its continued strong support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move hopefully will allow more SAR residents a chance to step on the C919 and experience the remarkable achievements of the nation's aviation development. International travellers can also know more about the technological advances of China's aviation development," the post read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By assigning the C919 to a regular route between Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao airports, it reflects the importance of the SAR as a global aviation hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has already instructed the Civil Aviation Department and the Airport Authority to provide comprehensive assistance, ensure the best experience for passengers and promote the nation's aviation achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  She earlier met representatives of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMAC, and thanked the company for setting up an office in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can provide assistance on many fronts, including aircraft maintenance, personnel training, as well as leasing and sale of aircraft," Chan wrote.

 A Macau official has died after a car accident in an industrial area of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Macau's Government Information Bureau said Chief of the Office of the Secretary for Security, Cheong Ioc-ieng, died after the crash on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A clip that circulated online showed the front of a private car engulfed in flames after a collision with a bus. The car reportedly lost control on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video showed Cheong, who had been driving the car, being pulled out of the vehicle by passers-by before firefighters arrived.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters said three people were injured at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheong was reported to have been taken to hospital with no signs of breathing or heartbeat. The other two injured people were passengers on the bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Secretary for Security expressed sadness over Cheong's death and sent condolences to her family.

    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

    China vows cooperation over severed undersea cables

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has provided information and documents to a joint investigation into two severed Baltic Sea undersea cables, and has invited Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to participate in and complete the inquiry, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made the remarks at a news briefing when asked about a Financial Times report that Sweden had criticised China for refusing full access despite an open investigation, and for not allowing its public prosecutor to board the suspect ship, Yi Peng 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese bulk carrier is moving again after sitting still for more than a month in Danish waters, the Swedish Coastguard said on Saturday. China allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board the vessel for the investigation last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to cooperate with the investigation, the Yi Peng 3 has been suspended for a long period of time, and in order to safeguard the physical and mental health of the crew, the shipowner company has decided to resume its voyage after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with the parties concerned," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that China had notified all relevant countries in advance and was willing to maintain communication and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yi Peng 3 came under investigation following the breach in November of two fibre-optic cables - one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania - that raised suspicions of sabotage and concerns about the security of critical infrastructure. (Reuters)

 Shanghai authorities have partially reopened a metro line which was closed on Sunday morning after a train smashed into a fallen crane on the track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The train was badly damaged but no injuries were reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that following emergency repairs, Line 11 services heading towards Disney Resort Station resumed around half a day after the crash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency said a crane at a construction site snapped and fell onto the tracks, causing damage to rail network facilities as well as the train.

 A train was badly damaged after it crashed into a crane in Shanghai on Sunday morning.
 <br>
  <br>
  No one was injured in the accident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Footage circulating online apparently captured the dramatic moment, when the moving train – running at full speed – collided with the crane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos also showed the train suffering a substantial level of damage, with shattered glass all over the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that the crane had "intruded" into the track and damaged facilities on route 11 of the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said repairs are expected to take a considerable amount of time because of the complicated situation at the scene, adding that commuters should take other modes of transportation.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to mainland media, two cranes were lifting a steel frame just after 8am, when one of them suddenly snapped and hit the moving train.

<img alt="City University of Macau's head, Jun Liu, says Macau is now in a better position to move forward with more vision. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784361_1_20241220162653.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Macau-based academic on Friday said the SAR should think of ways to bring people to neighbouring Hengqin Island, which is partly leased to the territory, to diversify its economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a speech at the inauguration of the new Macau government, President Xi Jinping urged authorities not to deviate from the purpose of the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area offers support for Macau in diversifying its economy and developing four key industries: big health; innovation and technology; financial services; conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Hengqin] is highly developed, but it still lacks population," City University of Macau's rector Jun Liu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we really think about Hengqin as an expanded area, as a collaboration zone, we need to have people. We need to have policies to support four areas of economic diversification, we need to retain those highly qualified graduates... On the other hand, we really need to look elsewhere for great talent from around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor also said the new government under Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai is expected to take forward measures and initiatives, after the previous administration had laid the groundwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, it seems that we are [in] a better position to move forward with more vision, more hands-on strategies," Liu said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday directed Macau to diversify its economy as one of his four “hopes” for its new administration, after swearing in the SAR’s new Chief Executive, Sam Hou-fai.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president expressed confidence the SAR will open up new horizons for development and keep creating new glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland, Xi also laid out his expectations for the government to improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China’s connections with the international community, and safeguard social harmony and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president urged the gambling hub to cultivate new industries in alignment with China's national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present the overall situation in Macau is stable, but the internal and external environment is undergoing profound changes," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Efforts should be made to promote moderate economic diversification... [with a] focus on cultivating new industries with international competitiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi also highlighted the importance of Hengqin Island, which was partly leased to Macau to boost its land supply for non-gaming development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government decided to develop Hengqin with the goal of fostering Macau's development of a diversified economy and to facilitate the living and employment of Macau residents," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There can be no development of industries and projects that do not align with this positioning."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the crucial role that the One Country, Two Systems model has played in ensuring the city’s success in the past 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's splendid achievements since its return to the motherland is proof to the world that 'One Country, Two Systems' has a clear systemic advantage and strong vitality," Xi said, adding that the framework "must be adhered to over the long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that young people in the city should continue to build on the successes of One Country, Two Systems, and urged authorities to help nurture the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The SAR government and all sectors in society should care more about them and help them develop, and create a better environment and conditions for them,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope all young people will care about Macau and the country, set lofty goals, be pragmatic, and fulfil the role of builders and successors of the cause of One Country Two Systems.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Macau has been shining like a “bright pearl” and that its people have benefitted from its economic and social development over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sense of gain, happiness and security of Macau residents have strengthened significantly,” Xi said. (Additional reporting by agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called on Macau to better integrate into the country's strategic development and continue to strive for more, saying the SAR has what it takes to "fly high".
 <br>
  <br>
  Stating his three expectations on Thursday, the president urged the city to align with the motherland's developments; to gather people who safeguard One Country, Two Systems and love Macau; and to undergo reforms and innovate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Macau] must keep an eye on the overall strategies of the rejuvenation of the Chinese civilisation and changes in the world," Xi addressed a dinner reception celebrating the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should keep up with the trend of the times, further find its own positioning, plan for the future development of Macau, be more proactive in aligning with national development strategies such as the Greater Bay Area, and make greater achievements on the international stage," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president praised the outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and his administration, saying the past five years had been "extraordinary" in the city's history, navigating constant changes in the world and challenges presented by the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support of the central government and the motherland, Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and the fifth-term government have united and led all sectors of Macau to overcome difficulties, and to be pragmatic," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They] have promoted the continued improvement of the economy, with various undertakings making comprehensive progress and writing a new chapter in the successful implementation of One Country, Two Systems with Macau characteristics."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, for his part, told the crowd that his administration had implemented the principle of "patriots governing Macau", safeguarded national security, promoted moderate economic diversification, improved governance, and better integrated into the nation's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The motherland is the strongest backing for Macau's prosperity and stability. The country has always regarded Macau as its 'crown jewel', cared about the well-being of compatriots, continued to introduce a series of policies and measures beneficial to Macau, and constantly provided new opportunities, space and motivation for Macau's development," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Xi and the central government for their trust and support, while giving his backing for his successor Sam Hou-fai in leading the new government and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president and the guests were then treated to a gala show featuring musical performances, dances, acrobatics among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The congregation joined Xi in singing "Ode to the Motherland", wrapping up the hour-long event on a high note.

 President Xi Jinping visited the Macau University of Science and Technology on Thursday morning on the second day of his trip marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi’s motorcade arrived at the university before 10am amid tight security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president toured two state-level laboratories at the university, one in traditional Chinese medicine and the other in lunar and planetary science.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had exchanges with faculty, researchers and students, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  University president Joseph Lee quoted Xi as saying Macau could work with the mainland in areas such as Chinese medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xi] believes the research for Chinese medicine should be combined with the latest biomedicine to lead the world, and that Chinese medicine will take up a very important position in the world," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the president noted the achievements of the Macau Science 1, a low-latitude satellite constellation with high-precision geomagnetic field measurements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong Chi-meng, Macau's director of education and youth development, said Xi was satisfied with the development of higher education in the SAR and praised the territory's patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi had warm exchanges with residents living and starting businesses in the cooperation zone, and with people involved in the zone's planning, construction, management and services, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is expected to visit other places in Macau this afternoon and attend a gala dinner and a variety show in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday morning, a museum near the Ruínas de São Paulo welcomed First Lady Peng Liyuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng spent around an hour at the museum and met a group of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Peng] urged the kids to study history and culture well, so that they could better understand their own place and offer help in the future," said Macau's culture chief Leong Wai-man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will lead a delegation to Macau to attend the celebration events today.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan and Justice Secretary Paul Lam will be among those joining Lee on the visit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CATL said on Wednesday it had co-developed 10 new electric vehicle models with automakers that use swappable batteries, as the Chinese battery giant seeks to lead a trend it says will replace a third of petrol stations in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yang Jun, CEO of CATL's battery swapping brand Evogo, said it would roll out the first EV that uses its so-called "choco-swap" battery this month, with the remaining to be launched in upcoming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL will also look to build 1,000 battery swapping stations next year and to accelerate this further by enlisting partners to build more stations, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's largest battery maker has also been seeking to expand in new business sectors such as micro power grids and skateboard chassis, CATL's chairman Robin Zeng told Reuters in an interview in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the Evogo battery swap service in 2022, which it said would allow drivers to change EV batteries in one minute. Its automaker partners include state-owned Changan Auto and FAW and to date it has built a small number of charging stations across a few Chinese cities on a trial basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription fee for the choco-swap battery swapping service starts from 369 yuan (US$51) per month, Yang said at an event in China's southern city of Xiamen to talk about battery swapping. Zeng told the same event that the batteries would come with two standard sizes to speed up adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope, Zeng added, was that the choco-swap battery swapping stations would use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  China could eventually have 30,000-40,000 battery swapping stations which could replace a third of its roughly 100,000 petrol stations, Yang predicted. Zeng said that he expected battery swapping to make up a third of power-up solutions for EVs alongside home and public chargers by 2030. (Reuters)

 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Macau for a three-day visit marking the 25th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking upon his arrival at the airport, Xi hailed Macau's development since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, the One Country, Two Systems principle with unique Macau characteristics has achieved worldwide recognition, showcasing vibrancy and unique charm," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The country's development is rapidly advancing, and its momentum cannot be stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's vast development potential is being unleashed, and the future is promising. This is the pride of Macau residents and the pride for the entire nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that Macau has a bright future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe as long as [Macau] gives full play to the advantages of One Country, Two Systems and is not afraid to strive and innovate, it can definitely create a better tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau is a jewel in China's crown, and I always have its development and the well-being of all its residents in my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and First Lady Peng Liyuan were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as their plane landed at Macau International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will oversee the inauguration of the SAR's new leader, Sam Hou-fai, and other members of his governing team on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also conduct an inspection tour and attend a gala dinner and a variety performance, among other activities, during his stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is Xi's third visit to Macau as president, after 2014 and 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will travel to the gaming hub on Thursday to take part in the anniversary events there.

 Shenzhou-19 crew members aboard China's orbiting space station completed the first extravehicular activities (EVAs) of their mission at 9.57pm Beijing time on Tuesday, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze worked for nine hours on completing multiple tasks, including the installation of space-debris protection devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were assisted by the space station's robotic arm and a team on Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cai and Song, the two crew members assigned the EVA duty, have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission of the first EVAs of the Shenzhou-19 crew was a complete success, setting a new record for the duration of EVAs by Chinese astronauts, said the CMSA.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marked Cai's second EVAs in space, following his initial EVAs during the Shenzhou-14 mission two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Song became the first Chinese astronaut born after 1990 to carry out EVAs, said the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 crew is set to carry out a slew of scheduled space-science experiments and technical tests, while they will also undertake additional EVAs and install payloads outside the space station, the agency added. (Xinhua)
