<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China hopes that the incoming government in Canada will adopt a positive and pragmatic approach towards Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday after Mark Carney's victory in the leadership race for Canada's ruling party, paving the way for him to succeed Justin Trudeau as prime minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a regular press conference, Mao congratulated the former central banker on his win, while urging Canada to work with China to promote improvement and development of relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect Canada to adhere to an objective and rational understanding of China and pursue a positive and pragmatic policy towards China," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao also said the two countries should develop relations based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney's victory came after Beijing announced tariffs on over US$2.6 billion worth of Canadian agricultural and food products on Saturday, in retaliation against levies Ottawa introduced in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies, scheduled to take effect on March 20, match the 100 percent and 25 percent import duties Canada imposed on China-made electric vehicles and steel and aluminium products. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Deficit not a big problem for HK: Wang Linggui

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Monday said he does not believe the SAR's fiscal deficit is a major concern, citing the size of the city's economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, who's also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), felt Hong Kong remains in a strong position despite an estimated deficit of HK$87.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economic situation is not weak among developed economies in the world. Its economic growth exceeded two percent last year," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A deficit of [around] HK$100 billion shouldn't be a big deal for an economy of Hong Kong's size."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang noted the central government rolled out preferential policies for Hong Kong last year, adding more will come in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  For instance, he said a multi-entry visa scheme will continue to expand to make it easier for mainland residents to visit the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he urged Hong Kong residents to be prepared for a rise in arrivals, including the need to draw up crowd control measures.

 Hong Kong will improve as long as everyone works together to tackle the fiscal deficit, a former deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in the SAR said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Qiu Hong, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said unity is important when it comes to improving the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the deficit is a challenge Hong Kong faces in its development progress. As long as everyone works together and makes a joint effort for Hong Kong's future, I believe the situation will definitely keep improving," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qiu also expressed optimism about the city's future, noting that residents are actively taking part in national development and Hong Kong's growth.

 Businessman Irons Sze on Monday said Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is attributed to China's reform and opening up and reinforced by the "One Country, Two Systems" principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sze, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR plays a vital role in the country's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of 2024, 1,478 mainland enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total market value and 90 percent of daily transactions," he told reporters in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the shipping front, Sze said Hong Kong's ports handled 13 million standard containers in 2024, with 40 percent of cargo coming from the mainland and 60 percent destined for the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  He concluded by saying that Hong Kong's future lies in its integration with the mainland, and the city would continue to contribute to the nation's development with its unique advantages.

 An analyst on Monday agreed with Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statement at the "Two Sessions" last week that China ensured global stability.

  Zoon Ahmed Khan, a research fellow at the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said on

  , that the uncertainty from trade disputes between the world's major trading powers was creating instability, and that China was positioned to provide a steady hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world needs more certainty, the world needs more cooperation, he [Wang Yi] also mentioned the importance of multilateralism and upholding the UN system which is something that resonates with the vast majority of the world," Khan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sino-US trade tensions, Khan warned US President Donald Trump's tariffs could backfire on America.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These have not benefited the United States... he [Wang Yi] specifically mentioned that the US has to reflect, first of all, what has the impact of increased tariffs been on their own economy, on their own development."

  , Leung said the city had to build on its unique strengths and expand its global role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apart from maintaining our existing niches of system, such as the legal system, the economic and financial system, we have to explore more opportunities in terms of tech and international relations," Leung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a unique role of Hong Kong and the message is very clear: we also have to maximise some of the uniqueness in One Country, Two Systems, such as becoming an international trade dispute centre, arbitration centre as well as the only bi-lingual system that practices common law."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The first major global effort to crack down on the fast-growing industry of scamming is turning into a growing humanitarian crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  While a dramatic and highly-publicised operation by the Thai, Chinese and Myanmar authorities has led to the release of more than 7,000 people from online scam compounds in Myanmar, for many it is the beginning of another nightmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than a month after the crackdown began, thousands of people are still detained in Myanmar, kept in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions by the armed groups that arranged their release.

  The Associated Press obtained exclusive photos of people squatting in rows, stacked against each other, surgical masks covering some of their eyes and mouths.

  In clandestine calls, survivors say they fear for their lives as illness is rampant and conditions are unsafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  They sleep on floors in army camps or former scam compounds guarded by armed militia groups. In one army camp, 800 people are sharing 10 toilets, one survivor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting home is dependent on the resources available by country.

  China sent a chartered flight to the tiny Mae Sot airport to pick up its citizens, but few other governments have matched that.

  <br>
  There are roughly 130 Ethiopians waiting on a Thai military base, stuck for want of a US$600 plane ticket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their plight has drawn concern from the US State Department and demands for their release from international human rights organisations, but Thai officials won't allow people to cross the border until their home countries arrange for them to leave immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are a handful of advocacy groups operating at the border helping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand is working with embassies to coordinate the release and handover of people, but said it can only handle up to 300 people per day, down from 500 initially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gangs running illegal scams have trapped hundreds of thousands of people in locked compounds in Myanmar, Cambodia and other places in Southeast Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victims say they were lured with promises of lucrative jobs, only to find themselves locked in buildings where they describe being forced to sit at computers up to 16 hours a day running scams. Refusing to work could bring beatings, starvation and electric shocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  As outrage grew in China following the kidnapping of a young actor, Beijing pressured authorities in Thailand and Myanmar to act.

  The Thai government cut off power and electricity, and government-aligned armed groups that control areas near Myanmar's border with Thailand released several thousand people from scam centres. But no bosses were arrested. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials on Sunday said it is not easy to stabilise and expand the job market, but they expect there will be good outcomes with high-quality development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang had outlined goals for 2025 when he delivered his annual work report to the National People's Congress on Wednesday. They include a surveyed urban unemployment rate of about 5.5 percent, and over 12 million new urban jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing on people's livelihoods, the minister of human resources and social security, Wang Xiaoping, said the domestic economy had not fully recovered, while external factors may also affect employment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she expects the overall labour market situation to be stable this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With solid progress in China's high-quality development, a large number of new technologies, new products and new scenarios have been applied on a large scale. The potential for diverse and differentiated consumption continues to be released," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The vitality of all types of business entities and innovation and entrepreneurship has been effectively stimulated. All these have laid a solid foundation for our efforts to stabilise and expand employment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said authorities will refine employment policies, striking a balance between the application of new technologies and labour allocation to create new job opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minister of housing and urban-rural development, Ni Hong, said the central government attaches great importance to the healthy development of the real estate market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said market sentiment has improved following a raft of measures introduced by authorities, including interest rate cuts and tax reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first two months of the year, the housing market has stemmed the downturn and restored stability… We will work with relevant departments in both the short and long term, addressing root causes and make sure to stabilise the housing market," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that Hong Kong must closely link its development with that of the country's, as the SAR actively integrates into the nation's growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said as all eyes are on the "Two Sessions" meetings in Beijing, the SAR also needs to expedite work in three areas to align with China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  One is to speed up the technological drive and innovation for economic growth, and another is to unleash more local consumption potential by creating new experiences in spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third, the minister said, is for Hong Kong to deepen international cooperation and exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan noted that on the mainland, digital-economic industries have grown to around 10 percent of GDP, with expansion in new industries and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From AI models, online games, the use of robots to animation movies, there are constant breakthroughs on the mainland in terms of science, technology and cultural industries," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many new creative startups were born out of nowhere, and this is inspiring."
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister said Hong Kong needs to integrate the spirit of the "Two Sessions" into its social-economic development, so as to contribute more to the nation's rejuvenation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one, according to a senior Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs, who also stressed the SAR needs “capable, responsible and accomplished” individuals to serve the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the city should add more talent not only in the political arena but also innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is expected to hold its next polls for the legislature in December this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the new stage of transitioning from stability to prosperity, Hong Kong needs people who are capable, responsible and accomplished, to seek the best for the general public of Hong Kong,” Wang told RTHK on Sunday on the sidelines of the “Two Sessions” in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Each Legislative Council election should be better than the previous one. Just like the Olympic Games, there is never the best, only better. Being ‘good’ is a goal that should be constantly pursued.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that he believes Hong Kong authorities would consult different sectors, including local deputies to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, on the upcoming polls.

 Hong Kong and Macau delegates to the country's top political advisory body said the two SARs should make good use of their advantages under the One Country, Two Systems principle.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a plenary meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on Sunday, Hong Kong delegate Tu Haiming said the One Country, Two Systems principle helps Hong Kong and Macau maintain their long-term prosperity and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the first phase of its implementation has been completed, but some people still don't have a deep understanding about the principle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Entering a new phase, the advantages of One Country, Two Systems should be realised through vitalisation and an increase in volume. We not only have to develop Hong Kong, contribute to the country and bring the country together, but also have to benefit the world,” Tu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through deepening the understanding of the One Country, Two Systems principle in the new phase, we have to further enhance the sense of responsibility and mission of Hong Kong society.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Macau CPPCC delegate Lao Nga-wong, meanwhile, said Macau is an example of the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau should use its advantages in reinforcing connection with both the mainland and the world… and build the SAR into another international passage besides Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation in February fell at the quickest pace since January 2024, while producer price deflation persisted, as seasonal demand faded while households are still cautious about spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index edged down 0.7 percent last month from a year earlier, reversing January's 0.5 percent increase, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first contraction in the index since January 2024, and worse than a 0.5 percent slide estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.2 percent month-on-month, against a 0.7 percent rise in January and below a predicted 0.1 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index fell 2.2 percent on year in February, improving from a 2.3 percent slide in January, but missing the forecast 2.1 percent decline. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the central government's liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong, on Saturday said Hong Kong should take the “One Country, Two Systems” principle to a new level, and strive for better development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Hong Kong deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing, Zheng said President Xi Jinping made the remarks when meeting Jiangsu deputies, asking them to promote scientific and technological innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said the remarks were also meaningful for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong must focus on reform and innovation and walk on the new path of developing new quality productive forces,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said Hong Kong should consolidate and enhance its status as the so-called “three centres”, and as an international hub for tertiary education, and innovation and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the SAR should safeguard national security, pursue economic growth and advance development, as pointed out by Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng added that Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages under the “One Country, Two Systems” principle, and speed up the process of advancing to prosperity.

 The chairwoman of Gree Electrics on Saturday said private enterprises need continuous innovation and technological investment to thrive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dong Mingzhu, who's also a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said the country has long supported private enterprises through various forms of assistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Dong said her company's trade-in policy helps consumers gain a better understanding of household appliances and improves safety awareness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang Wenbo, NPC deputy and chairman of SANY Heavy Industry, which earlier announced plans to list in Hong Kong, said the timing is favourable given the current capital market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiang added that he believes listing in the SAR will speed up his company's international development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong officials on Saturday said they will learn from the spirit of "Two Sessions" and stressed the importance of unity in advancing the SAR's development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung said her team was inspired by the speech of Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung stressed the civil service's role in implementing One Country, Two Systems, highlighting the importance of using technology in government operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Health Bureau said the city is making use of its advantages under One Country, Two Systems to attract medical professionals and help Chinese medicine reach international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, home and youth affairs chief Alice Mak said she will work with care teams and district councillors to promote the spirit of Two Sessions at grassroots level.
  <br>
  <br>
  On her Facebook page, cultural, sports and tourism minister Rosanna Law said Premier Li Qiang's work report has provided important direction for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law outlined plans to implement the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, enhance cultural exchanges and organise major sporting events, including the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn, for her part, said her bureau will continue to push forward the development of the Northern Metropolis and enhance cooperation with the Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Saturday said Hong Kong and the mainland should work together to tackle cross-border scams, after six more SAR residents were released from scam farms in Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s vice minister of public security Xu Ganlu said the joint operation of China and Thailand achieved success in rescuing victims from Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope people trapped in scam farms can return to their families as soon as possible. The Chinese public security organs will work closely with foreign police to rescue more victims,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, Luo Zhaohui, said phone scams are outrageous, and Hong Kong should join hands with the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With our cooperation with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and through diplomatic and public security efforts, we have seen progress in cooperation with Myanmar and Thailand,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It must be challenging to crack down on any kind of scams… Hong Kong is also facing this problem, so it is necessary for the SAR to work with the mainland.”

    Catholics across China praying for Pope's recovery

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland Catholic bishop attending the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing on Saturday expressed hope for the speedy recovery of Pope Francis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Francis, 88, has been hospitalised for three weeks with pneumonia in both lungs. The Vatican on Friday said his condition remained "stable" after the pope delivered a weak and breathless audio message thanking well-wishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Fang, vice-president of the Bishops' Conference of Catholic Church in China and a Standing Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said Catholics across the nation are praying for the pope.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Great Hall of the People, Fang also noted he's been advocating for diplomatic relations between Beijing and the Holy See, though there's no timeline for when that would happen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican. We have repeatedly advocated for this at various meetings and occasions with leadership, and are actively working toward early diplomatic relations," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  In October last year, the Vatican and China extended a deal over the appointments of Catholic bishops by another four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement was reached in 2018 and was renewed in 2020 and 2022, giving both sides the power to nominate candidates.

 The country’s most senior judge has promised to take steps to counter unlawful sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction to safeguard national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Jun, president of the Supreme People’s Court, also said on Saturday that authorities would equally protect the rights of state-owned, private, and foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will promote the development of a law-based economy and a credit economy, while strengthening foreign-related legal development and firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” Zhang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his report, Zhang noted courts at all levels, across the country over the past year have cracked down on crimes that seriously endanger social order, including penalising offences involving cross-border telecom scams in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have resolutely safeguarded national security and handed down punishment on offences such as subversion, separatism, and espionage, the top judge added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ying Yong, the country’s top prosecutor, vowed to safeguard national security and social stability in the coming year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said authorities would follow the principle that everyone is equal before the law, and handle every case with efficiency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation’s top legislators on Saturday pledged to formulate and amend a slew of laws in the coming year, including one on backing private enterprises.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has moved to introduce the private economy promotion law, which is designed to ensure private firms receive clear legal protection and create a fairer business environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bill includes provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises, and requiring the State Council and local governments, at or above the county level, to provide regular progress reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhao Leji, who chairs the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), told a plenary meeting in Beijing that the law will be hammered out in parliament, as he outlined targets for the lawmaking body.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are also keenly aware that there are a number of gaps and shortcomings in our work,” said Zhao.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We need to further improve the quality of legislative work, and we should also step up our work in the emerging areas, and also fill in the short links in foreign-related legislation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting back this past year, the senior state leader said the NPC had strengthened the implementation of the Constitution, advanced a number of legislation, and enhanced foreign outreach.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Saturday announced that it will impose additional tariffs on some products imported from Canada based on the ruling of an anti-discrimination probe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Effective from March 20, an additional 100-percent tariff will be imposed on imported rapeseed oil, oil cakes, and peas originating from Canada, while aquatic products and pork will be subject to an additional 25-percent tariff.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes after the central government's anti-discrimination probe, which found that Canada's restrictive measures against some Chinese products have disrupted normal trade order and harmed the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's export growth grew slower than expected in the first two months of this year while imports fell sharply, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to customs data released on Friday, outbound shipments from China in January and February rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a gain of 10.7 percent in December and market expectations of a 5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slower pace was attributed partly to firms rushing out exports before the anticipated US tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports declined 8.4 percent year on year, after rising by 1 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the drop in imports of grain, iron ore and crude oil signalled that Beijing was scaling back on purchases of key commodities amid heightened tensions with the United States under  the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus for the two months came in at US$170 billion. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Standing Committee member Henry Tang on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its advantages and further promote internationalisation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang held talks with Hong Kong and Macau CPPCC delegates on Thursday on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang said one of the issues they discussed was the city's responsibility to promote internationalisation, it being one of the most international cities in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We understand and recognise our responsibilities in how to further the internationalisation of Hong Kong so that we will play to the Two Systems advantage under the One Country,” Tang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the same time, we are able to facilitate and to forge relationships with overseas organisations and counterparts that otherwise will be helpful in promoting relationships in this very complex political environment today.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang, who is also the chairman of the board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, said the cultural hub will continue to promote exchanges with different countries in the cultural sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said West Kowloon will help enhance the cultural soft power and allow Chinese culture to go global.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to act more firmly in safeguarding national security while recognising the city's effort in implementing Article 23 legislation, according to attendees at a meeting with the top official in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member and heads the Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, held a closed-door meeting with local deputies to the National People’s Congress (NPC) on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 90-minute meeting, the vice premier was quoted as saying the SAR made “new progress and breakthroughs” in the past year, such as enacting its own national security law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starry Lee, the city’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, said Ding attached great importance to what has been happening in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the meeting, Lee said NPC deputies must “be pioneers and lead by example”, and that security is the prerequisite for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At present, Hong Kong’s long-term stability is hard-won and must be cherished even more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[As Hong Kong delegates], we must firmly safeguard national security and have the courage to say 'no' to all words and actions that violate the Constitution and the Basic Law.”
  <br>
  <br>
  NPC delegate Ma Fung-kwok told reporters after the meeting that Ding highlighted the passage of Article 23 legislation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He mentioned that this is a very important achievement, in terms of legislation concerning national security,” Ma said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He didn’t elaborate much on those directions. He just restated that we had done a very good job.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also noted the city’s economic recovery and its increased influence globally, Ma added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong; the head of Beijing’s liaison office, Zheng Yanxiong; and Minister of Science and Technology, Yin Hejun, were also present at the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding met Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference a day earlier.

    Good to improve NSL, Beijing official says

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing official on Friday said that it'll be the right thing to do to keep improving the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sun Qingye, deputy head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the SAR, made the remarks on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a group interview, Sun, who is also a delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the SAR government has been implementing the National Security Law well over the past five years or so, but noted that it'll be good to keep improving the law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there are any issues or problems in our National Security Law, it should be revised, but this is a matter for the National People's Congress to decide," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun added that the city's domestic Article 23 laws helped to complement efforts to safeguard national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  He slammed certain Western nations for imposing sanctions on SAR officials and judges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it is from the United States or from other countries, it is unreasonable for them to sanction our judges. We have to support the judges to handle relevant national security cases well. [For those countries], they are wrong and should not impose sanctions. Why don't they sanction their own judges?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sun also rejected calls to pardon Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper who's on trial for alleged national security offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This should be handled in accordance with the law. Why should special pardons be granted? What are the reasons to grant a special pardon?
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not the son of a certain president, so that the president can pardon him."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also said it's important to enhance national security education at local schools, to help raise awareness among youngsters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday said China's diplomacy provides much-needed stability in a turbulent world.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference during the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang was asked about China's role in the world on the diplomatic front.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's diplomacy will stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human progress. We will provide certainty to this uncertain world. We will be a staunch force defending our national interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Global South, Wang said Beijing will continue to expand global partnerships and "write a new chapter of the Global South seeking strength through unity".
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the Global South, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's GDP, should strengthen themselves and strive for development.
  <br>
  <br>
  As China and the European Union mark 50 years of diplomatic relations this year, Wang said Beijing is still confident that Europe can be its trusted trading partner despite tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two sides have the capacity and wisdom to properly resolve pending issues through friendly consultation and jointly usher in another promising 50 years," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Wang accused the Philippines of creating frictions in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said trust and rules are needed to help bring lasting peace and security in the South China Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, the foreign minister said the island is an inalienable part of China and any attempts to seek "Taiwan independence" are doomed to fail.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Taiwan has never been a country and will never be a country in the future,” Wang said, adding that China will realise complete reunification.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has ushered in a golden era to develop the so-called "low altitude" economy, or even a "sky city", according to delegates at the country's top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as the annual "Two Sessions" continues in Beijing, featuring delegates at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Yang Yi, a CPPCC delegate, who is also a senior technical expert at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, said the low-altitude economy is one example of "new quality productive forces", as it has vast potential to open up a new industry while reshaping the current sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has ushered in the golden period of developing the low-altitude economy, it is now the industry's 'take-off' period, and the low-altitude economy will become a new engine of China's economic growth, to spark new consumption trends," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The idea of building a city in the sky will no longer be simply a dream," she added, noting this year's key tasks include gradually opening up the nation's aerial space, enhancing regulatory frameworks and safety, continuing technological innovation, while encouraging market engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xu Xiaolan, a vice chairperson of the standing committee of the CPPCC National Committee, who is also the vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, said the country's internet-based industrial production had expanded to cover 49 economic fields, involving some 1.53 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, a computer scientist, who is also the former vice minister of the Industry and Information Technology of China, added the latest breakthroughs achieved by DeepSeek have also been applied to various sectors including the search engines, text generating, medicine, culture, and tourism.

    China will 'firmly counter' US amid trade row: Wang Yi

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China will "firmly counter" US pressure on trade, after Washington imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a press conference on Friday on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Wang also raised the risk that the "law of the jungle" could take hold in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China-US economic and trade ties are mutual. If you choose to cooperate, you can achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results. If you use only pressure, China will firmly counter," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move by the Trump administration to impose additional tariffs using the fentanyl issue as a pretext, Wang said Washington should not "repay kindness with resentment, let alone impose arbitrary tariffs".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are around 190 countries in the world," he said. "Imagine if every country emphasised their own priority and believed in strength and status, the world would fall back into the law of the jungle.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Small and weak countries will get burnt first, and the international order and rules will be under severe shock.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Major countries should undertake their international obligations… and not seek to profit from and bully the weak.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the abuse of fentanyl in the US is a problem that must be confronted and resolved by the country itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the development of AI in China and growing popularity of DeepSeek, the foreign minister said "high fences and small yards" cannot suppress the spirit of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Where there is blockade, there is breakthrough; where there is suppression, there is innovation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that China and the US must co-exist peacefully, and mutual respect is key to bilateral ties. (Agencies)

 China wants to achieve a "fair, lasting and binding peace agreement" acceptable to all parties on the Ukraine war, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone hopes to achieve a fair, lasting, binding peace agreement that every side can accept," Wang told reporters during an annual press conference on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to cooperate with the international community in accordance with the wishes of relevant parties to achieve a final resolution of the crisis and lasting peace, and will continue to play a constructive role."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that "conflict has no winners, and peace has no losers".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister said ties with Russia were a "constant in a turbulent world" as he addressed the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A mature, resilient, and stable China-Russia relationship will not change due to temporary events, nor will it be disrupted by third-party interference," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the Middle East, Wang called for a "lasting ceasefire" between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If major powers genuinely care about the people of Gaza, they should promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza and increase humanitarian assistance," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China supports a plan by Egypt and other Arab countries to rebuild and restore peace in Gaza. (Agencies)

    'Govt should seek new revenue streams amid deficit'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former transport secretary Frank Chan says it is appropriate for the government to find new sources of income under a fiscal deficit, but it should carefully assess the impact of any new policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget last month a proposed HK$200 levy on private cars every time they leave Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in Beijing, Chan - a Hong Kong deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) - said it was inevitable that new policies would have consequences.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he believed the authorities had done analysis on the possible impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would expect the officers to come up with some kind of information and impact analysis so as to convince the public whether or not they should and how much it is to be raised," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because at the time there's a financial deficit incurring in Hong Kong, then there must be a way that we need to balance it out.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another NPC deputy Nicholas Chan said the government should also look into ways to help those being affected by policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would have to probably take a more holistic approach about how we help people who might suffer from this, and if this is - overall - good for the economy, how do we lessen the hurt on those who are going to feel aggrieved by such a move,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government also announced plans to adjust the city’s subsidised public transport fares for the elderly, including setting a cap on the number of subsidised trips per month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frank Chan said the subsidised transport fare was a welfare policy, instead of a transport policy, and that it is a responsible act of the government to review it based on the actual situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday underscored the role of education in advancing science, technology, and talent development, calling for deeper alignment with the country's modernisation needs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a joint group meeting during the third session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi emphasised cultivating talent, maximising their potential, and integrating education with national priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called for comprehensive education reforms, including granting schools greater autonomy and improving governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stressed the need to instill in students the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Education must play a fundamental role in fostering innovation and self-reliant talent training, Xi said, calling for mechanisms to align education with economic and social development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the CPPCC's role in supporting national education and talent strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi on Thursday also extended festive greetings and best wishes to the country's women of all ethnic groups and from all walks of life ahead of International Women's Day, which falls on March 8. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Guangdong official on Thursday said the province will work closely with Hong Kong and Macau to host the National Games this year, and strengthen technological cooperation to build a world-class Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Hu, the executive vice-governor of Guangdong, made the remark at a plenary session of Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a first, the National Games will be hosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same meeting, Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong expressed his vision to welcome people from all walks of life for the quadrennial gala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to invite everyone to come and watch the Games in Guangdong and the Greater Bay Area ... to experience the rapid changes of Guangdong and the unique charm of the vibrant Greater Bay Area," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming, meanwhile, described the province's proximity to Hong Kong and Macau as a natural and unique advantage, adding the two SARs connect the region to the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang thanked both cities for their support and investment in Guangdong, saying their involvement is key to the Greater Bay Area's development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang has urged Hong Kong to make good use of its advantages and to continue to safeguard national security, according to SAR delegates of the nation’s top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding on Thursday held talks with Hong Kong and Macau delegates of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vice premier, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, urged Hong Kong to be confident and capitalise on its strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a unique position of enjoying strong support of the country and being connected to the world,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Delegates from the SAR said after the 90-minute meeting that national security was one of the topics of discussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPPCC member Ko Wing-man said the vice premier praised Hong Kong for completing Article 23 legislation of the Basic Law last year, while stressing that the city should not lower its guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There are still many internal and external forces which want to mess around, in terms of national security or the One Country, Two Systems,” Ko quoted Ding as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Therefore, we have to be highly vigilant, and achieve a good balance between development and safeguarding security.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another focus of the meeting was the trade and technology wars between China and the United States, according to CPPCC delegate and lawmaker William Wong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He (Ding) said that the situation will not slow down. It will continue to be a bit stiff. But we should be confident in ourselves and Hong Kong should work together with the central government to advance technology and to go international,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another CPPCC delegate, Pansy Ho, said the vice premier highly recognised Hong Kong’s efforts in boosting the economy, saying it was stable and showed improvement in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho also said Ding urged Hong Kong to work closely with nearby cities, such as those in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because of the close proximity and also now, the possibility of us really capitalising on the various components that each of these cities possesses, we can create a much stronger base for development,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We do not have to see Hong Kong as a standalone. We need to work on how we utilise best to our advantage, how to collaborate with cities around us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong, and CPPCC vice-chairman and former Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung were also present at the meeting.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A PhD student from China was found guilty on Wednesday in a London court of drugging and raping 10 women in China and the UK, as British police warned there could be more than 50 other victims.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zou Zhenhao, 28, was convicted of the attacks between 2019 and 2023 following a monthlong trial at the Inner London Crown Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  London's Metropolitan Police said Zou used online platforms and dating apps to meet women who he invited to his home under the pretext of having drinks or studying before he drugged them.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then filmed himself raping and sexually assaulting the women while they were unconscious, keeping some of their jewellery and clothing afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou was found guilty of 11 counts of rape, with two of the offences relating to one victim.
  <br>
  <br>
  After more than 19 hours of deliberations, jurors concluded Zou raped three of the women in London and seven in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The prosecutions relating to attacks in China were possible because foreign nationals who are living in the UK can be charged with an offence committed abroad that is also illegal in the country where it took place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police have only been able to identify two of the victims and said after the verdict that more than 50 other women may have fallen victim to Zou, which would make him one of the worst sex offenders in UK history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally from Dongguan in Guangdong Province, the mechanical engineering doctoral candidate at University College London claimed that the sexual interactions were consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will be sentenced on June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Rosina Cottage described the defendant as a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” and that his sentence will be “very long.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Zou, who showed no emotion as the verdicts were read out in court, was also convicted of three counts of voyeurism, 10 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and three of possession of a controlled drug with intent to commit a sexual offence, namely butanediol.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He has done all that he can in these offences to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,” said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police are appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact them. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the people's government of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Thursday said classes have resumed in Dingri County following the massive earthquake earlier this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a plenary meeting of Tibet deputies of the National People Congress in Beijing, Gama Cedain expressed gratitude to various provinces and sectors of society that provided support after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck the county in Xigaze city.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his work report, Premier Li Qiang said Beijing would provide "quality meteorological services" to better respond to natural disasters including floods and earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will provide support for post-earthquake recovery and reconstruction efforts in Dingri County, Xizang Autonomous Region, and work to ensure that residential buildings and infrastructure in key areas are more earthquake-resistant," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gama Cedain said reconstruction work began on Monday, adding the work report's mention of these efforts showed the advantages of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman also highlighted Tibet's current economic and cultural prosperity, noting the region has experienced no major political or violent cases for 17 consecutive years.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang’s work report has offered “important guidance” on implementing the One Country, Two Systems policy, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, as he pledged to further align Hong Kong with national development strategies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People on Wednesday, the premier said Beijing will continue to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also mentioned the central government’s backing to the two SARs on growing their economies, improving people’s livelihoods and deepening international exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  On social media, the chief executive said the government work report not only set out the country’s economic targets and policies, but also gave important direction for the practice of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the premier’s message, Lee said his administration is heading in the right direction with its policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  “By following this correct policy direction and proactively aligning with the nation’s development strategies, Hong Kong’s development will have a bright future,” he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We must better leverage the advantages of the One Country, Two Systems principle and break new ground.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will further deepen international exchanges and strengthen its role as a connector, Lee added.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On top of consolidating trade ties with traditional markets such as Europe and the United States, we will also work hard to explore new markets including the Middle East, Asean countries and Central Asia, while actively striving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,” he wrote.

<img alt="Beijing says it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794488_1_20250306085151.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Thursday said the advent of artificial intelligence startups such as DeepSeek has been a boon to the nation’s technological development.
 <br>
  <br>
  Senior Fellow at the Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen’s comment came after Beijing said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
  </a>
  that AI startups have been “a revelation” for policymakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Quite frankly, these kind of breakthroughs – whether it's in film or with video games, and now artificial intelligence – this has really boosted the government’s confidence in its own sectors,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It also completely changed the regular citizen’s view and confidence in their abilities as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the government work report’s efforts to deepen cooperation with other countries, Tangen said the world is “positive” on the nation’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They’re just simply saying, we’ll continue to grow where we are welcome and continue to invest where we are welcome.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Tangen also noted the work report said that Hong Kong and Macau will continue to connect the nation with the rest of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of that has to do with trying to attract investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong plays a prominent position in that and they’re trying to assure them that One Country, Two Systems will continue and that both of these entities are very valuable.”

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Macau have the full backing of the central government in integrating into the country’s development, a senior Beijing official said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, met Chief Executive John Lee, who attended the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, Xia praised the SAR administration’s performance in recognising and responding to changes, fully promoting high-quality development, and uniting the entire society to focus on the city’s economy and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The central government has always adhered to the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle, and fully backed the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into the overall development of the country,” the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia was also quoted as saying that he hopes Hong Kong would work to consolidate the city’s status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to become a place for high-performing individuals to gather.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a government statement, the Chief Executive vowed to lead all sectors of the SAR to proactively integrate into national development, and contribute to the Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the head of Beijing’s liaison office in the SAR urged local NPC deputies to “shoulder the historic mission and responsibility of promoting Hong Kong’s transition from stability to prosperity”.
  <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting, liaison office chief Zheng Yanxiong pointed out that the delegates should take up four roles to further bolster the territory’s development – athletes, active players, doers, and leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng also highlighted the importance of tapping into the city’s advantages, introducing reforms, supporting the country’s high-quality development, connecting with the mainland and the world, as well as preventing risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Zheng emphasised that over the past few years, Hong Kong has made a number of major accomplishments, and has been widely recognised by the international community,” his office's statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year marks the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, which is a key year for Hong Kong to accelerate its transition from stability to prosperity.”

    'Mild inflation target still a concern'

<img alt="China has lowered its inflation target for the year from 3% to 2%. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794419_1_20250305181546.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists have struck a cautious note on China's plan to lower the nation's inflation target from three to two percent in the coming year, citing prolonged deflationary pressure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as Premier Li Qiang delivered his annual work report to the National People's Congress, setting out economic priorities for 2025, including a growth target of around five percent for the third year in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with RTHK, Raymond Yeung, Greater China chief economist at ANZ Bank, said while he believes the five percent growth target is achievable, partly due to improved sentiment on the economy following recent technological breakthroughs, questions loom over the nation's persistently low consumer price growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously this number [two percent] is still way above the current inflation number, which was around 0.5 percent in January. But China is still under a strong deflationary pressure as the consumer price index has been inactive for almost 2.5 years," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The question is how the government can inflate the economy. Are they going to print more money? Are they going to have a fiscal policy intensity strong enough to push the domestic demand so to restore the economy back to inflation? There are still some open questions for us to ask."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Hong Kong-based economist said the target suggests the authorities are dedicated to offering support to the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Yeung, Tian Xuan, associate dean at Tsinghua University's school of finance, said in a group interview in Beijing that boosting public consumption is a vital growth engine for the economy this year, adding that policymakers have adopted a more proactive monetary policy with expanded fiscal support to shore up demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fiscal deficit target this year, the Beijing-based economist noted, was raised to four percent from three percent last year, marking the highest level in three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will issue a total of 1.3 trillion yuan (US$182 billion) worth of ultra-long special treasury bonds this year to spur growth, including 300 billion yuan on bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes, Tian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said the measures are a good signal, but warned the issue is whether local governments will properly implement the fiscal supports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problems in the past few years were that the local government or state-owned companies, they are not really executing what the central government ask them to do. So there's a lot of hoarding of 'firepower' that has not been translated into economic growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the focus is not just whether the target is four percent, it is about whether they are willing to execute at the local level, to execute those funds."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yeung shrugged off concerns over the extra US tariffs on Chinese goods, noting that Chinese exports to the US steadily declined in recent years and now only account for about 13 percent of China's total exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our estimation is that every 10 percent increase in tariff rates will only drag down export growth by 0.5 percent of the GDP across several years, which means that every year the impact would be very, very minimal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem of the Chinese economy is always domestic, and how to revive the domestic confidence, how to stabilise the property market, so that China is not going to go through the asset price deflation. That is more important than the US tariffs," Yeung added.

 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) member Andy Tsang on Wednesday slammed the US move to slap additional tariffs on Chinese exports because of the fentanyl crisis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tsang, deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission and a former Hong Kong police commissioner, made the comments in Beijing on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on China, citing a lack of progress on tackling fentanyl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsang said Beijing will study countermeasures and the move should not affect anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he believes China is one of the world's best performers in drug-control efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former health minister and CPPCC delegate Ko Wing-man, meanwhile, said the setting up of Hong Kong's third medical school aims to strengthen medical education and research capabilities, not just addressing doctor shortages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, another CPPCC member and former Bar Association chairwoman Winnie Tam said she hopes the Greater Bay Area will recognise Hong Kong's potential to help train professionals in foreign-related legal matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tam, who chairs the Communications Authority, also said her team will continue to improve anti-fraud measures and work more closely with different platforms.

 Hong Kong and Macau will always have the central government's backing in terms of developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, a senior official in charge of the SARs' affairs pledged on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Linggui, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments on the sidelines of the Two Sessions in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by RTHK if more support measures were in store for Hong Kong, Wang pointed to the city's booming stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said if investors were confident about Hong Kong, then the stock market would do well.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, Hongkongers were told by a former Beijing official to cherish their city and build it into a better place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tan Tieniu, who was deputy director of Beijing's liaison office between 2016 and 2022, said Hong Kong had special meaning for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city is a "very good" place and has a key role to play in the country's overall development, and urged everyone to "steadfastly and successfully" implement "One Country, Two Systems".

 The head of China's market regulator has pledged to tighten oversight of the rapidly growing e-commerce sector, and promote the healthy development of the so-called platform economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Luo Wen, director of State Administration for Market Regulation, made the comments on Wednesday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, after attending the opening session of the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed to malpractice by some live-streaming hosts who offer products which are either counterfeit or poor in quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will fulfil its supervision role, Luo said, by strengthening product inspections and toughening enforcement against misleading advertisements and promotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  On platform fees, he said the aim is to establish a reasonable and transparent charging mechanism to lessen the burden of small and medium-sized merchants.
  <br>
  <br>
  E-commerce platforms will be instructed to simplify and publish their rates, while authorities will publish guidelines to help them achieve this goal, Luo added.

<img alt="Jonathan Choi said the central government's supportive measures do not simply cover the state-owned enterprises, but also private firms.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have given their backing to the country's economic growth target of around five percent target this year, saying it was no easy feat but achievable.
 <br>
  <br>
  HSBC chairman Peter Wong, who's a CPPCC delegate, was fully confident the country could meet the target.
  <br>
  <br>
  He recalled the many economic stimulus measures rolled out by the central government last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that hitting the five percent growth target last year was no easy feat, given the geopolitical situation and the world economy. But we worked hard to achieve this goal, and it wasn't easy," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 2025, I feel the country is well-planned to meet its goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong's sentiment was shared by Jonathan Choi, who chairs the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The businessman, who is also a CPPCC Standing Committee member, noted Beijing's support measures benefit companies big and small, across different sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just feel that we can achieve it, because at the moment, the Chinese government spent a lot of attention [on] local enterprises, not only the [state-owned enterprises] ... AI and also technology, new (sectors are) coming up," he commented.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, NPC deputy Nicholas Chan described the five percent growth target as a bold one, considering the scale of China's economy - the second-largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a big economy, five percent in GDP is huge. Five percent is basically the entire economy of Switzerland. With such a big pie, just a small growth is humongous," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So this will lead to a lot of opportunities for people all over the world, for people along the Belt and Road, Brics (countries), and Rcep (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership), so lots of opportunities for our friends together."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said he was encouraged by remarks about Hong Kong in Premier Li Qiang's work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing delegates at the Great Hall of the People, Li said Beijing will continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and ensure Hong Kong and Macau are administered by patriots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said the central government supports the two SARs in improving their economies and the livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who attended the opening of the National People's Congress in the capital, said the SAR will continue to unswervingly implement One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, he also said 2025 marks an important year for reforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year marks the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan, the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan formulation, and an important year for further comprehensive deepening of reforms, which has significant meaning for the practice of One Country, Two Systems," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE said he will continue to advance the Northern Metropolis development and innovation initiatives, and strengthen Hong Kong's position as an international financial hub.

<img alt="Zhou Yunjie, chairman of home appliances firm Haier, says technological innovation is a key factor to enable enterprises become international brands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese companies are doubling down on innovation as part of efforts to contribute to the national drive of developing "new quality productive forces", with leaders convening in Beijing for the annual Two Sessions meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Lei Jun, the chairman of Xiaomi, which was originally a smartphone maker but has entered the electric vehicle (EV) space, said technological innovation aided his firm's meteoric rise in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investment in technological innovation reached 105 billion yuan over the past five years, which helped Xiaomi to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, selling some 170 million mobile phones last year, Lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of its internet-based smart home devices, meanwhile, also fared well, with some 900 million such items being sold, demonstrating the popularity of Chinese tech products around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lei, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said Xiaomi would continue to invest in technological research and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manufacturing is the foundation of China and the foundation of a strong country. Xiaomi, as a builder and beneficiary of the manufacturing industry, will continue to adhere to the path of striving for scientific and technological innovation as well as high-end development, ramp up the cultivation of new quality productive forces, apply the latest artificial intelligence technology to all our terminals, to let all consumers experience the wonderful life brought by technologies, and at the same time, contribute our efforts to the development of the Chinese-style modernisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence in the country's private sector, after attending a high-profile meeting with President Xi Jinping last month which indicated stronger support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lei, Zhou Yunjie, chairman of Chinese home appliances firm Haier, who is also an NPC deputy, said that technology helped boost the company's global ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scientific and technological innovation is a key factor for a brand whether it could stand strong in the world. If an enterprise aims to go global, it has to stick to technological innovation as its solid base, to keep on innovating - until it reaches the top, so that the brand could truly be a top leader. Haier has also been adhering to such a principle, we kept looking up to international standards until we reached breakthroughs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou added that artificial intelligence was a new opportunity for China and that more Chinese firms would be able to create internationally recognised brands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts on Wednesday said China's economic goals announced at the opening session of this year's National People's Congress are reasonable and attainable.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang said GDP growth is tipped to reach five percent in 2025. It also said more than 12 million new urban jobs will be created and that authorities are aiming for a two percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Witman Hung, the Director of the Greater Bay Area Research Center of the China Silk Road iValley Research Institute, said the economic growth target is reasonable.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should never underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to meet those targets, I mean if you look at the past, they’re pretty good at forecasting and then meeting the target,” Hung told RTHK’s Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Five percent [GDP growth] is a reasonable estimate. The inflation side, two percent is a good one, it can be anywhere up and down a little bit.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the same programme, senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the Chairman of Asia Narratives, Einar Tangen, said China had the capacity to deliver on its jobs creation pledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You have to remember that China is not like the US or Europe – they’re not guessing what it can be – if they want to create 12 million jobs, they can simply take all the jobs that are being created by the private sector and then add additional jobs directly through the government or through state-owned enterprises, etcetera,” Tangen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And in terms of growth rate, I think it’s reasonable. As I said, people have to remember China is not like the rest of the world – they have the tools to do that. It also comes down to cost or how much debt they’re going to pile on, and things like this,” he added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said the nation will vigorously boost consumption and investment, with domestic demand becoming "the main engine and anchor of economic growth" as stated in his government work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures outlined is the issuance of 300 billion yuan of ultra-long treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said Beijing will adopt special measures to boost spending power, increase the supply of quality products and services, and improve the consumption environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will create a full range of new consumption scenarios to advance the growth of digital, green, smart, and other types of consumption. We will also introduce measures to unleash the consumption potential in culture and sports-related industries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said Beijing will expand effective investment and create greater synergy between fiscal and financial policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will implement new mechanisms for public-private partnership in a well-regulated manner and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects, thus creating more opportunities for the development of private capital," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that 735 billion yuan will be earmarked in the central government's budget for investment this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, observers believe government policies will not only lead to sustained growth this year but also lay the groundwork for the modernisation drive in the long run, as the country embarks on its next Five-Year Plan from 2026.

 China said its military spending will rise by 7.2 percent in 2025, the same increase as a year ago.
 <br>
  <br>
  It'll be the 10th year in a row the country's annual defence expenditure maintains single-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Military spending for 2025 is set to reach 1.78 trillion yuan, according to a draft budget report submitted to the National People's Congress (NPC) for deliberation.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, an NPC spokesman said China's defence expenditure as a share of GDP has been kept under 1.5 percent for many years.

 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said Beijing would continue to fully implement the One Country, Two Systems policy and have the two SARs administered by patriots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Delivering his annual work report at the Great Hall of the People, Li said the central government supports Hong Kong and Macau in improving their economies and livelihoods of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will support Hong Kong and Macau in growing their economies, improving the lives of their people, and deepening international exchanges and cooperation," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will ensure that Hong Kong and Macau better integrate themselves into China's overall development and maintain long-term prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Taiwan, Li said China resolutely opposes "Taiwan independence" and external interference, to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-strait development to improve the well-being of Chinese people on both sides," the report said, adding that China will firmly advance the cause of reunification.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it will boost support for the application of AI models to foster more breakthroughs in technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the National People's Congress opening said the country will pursue integrated advancements in technological and industrial innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will establish a mechanism to increase funding for industries of the future and foster industries such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G technology."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said authorities will unleash the digital economy under its AI Plus initiative, which will work to combine digital technologies with China’s manufacturing and market strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation, intelligent, large-scale AI models”, and development of next-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing terminals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time AI models were mentioned in the work report, which comes after the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will strive to create an enabling environment for innovation that encourages exploration and tolerates failure," the report added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also highlighted the development of new quality productive forces, with the aim to foster emerging and future industries, such as quantum technology and the low-altitude economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the report laid out ways the country would deepen multilateral and regional economic cooperation, saying Beijing will continue to expand the nation’s globally-oriented network of free trade areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will resolutely safeguard the WTO-centred multilateral trading system, broaden converging interests with other countries and promote shared development,” it said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 China on Wednesday said it will aim for economic growth of around 5 percent in 2025.
 <br>
  <br>
  A government work report delivered by Premier Li Qiang at the start of the National People's Congress session also outlined other goals for the year, including a surveyed urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 percent, over 12 million new urban jobs, and an around 2 percent increase in the consumer price index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In setting the growth rate at around five percent, we have taken into account the need to stabilise employment, prevent risks and improve the people's well-being, as well as the potential for growth and the conditions supporting growth," the document said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A target of around five percent is well aligned with our mid- and long-term development goals and underscores our resolve to meet difficulties head-on and strive hard to deliver," the document added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy grew by 5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also aims for a budget deficit of 4 percent of GDP in 2025, up from 3 percent a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the work report, China will support and encourage private investment, and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country will issue 500 billion yuan of special treasury bonds this year to support large state-owned commercial banks in replenishing capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said that central authorities are keenly aware of the problems and challenges confronting China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Internationally, changes unseen in a century are unfolding across the world at a faster pace,” Li said, describing them as increasingly complex and severe.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Global economic growth lacks steam, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, the multilateral trading system is experiencing disruptions and tariff barriers continue to increase.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also noted that the "foundation for China‘s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough", saying that demand is weak and consumption is sluggish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Greater efforts need to be made to address social problems and guard against risks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will stay committed to pursuing progress while ensuring stability." (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    China's Liu Jiakun wins Pritzker Prize

<img alt="Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Pritzker Prize, dubbed the 'Nobel' for architecture, was awarded on Tuesday to China's Liu Jiakun, for designs that celebrate "everyday lives".
 <br>
  <br>
  "In a global context where architecture is struggling to find adequate responses to fast evolving social and environmental challenges, Liu Jiakun has provided convincing answers that also celebrate the everyday lives of people as well as their communal and spiritual identities," the award's jury wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1956, Liu has worked on more than 30 projects in China ranging from academic and cultural institutions to civic spaces and commercial buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Architecture should reveal something - it should abstract, distill and make visible the inherent qualities of local people," Liu said in the statement, evoking his craft's capacity to create "a sense of shared community".
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu lives and works in his birth city of Chengdu, where he prioritises the use of local materials and traditional building techniques.
  <br>
  <br>
  His projects include the Museum of Clocks in Chengdu, a large circular structure with a skylight that illuminates an interior strip of photographs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Aravena, who won the award in 2016 and is chair of the jury, said Liu's works offer "clues on how to confront the challenges of urbanisation" especially because they are sometimes "a building, infrastructure, landscape and public space at the same time".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cities tend to segregate functions, but Liu Jiakun takes the opposite approach and sustains a delicate balance to integrate all dimensions of the urban life," Aravena said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who is the 54th recipient of the Pritzker Prize, will be honoured at a celebration in Abu Dhabi in spring, award organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year's prize went to Japan's Riken Yamamoto, whose projects are credited with promoting human contact and who said at the time his objective was to "design architecture that can bring joy to people around it". (AFP)

    'China GDP could be affected by US tariffs'

<img alt="A finance expert says the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794282_1_20250305085101.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Wednesday said that the latest round of US tariffs on Chinese imports could gradually reduce China's gross domestic product by some 0.3 to 0.4 percent over a 12-month period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US President Donald Trump slapped an additional 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods entering the US. That prompted Beijing to retaliate, including a tariff on US agricultural products, export restrictions on select companies and a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  Le Xia, Chief Economist for Asia at BBVA Research, said Beijing's measures were "measured and calibrated".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that the Chinese response is very firm and shows determination to the US," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, if you look at the coverage of all these agricultural products, I think in total it's a kind of maybe around 20 percent of the total US imports, so that means the Chinese response is still measured – it leaves the room for the negotiations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia also said he was not optimistic that both sides could reach a deal in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump, he's too busy, he has so many things on his agenda, like the Ukraine crisis, and imposing tariffs on other partners like Canada and Mexico,“ he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday angrily denounced Trump's "dumb" tariffs and accused the US president of seeking to collapse Canada's economy in order to annex its northern neighbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's US correspondent Simon Marks said there is currently a "massive" rift between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We heard Trudeau using language about the United States and its government that we have never heard in the past from any previous Canadian leader."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Marks said there are signs there could be a possible breakthrough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have heard from the United States commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who is a very close advisor to president Donald Trump, that there could be a climb-down coming by the US government."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lutnick said there has been an enormous amount of phone conversations between Canadian and Mexican officials and the United States, according to Marks. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the United States over President Donald Trump's tariff increases on Chinese goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The statement comes a day after Trump ordered additional tariffs against Chinese goods, increasing previously imposed 10 percent levies to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, adding that it was "strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposed" to the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US tariffs, Beijing has imposed new duties on a range of agricultural imports from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The additional 15 percent tariffs on products including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton are due to come into effect next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will, in accordance with WTO rules, firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests and defend... the international economic and trade order," the Commerce Ministry statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A WTO official confirmed to AFP that the new complaint from China had been received. (AFP)

    China to firmly defend its interests: ambassador

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States says while China needs to firmly defend its interests, it will continue to handle Sino-US relations based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xie Feng’s comments came after US President Donald Trump's order to further raise tariffs on Chinese imports, from 10 to 20 percent, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against the tariffs by announcing additional levies of up to 15 percent on various US agricultural products, including chicken, wheat, corn and cotton from March 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie said those who start conflicts by harming others will ultimately hurt themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  “On the one side, we must acknowledge the significant challenges facing China-US relations. On the flip side, we should maintain our confidence in China's progress and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, staying determined. Whether it’s a tariff war or trade war, such disputes often begin by harming others but end up hurting oneself," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie is currently in Beijing for the annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

 China vowed on Tuesday to fight to the "bitter end" if the United States pushes a trade war, after Washington and Beijing exchanged a salvo of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing up to 15 percent increases to import levies covering a range of American agricultural and food products.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also placed 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's countermeasures are to protect its own rights and interests, Lin told a regular press conference, urging Washington to return to dialogue and cooperation as soon as possible. (Agencies)

 The chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) outlined efforts to advance Chinese modernisation and refine standards and procedures at the start of the top political advisory body's annual session in Beijing on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing 2,000 or so delegates -- as well as President Xi Jinping and other state leaders -- at the Great Hall of the People, Wang Huning also used his work report to note areas for improvement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to improve the CPPCC consultation systems and mechanisms, and the mechanisms for adopting, implementing, and providing feedback on consultation outcomes," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to expand the coverage of channels and platforms for bolstering unity and friendship, intensify implementation of measures in consultative oversight, and give full play to the unique role of different sectors. Going forward, we will take solid steps to make improvements in these aspects."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also recapped the party's achievements in the past year, saying the main economic and social development targets were accomplished, while major strides were made in the country's modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Hong Kong and Macau, the chairman said a system was implemented to facilitate visits by their delegates, as well as young people from the two SARs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We continued to arrange inspection tours aimed at deepening exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau, and supported the organisation of report sessions to update young people in Hong Kong and Macau on national conditions as a form of campus outreach," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year, National Committee members held 75 report sessions in the two regions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his half-hour speech, Wang declared the further deepening of reform as both a "formidable task and a glorious mission", and urged everyone to forge ahead with firm confidence and collective strength.

 Entrepreneurs and leaders of mainland private enterprises have expressed hope that Beijing will roll out more supportive measures to assist with the nation's industrial upgrade, while balancing the development of various industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the annual "two sessions", or "lianghui", kicked off on Tuesday, with thousands of political elites and lawmakers arriving in the capital to set policy agenda for the country's strategic areas including in economics and trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, He Xiaopeng, chief executive officer of Chinese EV company XPeng, noted that while China has always been supportive of its private sector, more measures were being offered to firms that fall into the so-called "entity industries", which include agriculture, industrial production, telecommunications, and infrastructure construction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He, who is an NPC deputy, also hoped to bring XPeng's latest flying vehicles technology to Hong Kong to grasp opportunities offered by the SAR's so-called "low-altitude economy".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to let more people see the latest dynamics in the low-altitude flying technology," he told RTHK, adding that XPeng wuold also apply for trials covering flying vehicles and that there was vast potential in the industry, especially in the coastal regions.
