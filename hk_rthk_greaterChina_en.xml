<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has praised China's exceptional capabilities in hosting major sporting events, citing the country's increasing athletic prowess, during his visit to attend the 9th Asian Winter Games underway in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN), Coe reaffirmed that China is "world-class" at staging global events, as he elaborated on the country's impressive track record in hosting successful international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is world-class at staging world class events. We have three world championships in the next 2 years in China. We have the world indoor championships in Nanjing in just a few weeks’ time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  We then have the world relays in Guangzhou. And then the jewel in the crown in 2027 in Beijing is our world championships and it was in 2016 at the world championships in Beijing that I got elected as President of World Athletics. So, I consider China to be my lucky country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding his impression of Chinese athletes, Coe noted that he has seen significant progress as a result of close collaboration between World Athletics and major sports institutions in the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe also highlighted that China represents a vast and expanding market for running and athletics, which is playing a crucial role in promoting the participation of young people in sports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The importance of China to world athletics is huge. You have more people that are regularly running than any other country in the world, in 5K's and 10K's and half marathons and marathons. And that is a very large and growing market for world athletics," said the sports body president.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also critical because the Chinese government understands that running and athletics is probably one of the best sports for helping develop the health and vibrancy, both mentally and physically, of young people." (CCTV)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One person has been found dead and 28 others remained missing, a day after a landslide hit Sichuan Province.
 <br>
  <br>
  It occurred at 11.50am on Saturday in Jinping Village, which is located in Junlian County in the city of Yibin.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of midnight, the landslide had buried 10 residential houses and a production building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two people, one seriously and one slightly wounded, have been rescued and were receiving treatment at a hospital in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Due to continuous rainfall and geological conditions, the high-position landslide has transformed into debris flows, which, according to a preliminary assessment, have resulted in an accumulation of debris stretching approximately 1.2 kilometres and having a total volume of over 100,000 cubic metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 people have been evacuated to safety, and 155 have been resettled at a temporary shelter in a school in Junlian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sichuan has mobilised 949 personnel from the military, armed police, firefighting, emergency response, transportation, medical, telecommunication, and other forces to carry out or assist the rescue efforts. (Xinhua)

Officials say an increase in the consumer price index in January is due largely to the influence of the new year break.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, accelerated to its fastest in five months, government data showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI was up 0.5 percent year on year last month, up from the 0.1 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.

  On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday declared the 2025 Asian Winter Games officially open in Harbin, marking the second time the northeastern Chinese city has hosted the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was joined by First Lady Peng Liyuan, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, at the extravaganza in Heilongjiang province.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd at the Harbin International Conference, Exhibition and Sports Centre cheered loudly as Team Hong Kong, China were among 34 competing countries and regions introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's short track speed skater, Lam Ching-yan, and alpine skier, Adrian Yung, were the flag bearers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city has sent 74 athletes to the Games, the most ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  Timothy Fok, vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, said China had played a big part in the growth of winter sports in the continent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A record number of over 1,200 athletes from a record number of 34 National Olympic Committees will be competing in Harbin, and this shows the remarkable development of winter sports in Asia," he said at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has played a big part in this, not only by staging two previous Asian Winter Games in 1996 and 2007, but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the loudest of cheers was reserved for the hosts, the last of the teams introduced, with China having the biggest team of 170 athletes at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national team's flag bearers were speed skater Ning Zhongyan and freeskier Liu Mengting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guests and athletes were then treated to traditional Chinese performances at the ceremony.

 China on Friday said it "regrets" Panama's decision to withdraw from the Belt and Road Initiative, after the Latin American nation ended its participation in the project in a concession to Washington.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing regrets Panama's decision," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, urging Panama to "consider the broader bilateral relationship and the long-term interests of both nations" and "resist external interference".
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin added that China firmly opposes the United States' actions to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation through pressure and coercion. (Xinhua/AFP)

 President Xi Jinping on Friday said the 9th Asian Winter Games embodies Asia’s shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and friendship.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcome banquet ahead of the Games’ opening in Harbin, he urged Asia to hold fast to the common dream of peace, respond to security challenges and contribute to building an equal and orderly multipolar world, Xinhua news agency reported.

  <br>
  Xi urged the region to seek common progress and inject impetus into economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pledged that the Winter Asian Games held in the northeastern city will put on a spectacular sports gala which will be distinctly Chinese and uniquely Asian.
  <br>
  <br>

<img alt="The Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business said products from the mainland and Hong Kong might still be competitive after the tariff hike. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790572_1_20250206185139.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy head of a local chamber for small to medium-sized firms on Thursday said companies from mainland China and Hong Kong focused on e-commerce may still have profit margins, despite higher US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US authorities began charging an extra 10 percent levy on top of existing tariffs, and cancelled a tax exemption for parcels with a retail value of US$800 or less.
  <br>
  <br>
  A vice president of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Small and Medium Business, Stanley Lee, said while the tariff rise might have come abruptly, some products can still be competitive in the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, in traditional retail, it costs US$20 to buy an item. It's US$15 for them to buy on [American] online platforms, but it's US$10 on [Chinese] e-platforms before the rise," he explained to RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So even with [25 to 35 percent extra tariffs], it's still cheaper to buy [Chinese products] than the traditional way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who also heads the chamber's e-commerce policy committee, said his own firm was relatively unaffected by the new US policies, as his products are stored in warehouses on American soil and they clear customs regularly.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects some mainland e-commerce firms to do the same if they no longer find the parcel-mailing strategy profitable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added that companies mostly expected the trade spat to intensify, and have therefore turned to different markets in search for potential customers.

 President Xi Jinping said China and Thailand should continue to strengthen cooperation in law enforcement and security in talks with visiting Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Noting that Beijing appreciates efforts by Bangkok to fight online gambling and telecom fraud, Xi said that both nations should boost cooperation to safeguard people's lives and property.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn said Thailand is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with China and other neighbouring countries, and take resolute and effective measures to crack down on cross-border crimes including online gambling and telecom fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of her visit, Thailand cut off electricity to some areas in Myanmar by its border to try to disrupt the operations of the scam compounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  On other bilateral issues, Xi said Beijing is willing to work on a new railway project between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader also met National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji, who said the vision and direction of the leaders of the two countries led to the sound and steady development of bilateral ties over the long term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visit to China was Paetongtarn's first as prime minister and comes as the two countries celebrate 50 years of establishing diplomatic relations. (Xinhua & agencies)

    'Cross-border e-commerce unaffected by policy changes'

<img alt="The Commerce Ministry urged the US to create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790546_1_20250206171534.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said cross-border e-commerce remained competitive despite the scrapping of America's de minimis exemption for the import of small goods.
 <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how a country adjusts its trade policy, the advantages and characteristics of cross-border e-commerce have not disappeared, and are still very competitive," said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we hope that the US can follow the development trend of international trade, enhance supervision, and create a fair and predictable policy environment for the development of cross-border e-commerce."
  <br>
  <br>
  The elimination of the duty-free exemption for low value packages and US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports have caused confusion, with the US Postal Services reversing a decision not to accept parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tariffs on Chinese goods went ahead on Tuesday, Trump suspended his threats of imposing levies on Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the move, He said Beijing is ready to work with other countries to "jointly respond to the challenges of unilateralism and trade protectionism".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates World Trade Organisation rules. It is egregious in nature, and a typical unilateral trade protectionism that damages the rules-based multilateral trading system, disrupts the stability of global supply chains, and exacerbates international trade tensions," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China does not proactively initiate trade disputes but will take necessary measures in response to one-sided bullying, He added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday warned that war-ravaged Gaza is not a political bargaining chip, following a proposal to take over the region from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiankun said China firmly supports the "legitimate national rights" of Palestinians.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people. It is an inalienable part of the territory of Palestine, not a bargaining chip for political games," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly supports the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, believes that Palestinians governing Palestine is an important principle that must be upheld in the post-conflict governance of Gaza, and opposes the forced displacement of the people of Gaza,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a growing number of countries blocking access to DeepSeek, Guo said Beijing has never asked firms to illegally store data.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government attaches great importance to data privacy and security, and protects it in accordance with the law. We have never asked and will never ask any companies or individuals to collect or store data against the laws," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has all along opposed the move to overstretch the concept of national security, or politicise trade and tech issues. We will firmly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies at the same time."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea became the latest government to warn about or place restrictions on the Chinese artificial intelligence startup, saying the firm did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information.

 President Xi Jinping met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra in Beijing on Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported, as the two countries eye closer ties amid growing global uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paetongtarn is on an official visit to China from February 5 to 8, marking her first visit to the country since taking office in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-day visit coincides with the 50th anniversary of China-Thailand diplomatic relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thai leader's visit also came on the same day that Thailand began cutting electricity, fuel and internet services to areas in Myanmar along Thailand-Myanmar borders to tackle online fraud, an issue believed to be high on the agenda during the prime minister's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Xi and Paetongtarn also come as Beijing is navigating a new trade war with the United States, triggered by US President Donald Trump's 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports. (Reuters)

    China launches dispute at WTO over Trump tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 China filed a World Trade Organisation complaint on Wednesday against US President Donald Trump's new 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and his cancellation of a duty-free exemption for low-value packages, arguing the actions are "protectionist" and break WTO rules.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's request for US trade consultations came as confusion reigned among shippers and retailers over Trump's cancellation of the "de minimis" exemption for package imports valued under US$800.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tax exemption has benefitted e-commerce firms including Shein, Temu and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  A US Customs and Border Protection official said all small packages from mainland China and Hong Kong needed to have customs entries on file prior to arrival, and there was the potential for some cargo to be sent back without this paperwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Washington correspondent, Simon Marks, said this could lead to significant delays in package deliveries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So recipients are going to be told in order for you to receive delivery of this package, before you get it, you have to pay the duty, and that will then release the package from Customs," he told
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=1003719&livetime=20250206000000">
   <b>
    <u>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </u>
   </b>
  </a>
  .
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is absolutely going to delay substantially, at least to begin with, the delivery of these items here in the United States, because the customer service is going to have to look at every single one of them - and there are a vast number of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marks warned that apart from the supply chain disruption, consumers will also feel the pinch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Businesses] either have to absorb the tariffs, or they have to raise the price of the good that they are bringing in from outside the country and providing to American consumers," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's why so many economists here have argued that President Donald Trump and members of his economic inner circle simply don't understand the costs of tariffs to the American consumers, that they are inherently inflationary."
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTO said China submitted a request for consultations with the US on the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The request for consultations is the start of a dispute process that could lead to a ruling that Trump's duties violated trade rules in the same manner that a 2020 WTO ruling found that his first-term China tariffs broke trade regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such a victory would be unlikely to bring Beijing relief because the WTO's Appellate Body has been largely inoperable for years, as the US has blocked the appointment of appellate judges over what it views as judicial overreach by the body.
  <br>
  <br>
  The body is unable to function with fewer than three judges. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    USPS to resume parcel services from mainland China, HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Postal Service (USPS) has said it will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came less than a day after USPS said it would temporarily suspend the service, following US President Donald Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports starting on Tuesday alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Effective February 5, 2025, the Postal Service will continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts," USPS said in a statement put out late on Wednesday local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that its working to "implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery".
  <br>
  <br>
  The earlier suspension was denounced by Beijing, which called it "unreasonable suppression".
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing had also announced countermeasures to US tariffs on Tuesday, including tariffs of 10-15 percent on certain American imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government in a statement on Wednesday night strongly condemned the US measures, saying it might file a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US' imposition of additional duty on products of Hong Kong ignores the basic fact that Hong Kong is a separate customs territory," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a founding member of the WTO, the HKSAR has all along been upholding the principle of free and unimpeded trade. We strongly oppose any attempts to undermine Hong Kong's reputation and erode our status as a separate customs territory," the statement added.

    China vows 'necessary measures' over parcel halt

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has urged the United States to stop "politicising trade and economic issues" and vowed to take unspecified "necessary measures" after the United States Postal Service (USPS) announced it had temporarily stopped accepting parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The USPS said the suspension will remain in place until further notice, with the move coming after US President Donald Trump slapped extra tariffs on Chinese imports and ended a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government calls on the United States to stop politicising and weaponising trade and economic issues, stop going after or suppressing Chinese companies," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian at a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said Beijing "deplores and firmly opposes" the move by Washington regarding Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, China announced countermeasures of tariffs on a number of US goods, which will take effect next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What [action] China takes is necessary to protect its legitimate rights and interests. Trade wars and tariff wars have no winners. Threatening China with pressure leads nowhere," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the United States to correct its wrongdoings, solve each side's concerns through equal-footed consultation, and promote the sound, stable and sustainable development of China-US relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing also called for dialogue between China and the US after Trump said he was in no hurry to speak to President Xi Jinping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said what is needed is not unilateral, additional tariffs but exchanges based on equality and mutual respect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States Postal Service (USPS) said on Tuesday it was temporarily suspending inbound parcels from mainland China and Hong Kong, shortly after President Donald Trump's imposition of fresh tariffs targeting Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The halt will take place "until further notice," and follows Trump's order for an additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports starting Tuesday alongside an elimination of a duty-free exemption for low value packages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change, effective from February 4, will not impact the flow of letters and "flats" from China, according to the USPS website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Wednesday, Beijing denounced the move, calling it "unreasonable suppression".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a matter of principle, I want to point out that we urge the United States to stop politicising trade and economic issues and using them as tools, and to stop the unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular press briefing when asked about the development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump said he was not in a hurry to speak with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, despite expectations that they would hold talks amid the growing trade conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signalled earlier that the talks with Xi could take place early this week, but addressing reporters at the White House on Tuesday, he said he was in "no rush" to talk to Xi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US had imposed fresh 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese goods, which was followed by countermeasures announced by Beijing on Tuesday including tariffs of 10-15 percent on certain American imports. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    Australia bans DeepSeek on govt devices

<img alt="Australia's decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790323_1_20250205102715.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices, a top official said Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The DeepSeek chatbot - developed by a China-based startup - has astounded industry insiders and upended financial markets since it was released last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a growing list of countries including South Korea, Italy and France have voiced questions over how the application handles personal data and what information is used to train DeepSeek's AI system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia upped the ante overnight banning DeepSeek from all government devices, one of the toughest moves against the Chinese chatbot yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an action the government has taken on the advice of security agencies. It's absolutely not a symbolic move," said government cyber security envoy Andrew Charlton.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with national broadcaster ABC, Charlton voiced concern that uploaded information "might not be kept private".
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Home Affairs Department issued a directive to government employees overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After considering threat and risk analysis, I have determined that the use of DeepSeek products, applications and web services poses an unacceptable level of security risk to the Australian Government," Department of Home Affairs Secretary Stephanie Foster said in the directive.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Wednesday all non-corporate Commonwealth entities must "identify and remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services on all Australian Government systems and mobile devices," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The directive also required that "access, use or installation of DeepSeek products" be prevented across government systems and mobile devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2018, Australia banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from its national 5G network, citing national security concerns, and TikTok was banned from government devices in 2023 on the advice of Australian intelligence agencies. (AFP & agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced countermeasures after higher US tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it would slap tariffs of 15 percent on imports of coal and liquefied natural gas products from the US, and 10 percent on imports of crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement vehicles and pickup trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after 10 percent levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese goods took effect at 1pm Beijing time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The US’s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization," a Commerce Ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The tariffs on US goods will come into force next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry and its Customs Administration also said China is imposing export controls on tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, molybdenum and ruthenium-related items to "safeguard national security interests".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the State Administration for Market Regulation said it would probe US tech giant Google on suspicion of violating anti-monopoly laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As Google is suspected of violating the Anti-Monopoly Law of the People's Republic of China, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched an investigation into Google in accordance with the law," the administration said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also added two US firms to its "unreliable entity list".
  <br>
  <br>
  They are PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said the two firms "have violated normal market trading principles, terminated regular trade with Chinese companies, and adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies, thus severely harming their legitimate rights and interests," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said it had filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization "to defend its legitimate rights and interests" in response to hiked US tariffs on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese response was “measured,” said John Gong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I don’t think they want the trade war escalating," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Zhiwei of Pinpoint Asset Management said in a note: "I think the retaliation is not aggressive, as China only targets some US products, in response to the US tariff on all China's exports to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is likely only the beginning of a long process for the two countries to negotiate." (Agencies)

 A United Nations Security Council meeting in two weeks could be a "very good opportunity" for Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to meet, China's UN envoy said on Monday, stressing the need for cooperation because "so much is at stake," while blasting Washington on tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is president of the Security Council for February, and China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong said Wang would chair a ministerial meeting of the 15-member body on February 18 that would focus on multilateralism and improving global governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Rubio would attend the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang and Rubio have spoken on the phone.

  <br>
  "I do hope that despite all the rhetoric that we have heard from the American politicians, we can take a constructive and – I will emphasise – a professional approach to our work here in the United Nations," Fu told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So much is at stake."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he did not hold back on US President Donald Trump's decision to impose 10 percent tariffs on China from Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly opposed to this unwarranted increase and we do believe that this is in violation of the WTO (World Trade Organization) rules. So that's why China is filing a complaint at this WTO," Fu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We may be forced to take counter measures... there is no winner in a trade war," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump suspended his threat of steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the two neighbouring countries. No such deal has emerged for China, and a White House spokesperson said Trump would not be speaking with President Xi Jinping until later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fu also said China and the US could cooperate on combating climate change, drugs and terrorism and work together on technology like AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said fragmentation on AI would enhance risk and reduce benefits. (Reuters)

<img alt="Analysts believe any potential Chinese countermeasures against US tariffs would be related to the military and tech sectors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political commentator said China’s move to file a complaint with the World Trade Organisation over the Trump administration's tariff threats aims to create a contrast to the US's practice of dealing with things.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump had announced a 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties, a measure which was supposed to take effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump held out the prospect of a deal with an announcement on Monday that talks between Beijing and Washington on tariffs would happen within "the next 24 hours".
  <br>
  <br>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme that Beijing is "colouring within the lines of the international order" by turning to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, the US has not allowed any appellate judges to be appointed since the Obama administration. That means that they can't render a final decision," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I think China is trying to create a stark contrast between what it's willing to do and Donald Trump who seems to... he likes colouring outside the lines. He likes to be brash, bold. He likes to threaten people. And though he generally will pivot on a dime if things aren’t going well, it's still a very marked contrast between two different responses."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Beijing has yet to impose any countermeasures, Tangen believes they could be related to military and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously, China has a very large position in the rare earths area, it's indicated before, and has imposed some restrictions on that. You have to register to get some of the... rare earths and things like that. And they said they're not going to export them for military use. And I see that probably is where they're going to concentrate," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Regina Ip said Hong Kong has to be more flexible in dealing with incoming challenges, saying the fact that Mexico and Canada were able to delay the imposition of tariffs on their goods underlines the importance of engaging with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the one hand, you need to engage. On the other hand, you need to strengthen yourself and have an arsenal of tools to respond if necessary," Ip told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong has much less leverage being only an SAR. But we have full backing from our country. I think we need to be more nuanced and be more flexible in our approach when we deal with these sort of great power threats."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ip, who chairs the New People's Party, said people doing business in the Hong Kong are more concerned about interest rates than tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want interest rates to come down to lessen the debt burden on many of our investors, including property tycoons. The continued trend of lowering interest rates would spur our economic growth. We hope the [US Federal Reserve] would resume the downward trend of interest rates if a trade war could be avoided," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Actress Barbie Hsu, who was hugely popular across Asia for her leading role in the 2001 television drama "Meteor Garden", died from a respiratory illness, media reported Monday. She was 48.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hsu passed away after developing pneumonia during a family trip to Japan over the Lunar New Year holiday, the younger of her two sisters was quoted as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My dearest and kindest sister Barbie Hsu sadly left us due to influenza complications that led to pneumonia," the younger Hsu said in a statement shared by her agent and reported by the Central News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful to have been her sister in this lifetime, to take care of each other, accompany each other, I will forever be thankful to her and miss her."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Taiwan star's death was the top trending topic on Weibo on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans around Asia and elsewhere also paid tribute to her on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Actor Huang Xiaoming, who starred with Hsu in another drama, said he was "in shock and deep grief" over her death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've heard that truly brilliant souls are never dimmed by time -- they remain vibrant, like bubbles shining in the sun," Huang said on Weibo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stacy Hsu, a Taiwan celebrity, posted on Facebook that Hsu's "beauty and intelligence will forever remain in our hearts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hsu and her younger sister Dee rose to fame in the 1990s as a pop duo before switching to hosting TV shows and acting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the elder Hsu's role as Dong Shan Cai in the popular 2001 television series "Meteor Garden" that made her a star across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The show about an ordinary girl attending an elite university was originally based on a Japanese manga series.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was later remade in China and now screens on Netflix. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge saw a surge in travellers over Lunar New Year, officials say, with the number passing through the Zhuhai port hitting a record high on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Border inspection authorities said 156,000 inbound and outbound passenger trips were made through that port on the third day of the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since the facility opened in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday to Friday, more than 454,000 passenger trips were recorded through the port, marking a 22 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Department warned that it expected a large number of vehicles to use the bridge between Sunday evening and the early hours of Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials in Zhuhai said people were having to wait more than 40 minutes for inspections on Sunday afternoon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Sunday that it "firmly opposes" new tariffs imposed on Beijing by US President Donald Trump, vowing to take "corresponding countermeasures to resolutely safeguard our own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  Unveiling sweeping measures against major trade partners on Saturday, Trump announced an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports on top of existing duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce slammed Washington's "erroneous practices", saying Beijing was "strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it".
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said Beijing would file a lawsuit at the World Trade Organization, arguing that "the unilateral imposition of tariffs by the United States seriously violates WTO rules".
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that the duties were "not only unhelpful in solving the US' own problems, but also undermine normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China hopes that the United States will objectively and rationally view and deal with its own issues like fentanyl, rather than threatening other countries with tariffs at every turn," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said Beijing "urges the US to correct its erroneous practices, meet China halfway, face up to its problems, have frank dialogues, strengthen cooperation and manage differences on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation saw a surge in domestic trips on Friday as most people continued to travel to tourist attractions and visit their family on the 18th day of the 40-day Spring Festival.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 11.8 million railways trips are expected to be made on Friday nationwide, and authorities have arranged an additional 545 trains to cater to the growing demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of Thursday, the total number of passenger trips made by train had surpassed 200 million during the Spring Festival travel rush, which began January 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  The holiday marks the world's largest human migration, each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first panda-themed special train of the Year of the Snake was launched on Friday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  It features cultural heritage experiences, like skilled craftsmen aboard to showcase Yi ethnic hand-painted lacquer art, paper cutting, and other traditional crafts to passengers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The train - departing from the home of giant pandas in Chengdu - passes through various scenic spots along the route before it arrives at the "space city" Xichang.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities called on travellers to remain alert as travel disruptions are likely to happen in northwest and northeast China due to another round of rain and snow. (CCTV)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday said the country has made solid progress in advancing Chinese modernisation amid "complex and challenging" situations over the past twelve months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a high-level reception ahead of the Lunar New Year, the President touched on the country’s achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the Year of the Dragon, we demonstrated vitality and a can-do spirit. We endured storms and saw the rainbow," Xi said at the reception held by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with complex and challenging situations, China responded with composure and implemented a range of comprehensive measures, overcame difficulties and forged ahead with determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Going forward, the President expressed confidence that the country will continue to forge ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will undoubtedly break new ground in reform and development as long as we strengthen our conviction and confidence, confront problems and obstacles directly, and tackle risks and challenges without hesitation."

    China's factory output falls in January

<img alt="Workers producing photovoltaic modules for solar panels in a factory in Suqian, Jiangsu province. China's PMI dipped below the 50-mark in January, indicating contraction in manufacturing activity. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789279_1_20250127115151.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data on Monday showed that China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for its domestic manufacturing sector came in at 49.1 in January, down from 50.1 in December.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for China's non-manufacturing sector, which includes services and construction, was also lower in January coming in at 50.2, down from 52.2 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the combined profit of major industrial enterprises went up 11 percent year on year in December 2024, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI data in January was influenced by factors such as the approaching Chinese New Year holiday and enterprise employees' returning home for festival reunions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy hit the government's growth target of around five percent over 2024, but exports and industrial output far outpaced retail sales and unemployment remained elevated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports on February 1 also adds to the lingering uncertainty surrounding the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus reached almost US$1 trillion last year, as producers looked to shift stocks overseas to counter weak domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's outbound shipments were further assisted by factory gate deflation and a weak yuan, making Chinese goods more competitive in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Back at home, falling prices affected corporate profits and workers' incomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers have promised to roll out further stimulus over 2025, in addition to the ones already implemented last year, as Beijing prioritises revitalising domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting mainland consumers spending again would reduce producers' exposure to Trump's tariff threats, which he said could be as high as 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  State leaders are also hoping last year's policy support measures will increase demand in the struggling property sector and ease developers' financial difficulties, which affects domestic demand and local government finances. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Train stations and airports across China saw the biggest peak in travellers on Saturday ahead of the Lunar New Year, as millions of people returned home to spend the holidays with their families in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the traditional 40-day period that runs before, during and after eight straight days of public holidays, some nine billion interprovincial passenger trips, on all forms of transport combined, are expected to be made, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Train and air travel are expected to "hit record highs" during this year's migration, Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Transport Ministry said it expects 510 million train trips and 90 million air trips during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the national railway company, which has added thousands of trains to meet demand, Saturday is "the main peak" at stations before the holidays.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said it used data from ticket sales and waiting lists to predict and regulate supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  With many people working and studying in provinces other than their own, there is a large population migration around the New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many factories have already closed for the holiday, with such workers traditionally returning home earlier than the rest of the population.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Immigration Department has estimated that around eight million people will enter and leave Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year holiday. About seven million people are expected to do so through land border control points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Year of the Snake, begins on Wednesday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio by telephone on Friday, saying both sides should find the right way to get along in the new era.
 <br>
  <br>
  This is the first known contact between the two top diplomats since Donald Trump was sworn in as US president on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart had an important discussion last Friday, pointing out the direction and setting the tone for bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister said both sides should follow through on the important consensus reached by the two leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing and Washington should maintain communication, manage differences, expand cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US ties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said China will never allow Taiwan to be separated from the motherland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States has made a solemn commitment to pursue the one-China policy in the three Sino-US joint communiques and must not break its promise,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubio, for his part, said Washington is willing to hold open discussions with Beijing, and that the US opposes "Taiwan independence". (Xinhua and agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said his conversation with President Xi Jinping last week was friendly, and he thought he could reach a trade deal with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The leaders of the world's two biggest economies discussed issues including TikTok, trade and Taiwan in a phone call before Trump took office on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office, Trump has spoken about a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports. He has also threatened tariffs against the European Union, Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went fine. It was a good, friendly conversation," Trump said of his call with President Xi in an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can do that," Trump said when asked if he could make a deal with China over fair trade practices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would rather not use tariffs against China but called tariffs a "tremendous power."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we have one very big power over China, and that's tariffs, and they don't want them, and I'd rather not have to use it, but it's a tremendous power over China," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has vowed to defend its national interests over Trump's threat to impose the duty, with the Foreign Ministry saying there are no winners in a trade or tariff war. (Reuters and agencies)

<img alt="Beijing has unveiled plans to support the markets by ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788800_1_20250123122135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced plans on Thursday to channel hundreds of billions of yuan annually into shares from state-owned insurers, in the country's latest effort to support its domestic equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan (US$13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30 percent of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10 percent annually over the next three years, Wu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also said China's public offering fund sector had maintained a stable development trend in recent years, with further measures set to boost the development of this sector in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assets under the management of China's public offering funds rose to 33 trillion yuan (about US$4.6 trillion) by the end of 2024 from 13 trillion yuan in 2019, according to Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the sales fees of public offering funds would be further slashed, saving a total of 45 billion yuan annually for investors, Wu told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index advanced 1.47 percent shortly after open on Thursday while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.62 percent. The Hang Seng Index similarly gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the country's financial authorities signalled they would encourage medium- and long-term funds into the capital market to further stabilise stock performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, jointly released by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission, as well as five government departments, stressed attracting funds from commercial insurance, national social security and basic pension funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annuity funds, public funds, and other medium- to long-term capital funds were also expected to increase their stock market investments, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan aims to increase the proportion and stability of A-share investment in the portfolios of commercial insurance companies, and improve the investment management mechanism of the national social security fund and the basic pension insurance fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of state-owned insurance companies will be assessed over a cycle of more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the national social security and basic pension funds, the evaluation periods will be over five years and over three years, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have been intensifying policy support to prop up share prices as the world's second-largest economy navigates deflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They introduced swap and re-lending schemes totalling 800 billion yuan for stock purchases in September as well as guidelines on market capitalisation management to encourage companies to improve shareholder returns. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Panama complains to UN over Trump canal threat

<img alt="Panamanian authorities have launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two Panama Canal ports, aimed at ensuring the efficient and transparent use of public resources. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788620_1_20250122100432.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Panama has complained to the United Nations over US President Donald Trump's "worrying" threat to seize the Panama Canal, even as it launched an audit of the Hong Kong-linked operator of two ports on the inter-oceanic waterway.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the government in Panama City referred to an article of the UN Charter precluding any member from "the threat or use of force" against the territorial integrity or political independence of another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The missive distributed to reporters on Tuesday urges Guterres to refer the matter to the UN Security Council, without asking for a meeting to be convened.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, in his inaugural address on Monday, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities then announced an "exhaustive audit" would be launched to ensure the "efficient and transparent use of public resources" at the Panama Ports Company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company, part of Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comptroller's office said the aim was to determine whether the company was complying with its concession agreements, including adequate reporting of income, payments and contributions to the state.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has denied that any other nation was interfering in the canal, which he said operated on the principle of neutrality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," Mulino said in response to Trump's threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Mao Ning said China has not participated in the management and operation of the Panama Canal, and has never intervened in the canal's affairs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said Beijing respects Panama's sovereignty over the canal and recognises it as a permanently neutral international waterway.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Panama Ports Company's concession agreement was extended by 25 years in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States is the canal's main user, followed by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 2000, the waterway has contributed more than US$30 billion to Panama's state coffers, including nearly US$2.5 billion in the last fiscal year. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump voiced his latest tariff threats in remarks to reporters at the White House a day after taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs," Trump said of the EU. "You can't get fairness unless you do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would "straighten that out" by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10 percent tariff, saying it was "based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: "Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc was ready to defend its interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remained an important partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU's "first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate" with Trump, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs, mainland media accused him of blaming China for Washington's failure to address the fentanyl crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Daily said scapegoating others cannot end the drug crisis in the US, while the Global Times urged Washington not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has spoken out against protectionism, saying no one wins in a trade war. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would be open to tech billionaire Elon Musk - the owner of social media platform X - buying Chinese-owned app TikTok.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I would be if he wanted to buy it," Trump told reporters when asked if he was open to Musk, the world's richest man and the head of a budget-cutting initiative in the new administration, acquiring the video-sharing platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is facing down a US law that ordered the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  In one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country on Sunday, a day before he took office for a second term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive order directed his attorney general to delay the implementation of the law for 75 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  To save the company's US operations, Trump on Monday also floated the idea of a 50-50 partnership between "the United States" and its Chinese owner ByteDance, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked on Tuesday if his phone had TikTok, which is banned on US government devices, Trump said: "No, but... I think I'll get it right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok briefly shut down in the United States late Saturday as the law's sale deadline approached, leaving millions of dismayed users barred from the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the tacit co-operation of Oracle, its server provider, TikTok restored service in the United States on Sunday crediting Trump's commitment to save the app for making the reversal possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if existing users can still enjoy TikTok, Apple and Google have still not made the app available in their app stores, therefore denying downloads to new users as well as updates to those who have it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies that violate the law, which remains officially in effect, face penalties of up to US$5,000 per user if the app is accessed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, a report that Chinese officials were considering selling the company's US operations to Musk's social media platform X was met with a firm denial from TikTok. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that China and Russia should consolidate and expand bilateral relations and push for in-depth development of practical cooperation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi made the remarks when holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a video meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi stressed that in the new year, he is willing to work with Putin to continue guiding China-Russia relations towards greater heights, to cope with the uncertainties of the external environment with the stability and resilience of China-Russia relations, to jointly promote the development and revitalisation of the two countries, and to uphold international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on the two sides to continue deepening strategic coordination, firming up mutual support and safeguarding the legitimate interests of the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said Beijing and Moscow should jointly defend the UN-centred international system and the outcomes of World War Two victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said the two countries should also uphold basic norms governing international relations and practise true multilateralism. (Xinhua)

    A trade war leaves no winners: Vice Premier Ding

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned on Tuesday that no country would emerge victorious from a trade war, in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos as Donald Trump returned to the White House.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ding, who's also a Politburo Standing Committee member, told the forum that a "tug of war" was underway between supporters and opponents of economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the board with imminent tariff wars and trade wars.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The global governance system is undergoing profound adjustments. Human society has once again come to a critical crossroads.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Protectionism leads nowhere, and there are no winners in a trade war," Ding said, without mentioning Trump or the US by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has also been locked in trade disputes with the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU imposed hefty tariffs on electric cars made in China last year. In turn, Beijing targeted European brandies and opened probes into EU subsidies of some dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without mentioning the EU or any country by name, Ding warned against "erecting green barriers that could disrupt normal economic and trade cooperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  He called for a "consistent approach" in addressing climate change and trade policies "so as to prevent economic and trade frictions from impeding the process of green transition".
  <br>
  <br>
  The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Europe was ready to improve ties with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed that Europe "must engage constructively with China – to find solutions in our mutual interest" despite escalating trade tensions between the two. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China installed a record amount of renewable energy in 2024, data from the National Energy Administration (NEA) showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has committed to bring carbon emissions to a peak by 2030 and to net zero by 2060.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation added about 277 gigawatts (GW) of solar last year, an increase from the 217 GW added from the previous year, the NEA said in a statement. It also expanded its wind power by nearly 80 GW.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total installed capacity of solar and wind power were around 887 GW and 521 GW respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping in 2020 set a target for at least 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity installed by 2030.
  <br>
  <br>
  China surpassed this target last year, almost six years earlier than planned, data from the NEA in August showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  And it has built almost twice as much wind and solar capacity as every other country combined, according to research published in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing invested over US$50 billion in new solar supply capacity from 2011 to 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The solar industry has also benefited from access to cheap raw materials, readily available capital from state-owned banks, and huge engineering manpower. (AFP)

    China urges US cooperation to resolve trade issues

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788502_2_20250121174425.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it hopes for cooperation with the United States to resolve trade issues, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with the United States, properly manage differences and expand mutually beneficial cooperation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular news briefing on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the United States will work with China to jointly promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US economic and trade relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Monday warned that he could impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico next month, but appeared to delay any action against China for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his inauguration speech, Trump did not target China nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, he directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo also said China will firmly maintain its national interests, but at the same time it is necessary for senior officials of both countries to maintain contact in an appropriate manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was responding to a question on whether Beijing would drop its sanctions on the newly confirmed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was among a group of American officials sanctioned by China in 2020 over Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  On TikTok, Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular short-video app, but said he might impose tariffs on China if Beijing does not approve a potential US deal with TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order kept TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform’s users.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters from the White House, Trump said he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between its Chinese owner ByteDance and the US government, though he did not provide details on how this could be achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s CEO, attended Trump’s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.
  <br>
  <br>
  The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised he would pause the ban, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump said he could travel to China as soon as this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked by a reporter if he would travel to China this year, the US leader said, "Yeah, could be. I've had the invite." (Agencies)

    China stocks up but wary of Trump's tariff intentions

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's embattled Country Garden jumped as much as 11 percent in resumed trade on Tuesday following a more than nine-month trading suspension to give time for the developer to prepare delayed financial statements for 2023 and 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a lawyer for Country Garden, once China's biggest developers, told a Hong Kong court that the company expected to reach terms with creditors next month regarding the restructuring of US$16.4 billion in offshore debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock had been suspended from trading since April 2 pending the publication of its 2023 full-year and 2024 interim financial reports after it defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong-based Country Garden has now been granted an adjournment until May 26 in a court hearing held to gauge the extent to which its debt restructuring is proceeding ahead of a decision on a liquidation petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Country Garden were up 11 percent in early trade on Tuesday at HK$0.54, compared with its last trading price of HK$0.485 before the suspension in April. (Reuters)

 A 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck a mountainous, rural area of Taiwan's south on Tuesday, according to China Earthquake Networks Centre (CENC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-seven people were injured.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Monday executed a man who killed 35 people in a car rampage in Zhuhai last November, state media said.
 <br>
  <br>
  A court in the city "executed Fan Weiqiu in accordance with the execution order issued by the Supreme People's Court", state broadcaster CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media said that Zhuhai's public prosecutor "sent personnel to supervise (the execution) in accordance with the law".
  <br>
  <br>
  On November 11, 62-year-old Fan drove a small SUV through crowds of people exercising outside a sports complex.
  <br>
  <br>
  He killed 35 and wounded 43, state media reported at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was detained at the scene with self-inflicted knife wounds and fell into a coma, police said at the time.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to death last month, with a court saying his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice President Han Zheng on Sunday told American Vice President-elect JD Vance that there is a lot of room for China-US cooperation, in a meeting ahead of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Han told Vance that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to "implement the important consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and US president-elect Donald Trump", Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Han, who is in the US for the inauguration ceremony, also told Vance that the nation is ready to promote the stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, Han also said both sides could make contributions to world peace and development, as long as they adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Economic and trade relations are important issues of common concern to both sides. While there are differences and friction between China and the US, there are many common interests, and the space for cooperation between the two nations is huge. The two sides should strengthen dialogue and negotiations on this front," Han was quoted by Xinhua as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting came a day before Trump and Vance will be sworn in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua also reported that Han met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who became a key Trump ally during his campaign, and other representatives of the business community in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with Musk, Han said Beijing welcomes US companies, including Tesla, "to seize the opportunity and share the fruits of China's development" while making greater contributions in promoting China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk, according to Xinhua, told Han that his company is ready to increase its investments in and cooperation with China and play a role in promoting bilateral economic and trade exchanges.

File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788182_1_20250119110315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect on Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would "most likely" give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 11.45am Hong Kong time on Sunday: "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in US app stores as of late Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate," Trump told NBC. "If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not clear if any US users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent ByteDance or shut down its US operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday," press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Washington on Friday accused the US of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," a spokesperson said.

<img alt="The total number of births was 9.54 million in 2024, slightly lower than the number of deaths which stood at 10.93 million. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787977_1_20250117125825.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the number of deaths outpacing a slight increase in births.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics said the total number of people in China dropped by 1.39 million to 1.408 billion in 2024, compared to 1.409 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of births was 9.54 million versus 9.02 million in 2023, the bureau said. The birth rate rose to 6.77 births per 1,000 people in 2024 versus 6.39 per 1,000 people in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of deaths was 10.93 million in 2024, down from 11.1 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet.
  <br>
  <br>
  China three years ago joined countries with falling populations, including Japan and most of Eastern Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland authorities unveiled a series of measures in 2024 to boost the country’s birth rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December they urged colleges and universities to integrate marriage and "love education" into their curriculums to emphasise positive views on marriage, love, fertility and family.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the State Council rallied local governments to direct resources towards fixing China's population crisis and spreading respect for childbearing and marriage "at the right age".
  <br>
  <br>
  Data released on Friday showed the number of people aged 60 and over reached 310.31 million -- just a few percentage points short of a quarter of the country and an increase from the nearly 297 million recorded in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, officials said they would gradually raise the statutory retirement age from 60, which was among the lowest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Gietel-Basten, an expert in population policy from the University of Science and Technology, said high living costs and social changes contributed to low fertility rates in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We've had the aftermath of Covid and the kind of slowdown of the economy. We have relatively high unemployment rates among young people and the challenges of getting a job, but also getting a house, getting a family started,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rather than focusing only on boosting birth rates, Gietel-Basten said mainland officials should think of ways to improve quality of life and work-life balance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People would like to have children, but there's just these institutional barriers in place which are preventing people from having the number of children that they would like," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we have to focus on understanding those barriers, breaking them down, not just to increase the fertility rate for its own sake, but to actually make people's lives happier.” (Additional reporting from agencies)

    China economy expands 5 percent in 2024

<img alt="China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Friday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787956_1_20250117101930.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the nation's growth for 2024, NBS commissioner Kang Yi touched on the challenges at home and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2024 witnessed a complex international environment... and there was a lack of efficient demand, and pains in the shift of growth drivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all that, the Chinese economy withstood pressures, overcame difficulties, making a new contribution to global growth," Kang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), said it was in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the troubled property sector remains a concern, despite slight improvements in new domestic home prices, with those in first-tier cities edging up 0.2 percent last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still too early to conclude if there is a stablisation in the property market. Of course the property prices in both the first-hand and secondary markets seemed to have improved, but they are still contracting, still in the negative region on a monthly basis," he said, adding that transaction volumes still dropped around 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really need to see an overall improvement of the property prices, a sustainable improvement, because the wealth effect determines whether households are willing to spend, and also affects the assessment of the economic prospects in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities have begun preparations to resume group tours to Taiwan by residents of Shanghai and Fujian province in the near future, the culture and tourism ministry said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have yet to resume such tours since the end of Covid-19, and have blamed each other for the lack of progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The culture and tourism ministry said in a short statement that the resumption of group tours from Shanghai, as well as from Fujian province, which sits on the other side of the Taiwan Strait from the island, would happen soon. However, it did not give a date for the resumption of travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was being done in order to further promote the normalisation of people-to-people exchanges and "enhance the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait," the ministry said. (Reuters)

 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

    China welcomes Gaza ceasefire deal

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it welcomed a ceasefire agreement in Gaza between Israel and the Hamas militant group, vowing "unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East".
 <br>
  <br>
  "We also sincerely hope that relevant parties will take the ceasefire in Gaza as an opportunity to promote the easing of regional tensions," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Qatar and the United States announced a ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The truce would take effect on Sunday and involve the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a broader peace deal would be finalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday said it hoped the "agreement can be effectively implemented to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza".
  <br>
  <br>
  China would "continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and make positive efforts to resume post-war reconstruction," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will work with the international community to make unremitting efforts to promote peace and stability in the Middle East," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who holds a largely ceremonial role, said the deal was the "right move" to bring back hostages seized during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war.
  <br>
  <br>
  That attack, the deadliest in Israeli history, resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to a media tallies of official Israeli figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's ensuing campaign has destroyed much of Gaza, killing 46,707 people, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

    China 'firmly opposes' new US tech curbs on smart cars

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<img alt="Justin Lin says the potential US tariff hikes under Trump will hurt the global economy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787334_2_20250113175438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.
