<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Wednesday it hoped for "peaceful coexistence" with the United States as Donald Trump appeared on the verge of a decisive victory over Kamala Harris in the country's presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our policy toward the United States has been consistent," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao did not comment directly on the possibility of Trump's re-election, but said "the United States presidential election is an internal affair of the United States".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We respect the choice of the American people," she said. "After the US election results are released and officially announced, we will handle related matters in accordance with usual practice," she added when asked if President Xi Jinping would call Trump to congratulate him. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Shanghai-based firms that are taking part in a national expo said they plan on expanding their reach into Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob Technology and Faraconix are among the firms that have signed cooperation agreements at the China International Import Expo.
  <br>
  <br>
  TMiRob produces AI-powered robots that can be sent into isolation wards to conduct simple medical procedures, such as checking the temperature and radiation levels of cancer patients.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the effort of letting our robots running inside Hong Kong hospitals, hopefully we can combine with more technologies in the world," the firm's founder, Pan Jing, told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faraconix – which produces semiconductors for smartphones and computers – plans to expand into Hong Kong this month and invest more than HK$100 million in the coming three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its founder, Chi Law, is from Hong Kong and started the firm in Shanghai four years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The purpose of coming to Hong Kong is to bring some communication products for use in the future, such as what's known as millimetre wave, or [products] in the 6G era, as well as satellite communication chips," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said despite the global competition in chip making, he expressed confidence that his company can come up with chips and tech that are better than those in the US in two to three years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will visit China this week, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, on his first foreign tour as he seeks a more prominent position for Jakarta on the world stage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 73-year-old ex-general's state visit will take place from Friday to Sunday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prabowo was sworn in on October 20, pledging to stick to Jakarta's traditionally non-aligned foreign policy while making the world's fourth-most populous nation more active abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his first planned foreign visits since taking power, Prabowo will also travel to Peru and Brazil for the Apec and G20 summits.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also expected to go to the United States and Britain, newspaper Kompas reported last month, citing presidential palace sources.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his February election win, Prabowo used his eight-month transition period to visit more than a dozen countries – including China – to showcase a more active foreign policy than his predecessor Joko Widodo, who focused more on domestic issues like the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China must combat rising unilateralism by opening up further to trade and investment, Premier Li Qiang said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country will look to upgrade its free trade zones and further explore free trade and investment agreements with other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In the face of the current impasses of global development, no one can stay unaffected and no one can solve these problems on their own,” Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Only by steadfastly embracing openness and cooperation and working together in unity can we harness the immense strength of all humanity to collectively to foster global development and prosperity.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence over the nation's ability to meet its growth target and its economic prospects in the coming years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, Li pointed out there have been many positive developments in the nation’s economy indicating a favourable outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also had fiscal and monetary tools at their disposal, he added. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-18 manned mission returned to Earth early on Monday after more than six months aboard the Tiangong space station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu are "in good physical condition," after touching down in the return capsule of their Shenzhou spaceship at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  After leaving the capsule, the trio thanked the country and the people, saying they hope to continue contributing to the country's space programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Manned Space Agency described the mission as "a complete success".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ye, the Shenzhou-18 mission commander, has become the first Chinese astronaut with an accumulative spaceflight time of more than a year, setting a new record for the longest duration of stay in orbit by a Chinese astronaut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese astronauts have flown to space in successive missions. I believe that the record of the duration in orbit will be broken in the near future," Ye said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Cong, who has just completed his first-ever space adventure, said that the crew was united as one and worked closely with the ground team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Guangsu also returned from his first spaceflight. "We have all enjoyed the unique experience of weightlessness. It is exciting to return to Earth, but we are also unwilling to part the wonders of the space," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio later arrived in Beijing by plane. They will enter a period of medical quarantine and undergo comprehensive medical examinations and health evaluations, and meet with the press afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three men had travelled to Tiangong in late April and were met on October 30 by three new astronauts, with whom they conducted a five-day handover before making their return journey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing earlier said it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai has vowed to diversify the SAR's economy, a day after receiving his formal appointment letter from Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  He also said on Saturday that he was deeply honoured for his official appointment as the chief executive for the sixth term of the Macau government.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping met Sam, a former Macau top judge, in Beijing on Friday, saying the central government fully endorses and trusts the incoming chief executive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters upon returning to Macau, Sam pledged to accurately and comprehensively implement One Country, Two Systems, safeguard national security, and support growth of its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Economic diversification is an issue of great concern to President Xi and central authorities. We must continue to create conditions on this front in the future, and steadily promote economic diversification," Sam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the new government set to be sworn in on December 20, Sam said he aimed to hand in a list of the proposed governing team to Beijing within a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won 394 votes from a 400-strong election committee in the CE election on October 13.

 President Xi Jinping on Friday met Macau's Chief Executive-elect Sam Hou-fai at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that Beijing will continue to firmly implement the principles of One Country, Two Systems; Macau people governing Macau; and a high degree of autonomy.

  Sam said he was deeply honoured and keenly aware of the responsibility, pledging to fully implement One Country, Two Systems and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan says it's extraordinary that Hong Kong scientists are joining the country's latest Antarctica exploration, with icebreakers Xuelong and Xuelong 2 setting sail along with a third ship on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mission to the South Pole is China's 41st and will last for more than half a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the ships' journey, Chan said Hongkongers' participation in the mission marks an important milestone.

  "Not only does this show the country's recognition of Hong Kong's polar scientific research, it also highlights how the SAR can play a pro-active role in the country's scientific research missions," the minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan expressed the hope that local scientists can make full use of the country's platform to conduct solid research and make greater contributions to the nation in science and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that this year is the 40th anniversary of the start of China's polar expeditions, saying the country's efforts and achievements attract global attention and reflect a powerful nation's responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation has conducted its first dual aircraft carrier formation exercise in the South China Sea, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV said the drills involving the Liaoning and Shandong that took place "in an area of the South China Sea" intended to "hone and enhance the combat capability of the aircraft carrier formation system”.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a post accompanied by a video of jets taking off from and landing on the two carriers, CCTV said the exercises also took place in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea. Xinhua News Agency said the drills “featured multiple subjects under real-combat circumstances”.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reports did not specify when the exercises took place, though they said the broader naval mission had overlapped with public holidays that spanned late September to October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, having been commissioned in 2012. The Shandong entered service in 2019, while a third carrier, the Fujian, is undergoing sea trials. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday said it was "concerned" over the situation on the Korean Peninsula, after Pyongyang said it had test-fired one of its most powerful missiles to boost its nuclear deterrent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The launch was North Korea's first weapons test since being accused of sending soldiers to Russia, with South Korea's military saying that its "initial judgement" was that the projectile may have been a "new solid-propelled long-range ballistic missile".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it was "concerned about developments on the [Korean] peninsula".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... has consistently maintained that preserving peace and stability on the peninsula and promoting the process of political resolution to the peninsula issue aligns with the common interests of all parties," ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope all parties will make efforts toward this goal," he told a regular press briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The launch came hours after US and South Korean defence chiefs called on Pyongyang to withdraw its troops from Russia, warning that North Korean soldiers in Russian uniforms were being deployed for possible action against Ukraine. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
 <br>
  <br>
  The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

 The three astronauts of the Shenzhou-19 spaceflight mission have entered the Tiangong space station and met with three others, starting a new round of in-orbit crew handover.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-18 crew opened the hatch at 12.51pm on Wednesday (Beijing time) and greeted the new arrivals, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six crew members then took group pictures for the fifth space get-together in China's aerospace history. They will live and work together for about five days to complete planned tasks and handover work.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 astronauts – Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze – will stay at the Tiangong space station for approximately six months and conduct a series of experiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 blasted off early Wednesday morning atop a Long March-2F rocket.
  <br>
  <br>
  China declared the launch a "complete success".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-18 crew, meanwhile, is set to return to Earth on Monday. (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday said they firmly opposed new rules announced by the US Treasury that will prohibit US-headquartered firms, citizens, and permanent residents from engaging in transactions involving cutting-edge technology with China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The restrictions will take effect on January 2, targeting investments in the fields of semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China firmly opposes the United States issuing final rules on investment restrictions on China and has lodged stern representations with the United States," a spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States has generalised the concept of national security," the statement said, calling the restrictions a "typical non-market practice".
  <br>
  <br>
  The rules will "damage the interests" of firms in both China and the United States, the statement warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  China "reserves the right to take measures", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury assistant secretary for investment security Paul Rosen had said in a statement that the areas targeted by the latest US curbs "are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications".
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will also be required under the rules to inform authorities about investments in some less advanced technologies that could threaten US national security, the department added. (AFP)

 An astrophysicist said the country's first civilian female astronaut, who joined the Shenzhou-19 spaceship, will inspire young women to join fields typically dominated by men.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wang Haoze was among three astronauts who blasted off to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Quentin Parker, director of Laboratory for Space Research at the University of Hong Kong, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that having the nation's only female spaceflight engineer onboard is significant towards the development of gender equality among industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a couple of missions back, we had the first civilian taikonaut who went up, Professor Gui [Haichao] from Beihang University, in Beijing. He was the first person that wasn't from the Chinese People's Liberation Army to actually go to space... Now we've got the first female flight engineer, which I think is an excellent thing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think, as a role model for young Chinese women aspiring to get into what traditionally has been a male domain of engineering, more and more females are occupying all areas of technology opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from carrying out 86 science research and technology tests, the trio's mission also includes installing protective devices against space debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Space debris is becoming more and more of an existential threat to everything in low Earth orbit, actually. And what that is, is you're (going to get) the threat of cascading catastrophic collapse of the environment in low Earth orbit," Parker said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The astrophysicist believes that the Chinese space station, which he said is only a third of a size of the international space station, will be expanded in the next couple of years.

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent

<img alt="China-made Teslas will be taxed an addition 7.8 percent, Chinese car giant Geely faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776781_1_20241030075912.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said China "does not approve of or accept" the move, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ministry spokesperson added that Beijing has already appealed to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

    Shenzhou-19 blasts off for Tiangong space station

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three Chinese astronauts including the country's only woman spaceflight engineer blasted off on a "dream" mission to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Wednesday
 <br>
  <br>
  The new Tiangong team will carry out experiments with an eye to the space programme's ambitious goal of placing astronauts on the Moon by 2030 and eventually constructing a lunar base.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spacecraft Shenzhou-19 and its three crew lifted off atop a Long March-2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 4.27am, according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The space agency deemed the launch a "complete success", Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the Shenzhou-19 flight ... 86 space sci-tech experiments will be carried out in the fields of space life sciences, microgravity physics, materials, medicine, new technologies," Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), said in a press conference on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of these experiments is expected to involve exposing bricks made from simulated lunar soil to conditions in space.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the tests prove successful, the bricks could be a key material used in the construction of a permanent lunar research station, which China hopes to complete by 2035, as it would in theory be more convenient than transporting building materials from Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bricks will be sent in a separate uncrewed cargo spaceflight to the Shenzhou-19 crew next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the crew on the Shenzhou-19 is Wang Haoze, 34, who is China's only female spaceflight engineer, according to the CMSA. She is the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like everyone else, I dream of going to the space station to have a look," Wang told a media gathering on Tuesday alongside her fellow crew members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meticulously complete each task and protect our home in space," she said. "I also want to travel in deep space and wave at the stars."
  <br>
  <br>
  Headed by Cai Xuzhe, the team will return to Earth in late April or early May next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cai, a 48-year-old former air force pilot, brings experience from a previous stint aboard Tiangong as part of the Shenzhou-14 mission in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having been selected for the new crew, taking on a new role, facing new tasks and new challenges, I feel the honour of my mission with a great responsibility," said Cai.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crew currently aboard the Tiangong space station is scheduled to return to Earth on November 4 after completing handover procedures with the incoming astronauts, CMSA’s Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou crewed spaceflights have been a regular fixture of China's space program for the past two decades and have increased in frequency in recent years as China built and began operating its "Tiangong" space station, officially completed in November 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crewed by teams of three astronauts that are rotated every six months, Tiangong is the programme's crown jewel. Beijing says it is on track to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030, where it intends to construct a base on the lunar surface. (Agencies)

 The nation's only female spaceflight engineer will be among a fresh crew of three astronauts that will travel to the Tiangong space station.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhou 19 crewmember Wang Haoze will become the third Chinese woman to take part in a crewed mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang was introduced on Tuesday along with her fellow crewmates Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center before their scheduled blast off at 4.27am on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m full ready for the mission,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I would devote all my energy and focus and attention to this mission. Together with my colleagues we are about to explore the universe and space. With every sunrise and sunset, we’d like to make them the landmarks of our journey to the universe.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Manned Space Agency said the Shenzhou 19 team will carry out their mission before returning to Earth in "late April or early May next year".
  <br>
  <br>
  Many duties await the new crew including science and application tests, and installing protective devices against space debris. Wang said she was looking forward to conducting these tasks.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I also would like to fly around in space and also wave towards the stars. I would also like to look back from space to see our planet Earth and our motherland.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua News Agency said the Shenzhou-19 crew will complete an in-orbit rotation with the Shenzhou-18 trio and stay at the space station for about six months. During this time, they will witness the arrival of the Tianzhou-8 cargo craft and the Shenzhou-20 crewed spaceship and even celebrate the Lunar New Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Song Lingdong said he wanted to send a special Spring Festival greeting from space.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For my first visit to space, I have this privilege to celebrate this important festival for Chinese people in space and on Earth. We can share the same moment of celebration and we can also send greetings for the Lunar New Year from space.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tiangong space station is the crown jewel of the nation's space programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has ramped up plans to achieve its space dream, with Beijing saying it aims to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday told the Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan that world peace and development are still facing formidable challenges and urged the group to be a "stabiliser" to ensure global security.
 <br>
  <br>
  Addressing other leaders of Brics nations on the final day of the summit, Xi noted that China is doing what it can to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to advance the ceasefire efforts in Gaza and to start new initiatives to make sure that the war will not extend to Lebanon," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said that the "common march of the Global South towards modernity is a major event in world history".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to show collective wisdom and strength to make our contribution and show the responsibilities to build a community of shared future for mankind. We have to uphold peace and achieve common security," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be the stabiliser to ensure security and also to continue our efforts to solve problems to ensure global security."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brics grew out of meetings between China, Russia, and India, who then began to meet more formally, eventually adding Brazil, then South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. (Additional reporting by AFP, Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has urged China and India to strengthen communication and cooperation during talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the Brics summit in Kazan, Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first bilateral meeting in five years between the two leaders on Wednesday came days after the countries reached a deal on their contested border.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said the two sides should resolve conflicts and differences and realise each other's development dreams.
  <br>
  <br>
  State media also quoted the president as saying China and India should "shoulder international responsibilities, set an example for developing countries to seek strength through unity, and contribute to a multi-polar world and democratisation of international relations".
  <br>
  <br>
  Modi, for his part, said mutual trust will guide ties with China, welcoming the consensus over the border issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "India-China relations are important for the people of our countries, and for regional and global peace and stability," Modi said on X. "Mutual trust, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity will guide bilateral relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and Modi last held formal bilateral talks in October 2019 in the southern Indian town of Mamallapuram.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also met other leaders on the sidelines of the Brics summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, Xi said an early ceasefire and ending the war in Gaza are key to easing regional tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  And in talks with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Xi said Beijing stands ready to work with Cairo to push for an early end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and ease tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also welcomed Egypt's participation in the Brics summit for the first time as a full member.
  <br>
  <br>
  World leaders called for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine at the summit meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin said he welcomed offers to mediate in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin also said the summit's agenda covered the deepening of financial cooperation, including the development of alternatives to Western-dominated payment systems, as well as settling regional conflicts and moving to expand the Bric group of countries. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday called on member countries to build Brics for peace and act as guardians of common security in an address at their summit in Kazan, Russia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi also spoke about three principles to help defuse the Ukraine crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his speech, the president urged Brics countries to advocate peaceful co-existence and harmony between civilizations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Brics members should support sustainable development, and that China is willing to leverage its advantages to expand cooperation with the bloc in green industries, clean energy and green minerals.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Ukraine, Xi urged Brics nations to uphold the three principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party, with an aim towards de-escalating the crisis as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian President Vladimir Putin has welcomed offers by Brics leaders to mediate in the conflict, his spokesman said Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many countries "expressed a desire to contribute more actively" to resolving the conflict, state media cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as telling reporters on the sidelines of the summit. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's industry chief told Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing on Wednesday that he hoped the US tech giant would continue to deepen its presence in the country, an official statement on their meeting showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped "Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market", according to a ministry statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jin also said he hoped Apple would "increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to expand high-level opening up," Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a "better environment" for global investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's meeting saw the two exchange views on topics including "Apple's development in China, network data security management, [and] cloud services", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cook is visiting China for the second time this year, a trip that has seen him meet with university students and try out the iPhone 16's camera in a historic Beijing district with fashion photographer Chen Man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm fell to number six in a ranking of smartphone vendors in China during the second quarter of the year – from number three during the same period last year – according to analysis firm Canalys. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other world leaders have arrived in the Russian city of Kazan for the Brics summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi was greeted at the airport by Russian officials upon his arrival on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailed ties between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, and the international situation is chaotic and intertwined," Xi told Putin, praising the "profound friendship" between Beijing and Moscow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ties have "injected strong impetus into the development, revitalisation and modernisation of the two countries" and have "made important contributions to upholding international equity and justice," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the two sides "have found the right way for neighbouring major countries to get along with each other which features non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party," according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are among the leaders joining the Brics gathering in Kazan.
  <br>
  <br>
  United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is also undertaking his first trip to Russia since April 2022 to attend the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov touted the summit as the largest foreign-policy event ever held by Russia, with 36 countries attending and more than 20 of them represented by heads of state.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Putin, the three-day meeting also offers a powerful way to demonstrate the failure of US-led efforts to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brics alliance, which initially comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded rapidly to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members, and a few others have expressed an interest in joining. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Tuesday it had reached a "resolution" with India over issues related to the border, after New Delhi said it had struck a deal with central authorities for military patrols along the frontier.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Recently, China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels on issues relating to the China-India border. Currently, the two sides have reached a resolution on the relevant issues," Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and India, the world's two most populous nations, have regularly accused each other of trying to seize territory along a narrow strip of land known as the Line of Actual Control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a border skirmish in 2020 that killed four Chinese soldiers, and at least 20 Indian ones, both sides pulled back tens of thousands of troops and agreed not to send patrols into the Line of Actual Control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said on Tuesday that Beijing "gives its positive approval" to the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the next stage, we will work with India to properly implement that resolution," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin, however, did not say whether the deal paved the way for an official meeting between President Xi Jinping and India's leader Narendra Modi at the Brics summit in Russia this week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi has told visiting former French prime minister Laurent Fabius that he hopes China and the European Union (EU) could find ways to resolve trade tensions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has voiced opposition to an EU decision to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and has imposed tariffs on EU brandy imports as part of the trade row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said setbacks in bilateral economic and trade relations do not serve the interests of either side in his talks with Fabius, who's now president of the French Constitutional Council, in Beijing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign minister said the two sides should find ways to address their respective concerns through negotiation and consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fabius stressed the need to resolve disputes through dialogue as well. (Agencies)

<img alt="China's central bank has cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.10 percent from 3.35 percent, and the five-year LPR has been cut to 3.6 percent from 3.85 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775422_1_20241021095449.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)

 The Chinese Consulate in Myanmar’s second-largest city has been slightly damaged by an explosive device.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blast occurred at the consulate office in central Mandalay, south of the sprawling Royal Palace, around 7pm on Friday, local media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were no casualties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Myanmar military blamed "terrorists" for the explosion that damaged roof tiles on the two-storey consulate, adding that security forces were investigating in order to arrest anyone found responsible.
  <br>
  <br>
  No public claims of responsibility were made for the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, a resident living near the consulate in Mandalay’s Chanmyathazi township said security around the site has since been tightened, with nearby roads closed after the explosion.

    China's economy grows 4.6 percent in third quarter

<img alt="The 4.6 percent third-quarter GDP growth was down from 4.7 percent from the previous three-month period, but consumption and output rose. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775107_2_20241018132720.jpg&q=15">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy grew by 4.6 percent in the third quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous three-month period, while consumption and factory output figures beat forecasts last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Officials addressing a post-data press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, underpinned by further policy support and another cut to the amount banks must hold in reserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on our comprehensive assessment, the economy in the fourth quarter is expected to continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September. We are fully confident in achieving the full-year target," Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said in a statement that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first three quarters, China's factory output rose 5.8 percent, while retail sales expanded 3.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, property investment sank 10.1 percent and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of the release of the new data, state media said China’s top banks had cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year as part of a move to boost lending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland policymakers have in recent weeks unveiled a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank on Friday launched one such measure – a swap facility for funds and insurers with an "initial application quota exceeding 200 billion yuan", state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mechanism implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will provide greater liquidity for capital markets, which policymakers hope will offer support for the wider economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  And in a possible sign of more relief to come, PBoC chief Pan Gongsheng said on Friday that officials were considering a further cut to the amount commercial lenders must hold in reserve before the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, China's finance minister pledged to "significantly increase" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package. (Agencies)

    Chinese banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits

<img alt="China's major banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775090_2_20241018133403.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top banks on Friday cut interest rates on deposits in yuan for the second time this year, state media said, as Beijing seeks to boost sluggish consumption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    China boosts credit to shore up property market

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
  <br>
  <br>
  In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Far beneath the lush landscape of southern China, a sprawling subterranean laboratory aims to be the world's first to crack a deep scientific enigma.
 <br>
  <br>
  China has emerged as a science powerhouse in recent years, with the country's leadership pouring billions of dollars into advanced research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its latest showpiece is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno), a state-of-the-art facility for studying the minuscule subatomic particles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is an "exciting" opportunity to delve into some of the universe's most fundamental -- but elusive -- building blocks, according to Patrick Huber, director of the Center for Neutrino Physics at the American university Virginia Tech, who is not involved in the facility's research.
  <br>
  <br>
  International media was recently given a tour of the observatory in Kaiping, Guangdong province, organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's national science agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lab is reached by a funicular train that travels down a tunnel to a cavern built 700 metres underground to limit radiation emissions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inside stands the neutrino detector, a stainless steel and acrylic sphere around 35 metres in diameter, crisscrossed by cables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one has built such a detector before," Wang Yifang, Juno's project manager and director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, said as workers in hard hats applied the finishing touches to the gleaming orb.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can see from the scale, it was technologically complicated," Wang said as he waved a laser pen over different parts of the installation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Started in 2014, Juno has cost around 2.2 billion yuan to build and is due for completion next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  It aims to solve a fundamental physics puzzle about the particles' nature faster than scientists in the United States, a world leader in the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its research could also help us better understand planet Earth, the Sun, and other stars and supernovas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
 <br>
  <br>
  Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world," Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi pointed out that China-US relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world, which have a bearing on the future and destiny of mankind, according to the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has always handled China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and has always believed that the success of China and the United States is an opportunity for each other," Xi said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China unveiled an ambitious mid to long-term development plan for its space science programme on Tuesday, which will guide the country's space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050.
 <br>
  <br>
  The programme, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration and the China Manned Space Agency at a press conference on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, the panoramic view of the Sun and Earth, the search for habitable planets, and the study biological and physical sciences in space. This includes examining black holes and finding signs of extraterrestrial life.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our country’s space science research in general is still in an initial stage,” Ding Chibiao, a vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a news conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a weakness that must be addressed on the path of building an aerospace power.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the operation of its space station, implementing its manned missions to the moon as well as expanding its planetary exploration missions. (Xinhua/AP)

    SCO summit to boost economic opportunities: expert

<div class="itemFullText">
 Regional leaders on Tuesday arrived in Pakistan's capital Islamabad to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Security in the city is tight for the 23rd SCO summit, with Pakistan deploying 10,000 security personnel, including the army.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SCO is the world's largest regional bloc in terms of geographic scope, and covers more than 40 percent of the world's population.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilisation Research and Development, said enhancing economic opportunities will be high on the summit's agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is creating economic linkages through trade and establishing special economic zones," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the last few years, China has increased its trade with SCO members, it's around US$383 billion right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another topic that will likely top the agenda, according to Ramay, is regional cooperation to combat terrorism, which has been a big issue for host Pakistan, with the country suffering the recent deadly attacks in Karachi in early October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramay also said that more countries, like Saudi Arabia, are looking to join the SCO, but he underscored the difference between the SCO and other regional groups.
  <br>
  <br>
  "SCO is a partnership organisation, not an alliance or a bloc, like BRICS, thus leaves it more to its members to decide to what extent they want to enhance cooperation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, ahead of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sharif and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.

 After arriving in Islamabad, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Li landed in the city ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the premiers held delegation-level talks. Sharif's office said that he and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  They both also inaugurated virtually the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in southwestern Balochistan province in a ceremony telecast live by Pakistan's state run TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li hailed the new international airport as a vivid illustration of the special friendship between China and Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and Pakistani leaders, the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership has been continuously deepened, and the China-Pakistan ironclad friendship, which has stood the test of changes in the international situation, is unbreakable, Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier also met with the country's top military officials including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Army Sahir Shamshad Mirza, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Pakistan have always respected and supported each other, Li said that the two countries are good brothers and good partners who have stood the test of the changing international landscape and truly shared weal and woe and helped each other.

<img alt="Giant Panda statues are seen at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774560_1_20241015110842.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two giant pandas on Tuesday departed the mainland for a zoo in the US capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bao Li, a male panda, and female Qing Bao, both three years old, were headed to the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington under a decade-long breeding and research agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and the United States have made orderly arrangements... to ensure that the two giant pandas will arrive at the Washington National Zoo safely and smoothly," the China Wildlife Conservation Association said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lu Yongbin, party secretary of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda committee, said at the farewell ceremony in Sichuan that the new round of China-US cooperation will boost bilateral collaboration in endangered species and biodiversity protection and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bao Li and Qing Bao were accompanied by an experienced breeder and a veterinarian to help them adapt quickly to their new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a few of the beloved black-and-white bears remain in the US after almost all were returned to China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts – including all three of the National Zoo's pandas last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping said after meeting his counterpart Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people".
  <br>
  <br>
  In August, San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to be sent by the nation to the US in 21 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anticipation for the pandas' arrival in Washington was high, with the National Zoo's website emblazoned with a banner that read: "The pandas are coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Something "giant" is "coming to Washington", the zoo said in a post on X, adding that it would be closed on Tuesday but that for "the safety of the pandas and staff, we will not disclose any additional timing".
  <br>
  <br>
  Preparations were well underway at the zoo, where pandas have been star attractions for decades. Renovations have been undertaken at the panda habitat "to enhance the safety of the facilities and maximise space for the bears to roam", according to the zoo's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new structures constructed for the pandas include shallow pools to allow them to bathe and bamboo stands that require the bears to mimic the foraging techniques they would use in the wild.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bears will not, however, be available to the public for more than a month after their arrival, as they will need to be quarantined and to acclimate to their new habitat.
  <br>
  <br>
  While en route, the pandas' in-flight meals will include bamboo shoots, carrots and Chinese cornbread, the China Wildlife Conservation Association said. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China's exports grew at the slowest pace in five months in September, suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from several trade partners and that global demand for Chinese goods is softening.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was "fully confident" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Premier Li Qiang landed in the city on Monday ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li's visit is the first by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years, Pakistan's Prime Minister's Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at the airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has announced a three-day public holiday in Islamabad, with schools and businesses shut and large contingents of police and paramilitary forces deployed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan army troops will be responsible for the security of the capital's Red Zone, the location of the parliament and a diplomatic enclave and where most of the meetings will take place, according to the interior ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The threat alert has been high in the South Asian nation ahead of the SCO summit, especially after the killing of two Chinese engineers and shooting to death of 21 miners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions have mounted after jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan called for a protest on October 15 to press for his release and agitate against the coalition government, following violent clashes between his party loyalists and security forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamabad has sought to curb all movement of Chinese nationals in the city, citing fears they could be targets for violence from separatist militants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23rd meeting of the SCO, which comprises nine full members including China, India, Iran and Russia, is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Islamabad.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as attending the SCO summit, Li is also undertaking a four-day bilateral visit to Pakistan from Monday to Thursday, accompanied by senior officials, Pakistan's foreign office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead their respective delegations to discuss economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li will also inaugurate the CPEC funded Gwadar International Airport in restive southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, Pakistan's prime minister's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Li, the SCO participants will be represented by the prime ministers of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as the first vice president of Iran and external affairs minister of India. (Reuters)

    China holds military drills in Taiwan Strait

<img alt="A graphic broadcast by state broadcaster CCTV shows the area of the military drills being held around Taiwan." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774393_1_20241014112649.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China launched military drills near Taiwan on Monday, in what it said was a stern warning against the "separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces".
 <br>
  <br>
  Captain Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills, dubbed Joint Sword-2024B, "test the joint operations capabilities of the theater command's troops".
  <br>
  <br>
  The command published a map showing nine areas around Taiwan where the drills were taking place – two on the island's east coast, three on the west coast, one to the north and three around smaller islands next to the mainland coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ships and aircraft are approaching Taiwan in "close proximity from different directions", focusing on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, blockading key ports and areas, assaulting maritime and ground targets and "joint seizure of comprehensive superiority", Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan independence' forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coast guard was also dispatched to conduct inspections around the island. A diagram released by the coast guard showed four fleets encircling Taiwan and moving in an anticlockwise direction around the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drills come after Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te gave an speech last Thursday saying China had no right to represent the island, drawing condemnation from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, state media have run a series of stories and commentaries denouncing Lai's speech, and on Sunday the Eastern Theatre Command released a video saying it was "prepared for battle".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PLA's Liberation Army Daily newspaper wrote on Monday that "those who play with fire get burned!".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As long as the 'Taiwan independence' provocations continue, the PLA's actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop," the paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taiwan’s mainland affairs council has condemned the drills as "blatant provocations" that it said seriously undermined regional peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities on the island also said “appropriate forces” have been dispatched. (Xinhua, agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 National and regional flags are being flown at half mast at key facilities across the country as the nation mourns the death last Tuesday of Wu Bangguo, former chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu, who passed away at the age of 84, is to be cremated in the capital Beijing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flags at Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People, other government buildings, ports and facilities across the country – including in Hong Kong and Macau – as well as Chinese embassies and consulates, were flown at half-mast to mourn his passing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have praised Wu in an obituary, calling him “an excellent Party member, a time-tested and loyal communist soldier and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman and leader of the Party and the state.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials responsible for Macau affairs on Sunday offered their congratulations to the SAR's former top judge, Sam Hou-fai, on winning the Chief Executive race.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sam took 394 out of 400 votes from the Election Committee, with four blank votes and two members absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the result indicates that the Macau society widely recognises Sam's character, vision, ability and style.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The election process and result...are significant in the full implementation of the principle of 'patriots governing Macau', and further pushing forward the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems principle with Macau characteristics," the office said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's Liaison Office in Macau, meanwhile, noted that this was the first CE poll since amendments were made to the electoral laws in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  It described the election as open, fair, impartial, legal, smooth and orderly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee, also congratulated Sam for his victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described the two SARs as core cities in the Greater Bay Area that serve as engines for regional development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have every confidence in working closely with Mr Sam in the future to achieve complementarity and mutual benefits for Hong Kong and [Macau], giving full play to the cities' strengths to serve the country's needs," Lee said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai on Sunday won the SAR's Chief Executive election, receiving all but six votes from a 400-strong election committee.
 <br>
  <br>
  Electoral authorities said there were four blank ballots cast, with no invalid votes. Two members were absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam, 62, is from Zhongshan in Guangdong, making him the first Macau leader born in mainland China. He graduated from Peking University's law school and moved to Macau in 1986.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE-elect described the victory as the highest honour of his life, saying he's humbled and excited. He added that he’s fully prepared to devote himself to serving the city that he "deeply loves".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, Macau is welcoming the best period for development. Let's grasp the opportunities and meet the challenges, work hard together and reform. We strive for development and prosperity, and build our homes in a better way together," Sam said in his acceptance speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We contribute Macau's power for our national rejuvenation and the building of a strong nation... I stand here today, full of emotions. Because my life's path has always shared the same fate with the country, and Macau."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam added that he will unswervingly uphold One Country, Two Systems; and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests to promote a diversified economic development.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE-elect, who's due to take office in December, had served as the chief judge at Macau's top court since the SAR was established in 1999. He resigned in August this year to run in the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, announced in August that he wasn't seeking another term because his health "hadn't fully recovered".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry said on Saturday that talks in Brussels over the European Union's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles have ended with "major differences" remaining.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last Friday, Brussels voted to impose additional new tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Representatives from Beijing and the 27-member bloc have held eight rounds of talks over the issue in Brussels since September 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are still major differences between the two sides," a ministry statement said, adding that it has invited EU negotiators for further discussions in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Negotiators "made important progress in some areas," the statement said, but "have not reached a solution acceptable to both sides".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is hoped that the EU can meet China halfway, arrange to come to China as soon as possible, and accelerate the consultations with a constructive attitude, so as to reach a proper solution as soon as possible," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China slapped provisional tariffs on EU-made brandy, alarming French producers. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the Wuhan Open final for the third time.
 <br>
  <br>
  A champion in Wuhan in 2018 and 2019, Sabalenka improved her perfect record in the tournament to 16-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, who was on a nine-match winning streak on the back of her title run in Beijing last week, played a perfect first set but committed a whopping 21 double-faults during a semi-final lasting two hours, 26 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka has now won 19 of her last 20 matches, a stretch that includes titles in Cincinnati and at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The atmosphere was incredible," said Sabalenka, who was 2-4 down in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It definitely felt like one of the biggest matches of my career because the crowd made it feel like it was a Grand Slam final."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka struggled on serve early on and couldn't control her forehand as a clinical Gauff leapt to a double-break 5-0 lead inside 19 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American dropped a mere two points behind her first serve and limited the Belarusian to just two winners throughout that opening frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the first set was a rout, the second was a dogfight with six of the first eight games going against serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 78 minutes of play, Sabalenka found herself in the lead for the first time in the match, inching ahead 5-4 to up the pressure on Gauff, whose serve abandoned her when she needed it most.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Gauff's double-fault count rising, Sabalenka took full advantage and broke serve to level the contest and force a decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  A marathon third game that witnessed seven deuces and three break points saw Sabalenka win a seventh consecutive game and hold for a 3-0 lead in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Gauff's best retaliatory efforts to level for 4-4 Sabalenka held on to close out a gritty victory. (AFP)

 World number one Jannik Sinner reached the final of the Shanghai Masters after convincingly defeating the Czech Republic's Tomas Machac 6-4, 7-5 on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner will take on Novak Djokovic in the final, who fought through a knee problem to defeat Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) in an "incredible fight" on Saturday, setting up a blockbuster Shanghai Masters showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33rd-ranked Machac was looking to repeat his giant-slaying of Thursday, when he knocked out world number two Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-final got off to an electric start when the Czech broke Sinner in the first game.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the two-time Grand Slam champion kept his cool to break back in the fourth, then claimed the tenth game to clinch the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second set neither was able to break serve until the 12th game, when the Italian hit a winner to book his place in Sunday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was very tough... he is playing with so much confidence and he can hit a ball really hard, and is serving very well," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to stay there mentally... I'm very happy about how I'm fighting at the moment." (AFP)

 The annual return rate of the pension funds entrusted for investment by local governments in China has reached 5 percent since the end of 2016, according to a report released on Saturday by the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF).
 <br>
  <br>
  The local pension fund is part of the basic pension fund. The central government started market operation of the basic pension fund in December 2016, with the aim of preserving and increasing its value.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, the local pension funds managed by the NCSSF have earned an investment income of 306.67 billion yuan, achieving an average annual investment return rate of 5 percent, according to the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, investment income of the local pension funds amounted to 39.58 billion yuan, with an investment return rate of 2.42 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report went on to say that the total assets of the basic pension funds had reached over 2.23 trillion yuan by the end of 2023. (CCTV)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's finance minister said on Saturday that the country would "significantly increase" government debt issuance to offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks' capital as it pushes to lift economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commercial banks are also moving separately to ease the burden on homeowners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without providing details on the size of the fiscal stimulus being prepared, Finance Minister Lan Foan told a news briefing in Beijing that there will be more "counter-cyclical measures" this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is still relatively big room for China to issue debt,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lan noted that local governments still have a combined 2.3 trillion yuan to spend in the last three months of this year, including debt quotas and unused funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local governments will be allowed to repurchase unused land from property developers, Lan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, China's major national commercial banks unveiled detailed measures to adjust interest rates for outstanding mortgage loans in line with the central bank's policies to stabilize the property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major lenders - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank - said the adjustment would take effect from October 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said the mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more will be reduced to 30 basis points below the loan prime rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China last month asked commercial banks to lower interest rates for outstanding mortgage loans as the country aims to ease property owners' financial burdens. (Xinhua, Reuters)
