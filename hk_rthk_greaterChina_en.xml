 Search and rescue teams from Hong Kong and the mainland returned to Beijing on Wednesday afternoon after completing their missions in quake-hit Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The teams boarded four Chinese Air Force planes at the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw and arrived in Beijing at about 4pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management held a welcoming ceremony at the Beijing Capital International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, Secretary for Security Chris Tang and the Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung were also present at the ceremony.
  <br>

    Small parcels tariff triples in Trump escalation

<img alt="Small parcels sent from Hong Kong after May 2 and before June 1 will be subject to a US$75 levy and US$150 after that. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799614_2_20250409164405.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US tariff on small goods parcels sent from mainland China and Hong Kong has been tripled in the latest escalation by US President Donald Trump of the ongoing trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duty on small parcels, previously exempt from duties as part of the de diminis rule, will be increased to US$75 from the US$25 that Trump had set as part of his original opening salvo in the trade war on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US$75 duty will take effect on parcels sent from May 2 and before June 1, which was the period when the original US$25 levy was to come into play. That US$25 levy was originally set to be increased to US$50 after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  An amendment to the so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Wednesday Hong Kong time said the new rate on packages priced up to US$800 will be 90 percent of their value, up from the original 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the amendment, the per postal item fee will also be tripled to US$150 from the planned US$50 that was to go into effect after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff came into play as Trump made good on his punitive measure against China after it had reciprocated his 34 percent tariffs by a similar quantum.
  <br>
  <br>
  That brought his latest tariffs to 84 percent, making the total, on top of the 20 percent in levies imposed in February and March, 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The punitive tariffs come as around 60 percent of all de minimis packages entering the United States come from China.

 China said on Wednesday it is verifying reports of Chinese nationals being captured in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a regular briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian also urged its citizens to avoid conflict zones and participating in wars, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had captured two Chinese citizens fighting alongside Russian forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese side is verifying relevant information with the Ukrainian side," Lin said.

    'China has firm will to take countermeasures'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures and fight till the end if the United States insists on further escalating economic and trade restrictive measures, with firm will and abundant means.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that there is no winner in a trade war, and China does not want a trade war, but the Chinese government will by no means sit by when the legitimate rights and interests of its people are being hurt and deprived," an official with the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also said Beijing hopes Washington will immediately remove its unilateral imposition of tariffs, and work with China to strengthen dialogue, manage differences and promote cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the guise of pursuing "reciprocity" and "fairness," the US is engaging in zero-sum games and, in essence, seeking "America First" and "American exceptionalism," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the US is also deliberately severing the well-established global industrial and supply chains and breaking the market-oriented free trade rules, the official said these practices seriously interrupt the economic development of countries around the globe and affect the long-term stable growth of the world economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that "the Chinese people's legitimate right to development is inalienable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's sovereignty, security and development interests are inviolable," he said. "We will continue to take firm and forceful measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests." (Xinhua & agencies)

  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Malaysia announced on Wednesday that it will host President Xi for a three-day visit next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Malaysia will receive a state visit by President Xi Jinping from April 15 to 17," the country’s communications minister Fahmi Fadzil said. (Additional reporting by Reuters and AFP)

    China-US trade ties mutually beneficial: white paper

<img alt="The white paper says the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799602_1_20250409154105.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, and cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation harms both, said a white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maintaining the stable development of China-US economic and trade relations is in the fundamental interest of both nations and peoples, which is also conducive to global economic development, according to the white paper titled "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-US Economic and Trade Relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the white paper came on the same day steep US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, Beijing and Washington can resolve differences in economic and trade areas through equal-footed dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal-footed dialogue should constitute the fundamental approach in addressing problems between major countries, the white paper said, adding that mutually beneficial cooperation can help the two countries realise their respective development goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The white paper noted the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will damage its own and others' interests, and is a severe violation of World Trade Organization rules that damages the multilateral trading system and erodes the legitimate rights and interests of the parties affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the United States, weaken its industrial base, aggravate panic in the financial market and increase the risk of US economic recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "History has repeatedly taught the lesson that trade protectionism will not help strengthen a country's domestic economy," the white paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it will do severe damage to world trade and investment, which could trigger a global economic and financial crisis, with the inevitable consequences for oneself and others." (Reporting by Xinhua)

    Trump's sweeping global tariffs take effect

<img alt="White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal over tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799523_1_20250409074554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

 China is ready to fight till the end if the United States is bent on waging a tariff war or trade war, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the US threat of an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese imports, spokesman Lin Jian said the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and the rules of the World Trade Organization, seriously damages the rule-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impacts the stability of the global economic order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is typical unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying, and has been widely opposed by the international community," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that pressuring, threatening and blackmailing are not the right ways to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its lawful rights and interests," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States ignores the interests of the two countries and the international community and insists on fighting tariff wars and trade wars, China will surely fight till the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Premier Li Qiang said China's macroeconomic policies this year have fully taken into account various uncertainties and it has sufficient policy tools in reserve, adding that Beijing was "fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Li made the comments in a phone call with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who urged Beijing to ensure a negotiated solution to problems caused by the sweeping US import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier added that China's countermeasures are aimed not only at safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interest, but also at defending global trade rules and international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China will continue its opening-up policies and step up cooperation with other countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against Trump's tariffs on Friday with extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods, adding to the 10 to 15 percent tariffs it had imposed on US agricultural goods in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combined rate threatens to all but end the agricultural trade between the two countries. (Reuters)

    Vance slammed over impolite 'Chinese peasants' remarks

<img alt="J D Vance made the offensive remarks in defence of Donald Trump's tariffs move on television. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799420_1_20250408150703.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as "ignorant and impolite", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from "Chinese peasants".
 <br>
  <br>
  "China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a "globalist economy" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture," the vice president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the United States, rather than making goods abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most economists question that and say his tariffs are arbitrary. (AFP)

    Any Trump bid to weaken greenback 'set to fail'

<img alt="Donald Trump will find it extremely hard to get China and Europe to consent to a devaluation for the greenback after antagonising them with his tariffs' move. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799408_1_20250408135600.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

    World Expo hit with methane risk ahead of opening

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A level of methane high enough to potentially ignite a fire was detected at the World Expo site in Japan, organisers said on Monday, less than a week before the event opens.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas was detected at an underground pit for electrical equipment during a test opening of the venue, said the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers in the western city of Osaka barred people from coming near the affected area for about an hour to ventilate it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The site of Expo 2025, which opens on Sunday, was once a landfill. Discarded household waste creates large amounts of methane when it decomposes if left to rot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although organisers have previously taken steps to prevent the gas from being trapped, they vowed on Monday to increase the frequency of monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fence will be installed so that visitors will not come near the affected area, while ventilation will also be improved, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, a restroom at the venue under construction caught fire after a spark from welding work triggered an explosion due to methane trapped there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expo 2025 will run for six months, involving around 160 countries and regions for a display of their technological and cultural prowess. (AFP)

    US tariffs 'amount to unilateralism and bullying'

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday accused the US of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying with tariffs, while calling on representatives of American companies including Tesla to “take concrete actions” to resolve the tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putting “America First” over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US is seeking hegemony in the name of reciprocity, sacrificing the legitimate interests of all countries to serve its own selfish interests, and prioritising the US over international rules," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is typical unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The abuse of tariffs by the United States is tantamount to depriving countries, especially those in the Global South, of their right to development," Lin added, citing a widening gap between the rich and poor in each country, and less developed countries suffering a greater impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all countries should uphold consultation, joint construction and sharing, and "genuine multilateralism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged countries to jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and safeguard the international system and the multilateral trading system according to the United Nations and World Trade Organization values respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods as part of “Liberation Day,” coming on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and other governments retaliated quickly. Beijing announced its own 34 percent tariff rate on US goods, mirroring Trump's tariff rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sky won’t fall,” the People's Daily said, even if the US tariffs have an impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of US taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Saturday "the market has spoken" in rejecting US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and called on Washington for "equal-footed consultation" after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency also published the central government's stance, saying the US should "stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has spoken," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday. He also posted a picture capturing Friday's falls on US stock markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump introduced additional 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets plummeted following China's retaliation and Trump's comments on Friday that he would not change course, extending sharp losses that followed Trump's initial tariff announcement earlier in the week and marking the biggest losses since the pandemic. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for the US to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation," Guo wrote in English on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement published by the Xinhua news agency, the central government urged the US: "Stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests," said the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington "seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously undermines the stability of the global economic order," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, several industry chambers of commerce ranging from those representing traders in metals and textiles to electronics, issued statements condemning the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's chamber of commerce, representing traders in food products, called on "China's food and agricultural products import and export industry to unite and strengthen cooperation to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States, as a countermeasure to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. That was on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Commerce, meanwhile, said China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), following the US slapping of what it called "reciprocal tariffs" on its trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said the move by the US seriously violated WTO rules and damaged the legitimate rights of WTO members, slamming the US for endangering the stability of the global economic and trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also said it had decided to add 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list, with immediate effect, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced controls on the export of seven rare earths, with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the nation's General Administration of Customs announced the suspension of import qualifications for six US companies. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China urged the United States to correct its wrongful imposition of reciprocal tariffs and address economic and trade differences with China and other countries through negotiations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guo made the remarks at a regular press briefing on Thursday in response to a query about Washington's announcement of reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said additional US tariffs on exports from China and other countries seriously violate World Trade Organization regulations and severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese side firmly opposes this and will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," Guo said, adding there's no winner in a trade or tariff war.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Including the 20 percent duty imposed earlier this year, the total levies for China stand at 54 percent. (Reporting from Xinhua)

    'Not the season' as MH370 search suspended
   </title>

<img alt="Relatives of the missing MH370 passengers gather in Beijing last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight’s disappearance. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798795_1_20250403145825.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been suspended as it is "not the season", the country's transport minister said, more than a decade after the plane went missing.
 <br>
  <br>
  "They have stopped the operation for the time being, they will resume the search at the end of this year," Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a voice recording.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, it's not the season," Loke said in the recording, which was made during an event at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the largest search in aviation history, the plane has not been found.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke's comments come a little over a month after authorities said the search had resumed, following earlier failed attempts that covered vast swathes of the Indian Ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  An initial Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres in the Indian Ocean over three years, but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018, before agreeing to launch a new search this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not it will be found will be subject to the search, nobody can anticipate," Loke said, referring to the wreckage of the plane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loke said in December that a new 15,000 square kilometre area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The most recent mission was conducted on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others were from Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>
  Family members of Chinese passengers gathered in Beijing outside government offices and the Malaysian embassy last month on the 11th anniversary of the flight's disappearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some held placards asking, "When will the 11 years of waiting and torment end?" (AFP)

    Chinese rescuers fill vacuum US cuts leave in Myanmar

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 After a 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Myanmar on Friday, killing more than 2,800 people, international rescuers rushed into the devastated Southeast Asian country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The most ubiquitous among them have been Chinese relief workers, whose blue and orange uniforms appear across videos circulating on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  The posts are often accompanied with expressions of gratitude toward Beijing, whose first responders – as well as their Indian and Russian colleagues – have pulled dazed survivors and bodies out from the rubble of hotels, schools, and monasteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  America's chief geopolitical rival has so far pledged to deliver 100 million yuan worth of supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first batch of aid, including tents, blankets and first aid kits arrived in Yangon on Monday, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, which was until recently the world's top humanitarian donor, has offered a relatively modest US$2 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington also said it would send a three-member assessment team, though their arrival has been delayed by problems obtaining visas from the military regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  In past years, when tsunamis, earthquakes and other disasters struck around the world, the United States had regularly and rapidly deployed skilled rescue workers to save lives.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American absence shows how President Donald Trump's moves to slash the size of the US government has hobbled its ability to act during disasters, three current and former US officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Trump's blessings, billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has enacted huge funding cuts and contractor terminations across the federal bureaucracy in the name of targeting wasteful spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also moved to fire nearly all US Agency for International Development staff, who oversee Washington's disaster response efforts overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A functional USAID would have activated urban search-and-rescue teams that were capable of being deployed to Myanmar in 48 hours, said Marcia Wong, formerly a top humanitarian official at USAID.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party partners have lost contracts, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former US ambassador to Myanmar Scot Marciel said that while it was unlikely the junta would have allowed big US military teams to enter, Washington could still have "responded more quickly and robustly" were it not for the cuts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Thursday said it "firmly opposes" sweeping new US tariffs on its exports, vowing "countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests".
 <br>
  <br>
  US tariffs "do not comply with international trade rules and seriously harm the legitimate rights and interests of the relevant parties", the Commerce Ministry said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It called for Washington to "immediately cancel" sweeping new tariffs, warning they "endanger global economic development" and would hurt US interests and international supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to immediately cancel unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with trade partners through equal dialogue," the ministry said, adding: "There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many trading partners have expressed strong dissatisfaction and clear opposition," the ministry added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday slapped a 34 percent tariff on goods from China. That's on top of the existing tax of 20 percent. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Wednesday reposted an article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper voicing opposition to CK Hutchison's plans to sell dozens of ports, including strategic assets along the Panama Canal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article said CK Hutchison is an important Hong Kong-based firm, and it should bear its basic responsibilities and fix its mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The piece included views from various political and business leaders, including vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former chief executive CY Leung who said national interests are most important.
  <br>
  <br>
  He questioned if the US government would give the green light if China wants to buy US chip enterprises and the firms are willing to sell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing officials in charge of SAR affairs have reposted a number of commentaries at the Ta Kung Pao newspaper, criticising the proposed sale to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue teams from the SAR and the mainland have joined hands in finding a survivor in the quake-rattled Myanmar city of Mandalay.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old man had been trapped in the rubble of a hotel for more than 120 hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The joint rescue came five days after the earthquake, beyond what is typically considered the critical "golden" period for finding survivors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The man was found in stable condition and has been transferred to local medical facilities for treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks the ninth survivor rescued by the national team since their deployment to Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, security minister Chris Tang expressed gratitude to members of both the national and SAR squads.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy chief fire officer Cheu Yu-kok, who led the 51-strong SAR team, said they spared no effort in the search and rescue work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team will grasp every opportunity, never give up and do its best to find the remaining survivors," he said.

 Visitor numbers to the Tibet region reached 63 million last year, its highest ever.
 <br>
  <br>
  Travel agencies in Hong Kong, meanwhile, said more people from the SAR have visited Tibet since the launch of a direct flight in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Potala Palace in Lhasa is considered a must-see attraction by many travellers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in an interview with RTHK, Kunga Tashi, deputy director at the palace's management office, said the number of tourists has increased notably after the pandemic, rising by up to 30 percent each year over the past two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said there are moves to limit the number of visitors, to ensure better tourism experience and protect the landmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we look at 2024, the number of trips was about 2.01 million. We have set restrictions on the visitor headcount to the palace, capped at 7,000 each day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of visits by Hong Kong travellers to Tibet is on the rise after a direct flight service between the SAR and Lhasa was launched in late February.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after Beijing announced the expansion of the Individual Visit Scheme last year to allow residents from Lhasa to visit the SAR on a solo basis, instead of being part of a tour group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some SAR agencies told RTHK more people have expressed interest in heading to Tibet since the launch of the direct flight, and group tours have been fully booked through May.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hong Kong visitor travelling to Lhasa told RTHK that she enjoyed visiting the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have just arrived from the Nyingchi area... I think Lhasa is a must-visit city if you travel to Tibet," she said.

 China strongly urges all parties in Myanmar to ensure the safety of earthquake relief workers and supplies from China and other countries, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In response to a query at a daily press briefing, Guo Jiakun said relief supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China have arrived in Myanmar and are on their way to the disaster-stricken area of Mandalay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, relief workers and supplies are safe," Guo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after Myanmar's junta said earlier in the day that its troops had fired warning shots when a Chinese Red Cross convoy failed to stop while approaching a conflict area to deliver aid to earthquake victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group of nine vehicles was approaching Ommati village in northern Shan State on Tuesday night, and failed to stop when signalled by soldiers, junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a distance of around 200 metres, security forces used a light to try to halt them but they did not stop," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The security forces fired three gunshots aiming at the sky."
  <br>
  <br>
  International aid and rescue workers have been coming in to Myanmar, including from its close ally China, since Friday's 7.7-magnitude quake, which has killed close to 2,800 people and left thousands homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  But access to the worst-hit areas has been hindered by wrecked roads, poor telecommunications and ongoing violence between the junta and rebel militias.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaw Min Tun said the convoy belonged to the Chinese Red Cross and that the junta was investigating the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shan state has been the scene of intense fighting between the junta and ethnic minority armed groups which have seized control of large areas of territory. (AFP/Xinhua)

 China on Wednesday warned the Philippines against threatening "regional peace" after the United States said it had approved the possible sale of US$5.58 billion in F-16 fighter jets to Manila.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The Philippines' defence and security cooperation with other countries should not target any third party or harm the interests of a third party," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nor should it threaten regional peace and security or exacerbate regional tensions."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department said it was green-lighting a sale that includes 20 F-16 jets and related equipment to the Philippines, a treaty-bound ally of the United States. (AFP)

 Chinese electric vehicle battery giant CATL said on Wednesday that it will partner with state-owned oil giant Sinopec to build 10,000 battery swap stations.
 <br>
  <br>
  As part of a strategic deal signed in Beijing, the two companies will build at least 500 battery swap stations this year, according to a company statement, which did not give a timeline to set up these stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership will be based on CATL's "choco-swap" battery swapping and Qiji chassis battery-swapping solution to "break through the driving range bottlenecks of passenger vehicles and heavy-duty trucks," the company said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's embassy in Bangkok called on the country's companies operating abroad to comply with local laws after a Chinese construction firm came under scrutiny over a deadly building collapse in Friday's earthquake.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-storey skyscraper, set to house Thai government offices, collapsed in Bangkok when a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck neighbouring Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to investigate where the mistake happened," said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who has ordered a probe into the materials used at the construction site and its safety standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened from the beginning since it was designed?" she said earlier. "How was this design approved? This was not the first building in the country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The development near Bangkok's popular Chatuchak market was a joint project involving China Railway No 10 Engineering Group (Thailand), an offshoot of China Railway Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in Thailand late on Tuesday expressed "deepest condolences" for the collapse and urged firms to "strictly" comply with Thai laws.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese government has consistently urged Chinese companies overseas to abide by local laws and contribute positively to the society," it said in a Facebook post only in Thai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has dispatched a team of rescue experts and disaster relief personnel to assist in Bangkok and vowed to "continue supporting Thailand as needed", it added. (AFP)

    Beijing puts store in EVs for shoring up power grids

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China plans to launch pilot projects in nine cities that would use the country's growing fleet of electric vehicles as batteries to shore up power supply on the grid during spikes in demand, according to a government announcement on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move follows on rules issued last year by state planner the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to strengthen the integration of new energy vehicles with the grid amid concerns the rapid adoption of EVs would overwhelm the generation and transmission systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the 30 projects in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are vehicle-to-grid or V2G, according to the announcement by the NDRC and energy regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cars would act as batteries, storing power and sending it back into the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grid-connected cars could also adjust their charging times to avoid peak periods and provide critical services such as frequency regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Providing those services could potentially become an alternative revenue stream for homeowners or operators of charging stations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the notice, power grid companies are responsible for setting up the pilots, and provincial governments should lead the development of charging facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The energy regulator is tasked with supporting the participation of grid-connected vehicle applications in power trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year, NDRC said it would set up over 50 pilot programmes by 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, industry experts say there are a range of hurdles to overcome before the large-scale adoption of V2G, such as developing viable business models.
  <br>
  <br>
  NDRC also said in the 2024 rule that battery technologies need to be improved. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong has issued a stern warning against the United States for sanctioning six officials, saying such punitive actions are simply "a piece of waste paper."
 <br>
  <br>
  The US placed Dong Jingwei, the director for the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong, along with five other SAR officials on its sanctions list.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the office on Tuesday said Washington's sanctions were "nothing but a piece of waste paper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson said: "[The office] strongly condemned the actions of the United States and sternly warned that any attempt by external forces to interfere in Hong Kong's efforts to safeguard national security would be up against a brick wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington should stop its bullying tactics as soon as possible, the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said sanctions from the US would not undermine the determination of central and SAR authorities in safeguarding national security and the city's rule of law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing's liaison office, for its part, said it's only natural and necessary for the Hong Kong government to target anti-China rioters who sought to endanger national security.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Xiaomi said on Tuesday that it was actively cooperating with police after a fatal accident involving a SU7 electric vehicle on Saturday and that it had handed over driving and system data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The incident marks the first major accident involving the SU7 sedan, which Xiaomi launched last March and since December has outsold Tesla's Model 3 on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi's shares, which had risen by 34.8 percent year to date, closed down 5.5 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the Hang Seng Tech index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not disclose the number of casualties but said initial information showed the car was in the Navigate on Autopilot (NOA) intelligent-assisted driving mode before the accident and was moving at 116kmh.
  <br>
  <br>
  A driver inside the car took over and tried to slow it down but then collided with a cement pole at a speed of 97kmh, Xiaomi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The accident in Tongling in eastern Anhui province killed the driver and two passengers, Chinese financial publication Caixin reported on Tuesday citing friends of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a rundown of the data submitted to local police posted on a Weibo account of the company, Xiaomi said NOA issued a risk warning of obstacles ahead and its subsequent immediate takeover only happened seconds before the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that the car caught fire after the collision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi did not mention the fire in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi began manufacturing EVs last year with the launch of the SU7 sedan after selling smartphones, household appliances and smart gadgets for most of its 15-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has two versions of smart driving systems on its SU7 EVs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The higher-end LiDAR-mounted version, as opposed to the pure vision version, enables urban navigation features such as collision avoidance and special vehicle recognition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi said the car involved in the accident was a standard version of the SU7, which has the less-advanced smart driving technology without LiDAR. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command on Tuesday started to conduct joint exercises around Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Eastern Theater Command organised its army, navy, air and rocket forces to close in on the island from multiple directions, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Shi, these drills mainly focus on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, joint seizure of comprehensive superiority, assault on maritime and ground targets, and blockade of key areas and sea lanes to test the joint operation capabilities of the troops.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drills serve as a stern warning and forceful deterrent against "Taiwan independence" separatist forces, and are a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China's sovereignty and national unity, Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said the military exercises serve as a resolute punishment for Lai Ching-te authorities' blatant "Taiwan independence" provocations.

  "'Taiwan independence' means war, and pursuing 'Taiwan independence' means pushing the people of Taiwan into a perilous situation," Zhu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the mainland's countermeasures specifically target separatist activities advocating "Taiwan independence" and are not directed at the broader population of Taiwan. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing has warned of "strong and resolute" countermeasures against fresh sanctions imposed on six mainland and Hong Kong officials by the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong accused Washington of smearing the "One Country, Two Systems" principle and slandering the city's rule of law, democracy, freedom and human rights situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and a serious violation of the principles of international law and the basic norms governing international relations," a statement by the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said the move to impose sanctions has once again exposed Washington's "evil intentions" of undermining the SAR's prosperity and stability, as well as containing China's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will surely take strong and resolute countermeasures," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the officials sanctioned are Dong Jingwei, the director of the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong; justice chief Paul Lam; and outgoing police commissioner Raymond Siu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR police have taken lawful actions against overseas anti-China rioters, and the SAR judicial authorities have independently and impartially tried national security cases following legal procedures," the office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These acts are consistent with international law and customary practice, and are just and necessary moves to safeguard national security and Hong Kong's prosperity and stability."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese embassy in the US also condemned the sanctions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese central government resolutely supports the law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Hong Kong SAR in carrying out their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that undermine national security," the embassy said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to respect the facts, stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs and interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop smearing Hong Kong's democracy and rule of law."

<img alt="Wang Yi gave a wide-ranging interview to the Russian RIA state news agency, on his visit to Moscow. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798386_1_20250401092729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A peace agreement on ending the conflict in Ukraine should be fair, binding and acceptable to all parties involved, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in remarks published on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We advocate eradicating the causes of the crisis through dialogue and negotiations, ultimately achieving a fair, long-term, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties involved, which would make it possible to achieve truly lasting peace and stability in Eurasia and throughout the world," Wang told the Russian RIA state news agency in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang is on a three-day visit to Moscow for strategic cooperation talks, surrounded by uncertainty around the partial ceasefire in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump striking a critical tone against the Russian and Ukrainian leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  China calls for the peace talks to continue, Wang told RIA in a wide-ranging interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The step towards peace, although not that big, is constructive - it's worth building on it," Wang said. "With peace, it is no pain no gain. You need to work hard to achieve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Russia and the United States had taken the first step toward normalising relations, "which is good for stabilising the balance of power between major powers and inspires optimism in a disappointing international situation".
  <br>
  <br>
  China and Russia declared a "no limits" strategic partnership days before Russian President Vladimir Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kremlin said on Monday that Putin would receive Wang, who would also hold talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang reiterated to RIA that Beijing is ready to play a role in settling the conflict in Ukraine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is ready, taking into account the aspirations of the parties involved, to play a constructive role in the settlement together with the international community, primarily with the countries of the Global South," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi has been pushing for a greater involvement of China in peace talks since the early days of the war, which marked its third anniversary in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has proposed on its own, and together with Brazil, general principles to end the conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Russia and China bear a special responsibility to maintain world peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our countries, as each other's largest neighbouring states, world powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear a special responsibility for maintaining peace and development throughout the world," Wang said. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday reaffirmed its resolute opposition to moves that infringe upon and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonic practices or bullying.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun made the remarks in response to a media query related to CK Hutchison's planned sale of certain port assets to a BlackRock-led group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have taken note of relevant reports," Guo said at a regular press briefing, adding that "the State Administration for Market Regulation is aware of the deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guo emphasised that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion and bullying to infringe upon and undermine the legitimate rights and interests of other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has reposted another article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the proposed sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  The article quoted Hong Kong business and political figures as saying deals like this may involve national interests, and CK Hutchison should consider how its decision would impact the SAR and the country. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 Rescuers from China have found six survivors so far in earthquake-rattled Myanmar.
 <br>
  <br>
  The China Search and Rescue Team plucked to safety three women and a girl on Monday morning in Mandalay. One of the women is pregnant.
  <br>
  <br>
  That raised to six the number of survivors found by Chinese rescuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  A total of 91 personnel from five civilian emergency response forces organised by the Ministry of Emergency Management have arrived in Myanmar and have been taking part in rescue operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the first batch of disaster-relief material offered by Beijing arrived in Myanmar on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said one Chinese national was killed and 15 other Chinese citizens were injured in Friday's tremor.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy said the Chinese diplomatic missions in Myanmar have been assisting the families of the victims.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 1,700 people were killed in the quake. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

    China discovers major oilfield in South China Sea

<img alt="CNOOC says the new oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798194_1_20250331091600.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has discovered an oilfield in the South China Sea with proven reserves exceeding 100 million tonnes, Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newly-found Huizhou 19-6 oilfield is around 170 km off the coast of Shenzhen and sits at an average water depth of 100 metres, the report said, adding that test drilling has yielded a daily production of 413 barrels of crude oil and 68,000 cubic metres of natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huizhou 19-6 is China's first large-scale integrated clastic oilfield in the deep to ultra-deep layers, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to CNOOC, offshore oil and gas exploration in deep to ultra-deep layers face multiple challenges, including high temperatures, high pressures, and complex conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, clastic reservoirs, an important component of deep-sea hydrocarbon deposits, generally have low permeability, making the identification of large oil and gas fields more difficult.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng Guangrong, a geologist at CNOOC's Shenzhen branch, noted that 60 percent of the world's newly-discovered oil and gas reserves have come from deep layers. With abundant resources and a low level of exploration, deep to ultra-deep layers are expected to drive future growth in oil and gas reserves and production.
  <br>
  <br>
  CNOOC's CEO says China's oil and gas exploration in the eastern South China Sea has seen consecutive breakthroughs, with oilfields exceeding 100 million tonnes in reserves discovered for two straight years. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says the SAR government has earmarked HK$30 million from the Disaster Relief Fund to help victims of the severe earthquake that struck central Myanmar on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Lee said the government was in close contact with rescue groups to provide swift relief assistance to affected communities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee will promptly process related funding applications from organisations," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that officials are coordinating with Myanmar's Consul-General in Hong Kong to collect and deliver necessary relief supplies.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 51-member SAR rescue team, including personnel from various departments and two search dogs, arrived in Yangon on Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team, carrying nine tonnes of relief supplies, will drive for 10 hours to the affected area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of dead in Myanmar and Thailand stood at nearly 1,700, while thousands were hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 200 people were unaccounted for in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among those injured were 13 Chinese nationals in Myanmar, according to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embassy also said as of Sunday morning, it had received and handled hundreds of requests for help from Chinese citizens and assisted dozens of people in finding their missing relatives and friends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, rescuers from Myanmar and Yunnan province joined hands in plucking to safety an elderly man who had been trapped for nearly 40 hours under the rubble in the capital, Naypyitaw.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first survivor rescued by the 37-member Chinese team that arrived at the quake-hit area on Saturday. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 President Xi Jinping on Friday urged a gathering of multinational CEOs to protect global industry and supply chains, amid threats of more US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We need to work together to maintain the stability of global industry and supply chains, which is an important guarantee for the healthy development of the world economy," Xi told the business leaders, who included the bosses of AstraZeneca, FedEx, Saudi Aramco, Standard Chartered and Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope everyone can take a broad perspective, not be swayed by transient distractions in the industry, and not blindly follow actions that disrupt the security and stability of global industry and supply chains."
  <br>
  <br>
  Without referring directly to US tariffs, Xi also warned that "unilateralism and protectionism" were on the rise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Multilateralism is the inevitable choice for addressing the difficulties and challenges facing the world, and economic globalisation is an unstoppable historical trend," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 40 executives joined the meeting, the majority of whom represented the pharmaceuticals sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executives sat in a horseshoe formation, with Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Kallenius and FedEx's Raj Subramaniam sitting directly across from Xi. HSBC CEO Georges Elhedery, SK Hynix boss Kwak Noh-jung, Saudi Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser, and chair of Hitachi Toshiaki Higashihara also sat in the first row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign enterprises contribute one-third of China's imports and exports, one-quarter of industrial added value and one-seventh of tax revenue, creating more than 30 million jobs," Xi noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, foreign investment in China has also been interfered with by geopolitical factors... I often say that blowing out other people's lights does not make you brighter," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The President also said foreign businesses and investment in China have driven economic growth and employment, boosted technological and managerial progress, and facilitated reform and opening up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All of this shows that foreign businesses are important participants in the Chinese modernisation drive, in the country's reform and opening up and innovation, and in its interconnectivity with the world and integration into economic globalisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this process, foreign businesses have thrived and generally enjoyed handsome returns, achieved win-win results, and forged profound friendship with the Chinese people, Xi added. (Agencies)

 The earthquake in Myanmar was felt in China's Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and caused injuries and damage to houses in the city of Ruili on the border with northern Myanmar, according to Chinese media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Videos that one outlet said it had received from a person in Ruili showed building debris littering a street and a person being wheeled on a stretcher toward an ambulance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shaking in Mangshi, a Chinese city about 100 kilometres northeast of Ruili, was so strong that people couldn’t stand, one resident told The Paper, an online media outlet. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A major hospital in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw is a "mass casualty area" after the country was rocked by a huge earthquake, an official at the facility said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rows of wounded were treated outside the emergency department of the 1,000-bed general hospital, some writhing in pain, others lying still as relatives sought to comfort them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The entrance of the emergency department at the city's main hospital pancaked onto a car.
  <br>
  <br>
  A hospital official said that "this is a mass casualty area."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another official said hundreds of injured people had arrived at the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't seen [anything] like this before," a doctor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are trying to handle the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so exhausted now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The route to the hospital was jammed with vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ambulance tried to make its way through, a paramedic shouting "cars, move aside so the ambulance can get through."
  <br>
  <br>
  The quake damaged religious shrines, sending parts and some homes toppling to the ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the National Museum in Yangon, pieces fell from the ceiling as the building began shaking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uniformed staff ran outside, some trembling and tearful, others grabbing cellphones to try to contact loved ones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Part of the former royal palace and buildings were damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the area is prone to earthquakes, it is generally sparsely populated, and most houses are low-rise structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Sagaing region just southwest of Mandalay, the 90-year-old Ava Bridge collapsed, and some sections of the highway connecting Mandalay and Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, were also damaged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Residents in Yangon rushed out of their homes when the quake struck. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths. (Agencies)

 A strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit central Myanmar on Friday, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said, buckling roads in the capital Naypyidaw and with tremors felt in China and Thailand.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bangkok police say a 30-storey building under construction for government offices collapsed when the earthquake hit around midday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medics say at least 43 workers are trapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic video circulating on social media showed the multi-storey building with a crane on top collapsing into a cloud of dust, while onlookers screamed and ran.
  <br>
  <br>
  Police said they were responding to the collapse, which happened near Bangkok’s popular Chatuchak Market, but had no immediate information on how many workers were on the site at the time of the collapse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tremor's epicentre was located 16 kilometres northwest of the city of Sagaing at a depth of 10 kilometres around 12:50 pm, the USGS said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some metro and light rail services were suspended in Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's stock exchange said on it is on "full halt."
  <br>
  <br>
  The midday temblor was followed by a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roads were buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks of ceilings fell from buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt through northern Thailand and down to the capital Bangkok, where residents ran into the streets as buildings shook.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I heard it and I was sleeping in the house, I ran as far as I could in my pyjamas out of the building," said Duangjai, a resident of the popular northern tourist city Chiang Mai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tremors were also felt in Yunnan province, according to Beijing's quake agency, which said the jolt measured 7.9 in magnitude. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met with representatives of the international business community in Beijing following last weekend's China Development Forum (CDF), Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is firmly committed to advancing reform and opening up. The door of opening up will only open wider and wider," Xi told the executives, including hedge fund boss Ray Dalio and Samsung Electronics chief Lee Jae-yong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is committed to high-quality development and accelerating green, digital and intelligent transformation, and has strong industrial supporting capacity," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Foreign enterprises in China can develop their advantages and capabilities and gain an advantage in global competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Reuters reported that the global heads of German automakers BMW and Mercedes, as well as chip giant Qualcomm were among the foreign business leaders attending the meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's gathering also followed a similar one last year, which saw the first meeting between Xi and foreign business leaders after the CDF.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's CDF saw Premier Li Qiang urge countries to open their markets and combat "rising instability and uncertainty". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At the official opening of the Boao Forum for Asia on Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang said China's economy was remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme

   </u>
  </a>
  , China strategist and former senior Hong Kong government official, Andrew Leung, on Friday told Carol Musgrave that Beijing's achievements in science and technology were key to the nation's success and the vice premier's speech aimed to highlight that point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As far as innovation is concerned, we are in the fourth and fifth industrial revolutions, with a digital global economy, connectivity, changing the way we conduct our lives, how businesses are conducted and indeed how countries trade and interact with one another, and of course China's technological innovation, particularly self-reliance, was mandated by President Xi [Jinping]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Leung also said China was overcoming the barriers to trade and technology that the United States was throwing at it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has been progressing by leaps and bounds as illustrated by China's ability to build a space station from scratch... all this shows that innovation is the way to go."

    Xi meets Bangladesh leader Yunus in Beijing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping met Bangladesh leader Muhammad Yunus in Beijing on Friday, state media reported, as Dhaka's relations with neighbouring India remains shaky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yunus took charge of Bangladesh last August after the toppling of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi after an uprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 84-year-old Nobel laureate flew to Beijing on Wednesday and met with Xi on Friday, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported, without giving further details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yunus is expected to return to Bangladesh on Saturday after holding several other high-level meetings in the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  India was the biggest benefactor of Hasina's government, and her overthrow sent cross-border relations into a tailspin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dhaka's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said on Tuesday that Bangladesh was "sending a message" with Yunus's choice to spend his first state visit in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several agreements are expected to be signed on economic and technical assistance, cultural and sports cooperation, and media collaboration between the two countries, according to the Bangladeshi administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks are also expected to touch on Bangladesh's immense population of Rohingya refugees, most of whom fled a violent military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar in 2017. (AFP)

  Venezuela, whose leftist leader Nicolas Maduro is despised by the Cuban-American Rubio, has increasingly pushed its claim to the disputed Essequibo region controlled by Guyana, and was accused this month of making an incursion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have full confidence saying it now as secretary of state – there will be consequences for adventurism. There will be consequences for aggressive action," Rubio said in Guyana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what the United States would do if Venezuela attacked ExxonMobil oil projects in Guyana, Rubio said: "It would be a very bad day -- a very bad week for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stopping short of spelling out a military response, Rubio said: "We have a big navy, and it can get almost anywhere."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maduro responded angrily to the threat, calling Rubio an "imbecile" and saying "no one threatens Venezuela."
  <br>
  <br>
  While in Guyana, Rubio signed an agreement to boost security cooperation with the country including through greater information sharing. It comes years after Guyana and the United States agreed to joint maritime patrols.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyanese President Irfaan Ali welcomed the stance of Rubio, who called Venezuela's claims "illegitimate."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased at the reassurance of the US, ensuring the safeguard of our territorial integrity and sovereignty," Ali said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Telegram, said his country did "not need nor seek conflicts, but neither will we allow foreign interests to try to rewrite the reality about our Essequibo."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Get your noses out of this dispute!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guyana, an English-speaking former British and Dutch colony where the majority of the 800,000 people still live in poverty, has for years had a long-shot movement that has sought to join the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such formal accession was not on the agenda, but Trump has made no secret of his passion for expansionism in the Western Hemisphere, even at the expense of traditional alliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Exxon has dominated the oil industry, China has made rapid inroads in Guyana with infrastructure projects including an expansion of the international airport where Rubio landed. (AFP)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot in Beijing on Thursday, vowing to deepen cooperation and strategic coordination.
 <br>
  <br>
  “China is willing to work with France to enhance dialogue across all domains and levels, transcend differences, and deepen cooperation,” Wang said, adding that both countries should “assume the responsibility of major nations” and support each other’s multilateral initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrot praised the “pragmatic cooperation” between France and China, emphasizing that amid rising global uncertainty and protectionism, “France-China relations are even more important.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He reaffirmed France’s commitment to the one-China policy, support for free trade, and opposition to decoupling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministers also discussed China-EU relations, agreeing on the need for dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang stressed that “cooperation outweighs competition, and consensus surpasses differences,” while Barrot voiced support for EU-China dialogue to resolve trade disputes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the talks, China and France issued a joint statement on climate change. (Xinhua)

    Beijing offices again question CK Hutchison ports deal

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The latest Ta Kung Pao article reposted by Beijing offices in Hong Kong said CK Hutchison's ports deal didn't make business sense. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797760_1_20250328011558.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Central government bodies in charge of Hong Kong affairs on Thursday reposted another news article criticising a controversial deal by CK Hutchison’s to sell dozens of ports – including strategic assets along the Panama Canal – to a US consortium led by investment firm BlackRock.
 <br>
  <br>
  The article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper quoted business experts who questioned whether the Li Ka-shing-owned conglomerate had gotten the best deal it could have, stressing that businesses should “stand with the nation in the face of hegemonic bullying.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The article noted that public opinions that the sale did not appear to conform to the business logic of maximising profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Not only is the valuation of the assets low, but the decision was made very quickly, without adopting the ‘highest-bidder wins principle,” the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Western media reports have also pointed out that the US consortium had gotten a bargain.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ta Kung Pao report also quoted Bai Ming, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Commerce’s International Market Research Institute, as saying the deal was done “quickly and cheaply”, noting that CK Hutchison did not launch a global bidding race to find the best deal to maximise profits as logic would dictate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also said businessmen in Hong Kong should learn from the example of firms that had faced “unreasonable suppression” from the United States and yet chose to stand with the nation and prospered with the country’s support.
  <br>
  <br>
  A member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Su Qingdong, was quoted as saying that all sectors of society expect the relevant firm to reconsider the deal from the country’s perspective, though there has not been a positive response so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the fourth Ta Kung Pao article lashing out against the sale that had been reposted by both the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and the central government’s liaison office here.

 The chairman of Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s governing council on Thursday said Hong Kong must make use of its super-connector role under One Country, Two Systems to support the nation's diplomatic efforts.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a seminar focusing on China's diplomacy in the new era, Lam Tai-fai said Western countries such as the United States are creating problems through unfair practices like sanctions and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, Lam added, Beijing continued to promote peace and cooperation through building friendships with countries. He said one of PolyU's missions is to nurture patriotic students with a global perspective.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also at the seminar was Huo Yuzhen, former Chinese ambassador to the Czech Republic and Romania.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran diplomat was involved in a Foreign Ministry initiative aimed at fostering cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European nations, such as Poland, Greece and Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  She described the initiative, which began in 2012, as a success, pointing to achievements in many areas which benefitted the people of both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Huo suggested focusing on new areas of cooperation, such as green energy, advanced technology, and artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same event, former Chinese ambassador to Georgia and Tajikistan Yue Bin spoke about the development of Sino-Russian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue described how the bond between the two neighbours has grown stronger over time, evolving into a comprehensive strategic partnership building on mutual trust.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China warned on Thursday a trade war would have "no winners" after US President Donald Trump announced 25 percent import tariffs on foreign-made cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariffs won't help Washington solve its own problems, the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China also rebuffed a suggestion from Trump that he might offer to reduce tariffs on the country to get Beijing's approval for the sale of popular social media platform TikTok.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said its position on the tariff issue is consistent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said China is willing to engage with Washington on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.
  <br>

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Innovation is driving China's economy: Ding Xuexiang

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang on Thursday said China's economy is remaking itself with the growing capacity to drive growth through innovation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to dignitaries and business leaders from around the world at the Boao Forum for Asia being held in Hainan, he said this ability has helped the nation tide over economic difficulties and lifted its medium-to-long-term growth prospects and potential.
  <br>
  <br>
  “China’s firm commitment to an innovation-driven development strategy has led to… a boost in our innovation capacity and a successful transition from old to new growth drivers,” Ding said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Today, the pursuit of high quality development has become a nationwide consensus and the drive to develop new quality productive forces and spur innovation has become a widespread trend.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that China ranks among the world's fastest growing major economies, and accounts for about 30 percent of global growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding also said the nation’s economy has a stronger outlook and that despite a surge of difficulties and challenges, the economy hit its target of five percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the vice premier and Politburo Standing Committee member called on Asian leaders attending the forum to safeguard stability in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Asia has a stabilising role and that this must be "dearly cherished".
  <br>
  <br>
  “Even as we speak, changes of the world, of our times, and of historic significance are unfolding in unprecedented ways. Our world is experiencing far greater instability and uncertainty,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We should... act as builders and guardians of regional peace and make sure Asia continues to be a land of peace and stability.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Solidarity and cooperation must be strengthened to build an Asian community with a shared future, Ding added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will meet top French diplomat Jean-Noel Barrot on Thursday for talks on topics like the war in Ukraine and trade between China and the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has said it hopes this week's visit by the French foreign minister would see the countries deepen cooperation in a world facing "turbulence and transformation".
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also said the two sides will discuss ways to "jointly resist unilateralism and the resurgence of the law of the jungle".
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris expects the talks will focus on a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, as well as the Middle East and trade tensions between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  After his meeting Wang, Barrot will then head to Shanghai, where he will on Friday inaugurate a hydrogen production plant built by the Air Liquide group and participate in a Franco-Chinese business forum. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.

 Electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman has told analysts on an earnings call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see "a substantial rise" in its market share in Britain, which is "very open" to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also sees "great opportunities" to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tuesday meeting, Wang also told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD's profits coming from overseas markets "at a certain stage".
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. (Reuters)

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday a cooperation deal between Hong Kong and Hainan will contribute to the nation further opening up on the back of the free-trade advantages from the two regions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee made the remarks as he signed a memorandum of understanding with officials from the southern island province to boost trade and economic ties between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who is attending the annual Boao Forum for Asia on Hainan, said Hong Kong has been the region's major source of foreign investment and that Hainan has also invested heavily in the SAR with the issuances of more than 13 billion yuan worth of offshore bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the cooperation deal will make use of the free-trade advantages to be found on both sides and covers five key areas – trade and investment, finance, data flow, tourism and personnel exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We very much welcome Hainan to expand the scope of recognition of Hong Kong professionals in Hainan, so as to provide more development opportunities for Hong Kong's professional services sector in the region, and to complement the advantages of Hainan's international level of its professional services, while serving the vigorous development of Hainan Free Trade Port," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee also said the cooperation deal will help the two regions to create new synergies in their supply chain expansions and explore the Asean markets together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Specifically, the deal offers support for Hong Kong firms in setting up processing factories in Hainan for premium consumer brands and also encourages Hainan to open up its finance, law, accounting, consulting, exhibition and construction sectors to professionals from the SAR.
