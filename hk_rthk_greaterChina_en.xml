<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the US Treasury Department, calling the claims "groundless".
 <br>
  <br>
  China denied the claims, with the Foreign Ministry saying Beijing "has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the US Treasury, the incident happened earlier this month, when the actor compromised a third-party cybersecurity service provider and was able to remotely access the workstations and some unclassified documents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Treasury contacted the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after it was alerted of the situation by its provider BeyondTrust, and has been working with law enforcement to ascertain the impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury systems or information," the department's spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department did not provide further details on what was affected by the breach, but said more information would be released in a supplemental report at a later date.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds," the spokesperson added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said that China's economy faced the "pressure of transformation" but could overcome this through hard work, in his annual New Year's speech broadcast to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The current economic operation faces some new situations, challenges from the uncertainty of the external environment, and pressure of transformation from old drivers of growth into new ones, but these can be overcome through hard work," he said in an address broadcast on state television.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the economy had rebounded and was on an upward trajectory, with its GDP expected to exceed US$17.8 trillion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi said the country had fostered new quality productive forces and had seen new business sectors, forms and models emerging.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's annual production of new energy vehicles topped 10 million for the first time in 2024, while the country made breakthroughs in integrated circuit, artificial intelligence, quantum communications and many other fields, Xi said in his message.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi reiterated China's commitment to promoting global governance reform and contributing to the maintenance of world peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a world of both transformation and turbulence, China, as a responsible major country, is actively promoting global governance reform and deepening solidarity and cooperation among the Global South," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said "Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one can sever our blood ties, and no one can stop the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president pledged China would unswervingly implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macau. (Xinhua/AFP)

    China manufacturing continues expansion in December

<img alt="Chinese manufacturing activity continued to expand in December, although at a slower rate than in November. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785626_1_20241231161725.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

  <br>
  "No matter how the international situation changes, China will remain steadfast in further comprehensively deepening reform and promoting world peace and development," Xi said, according to broadcaster CCTV.

    China expresses 'deep condolences' over Carter's death

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday expressed "deep condolences" following the death of former US president Jimmy Carter, who died aged 100.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He has long made important contributions to promoting the development of Sino-US relations and friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We express our deep condolences."
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter normalised American relations with Beijing as Deng Xiaoping initiated the market reforms that led to unprecedented economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same year Deng -- often credited with China's "Reform and Opening" policy which led to its transformation -- met Carter in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter did not visit China during his presidency, but he made trips either side of his time in the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former president first travelled to China as a young naval officer in 1949.
  <br>
  <br>
  He visited the country in 1981, shortly after leaving office, meeting Deng and then-premier Zhao Ziyang in Beijing in 1987 and returned to China in 1991.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carter visited again in July 1997, including several days in a small village in the eastern province of Shandong. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A prototype of the CR450 bullet train that will run at 400 kilometres per hour made its debut in Beijing on Sunday, said the country's railway operator.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Railway said the train, which has a sleek, bullet-shaped nose and resembles an arrow when viewed from the side, is capable of running at a top speed of 450 kilometres per hour during trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s tipped to become the world’s fastest commercial train when it starts operations next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said the train can essentially cut travel time from Beijing to Shanghai from the current four hours, to just 2.5 hours.

<img alt="Gao Xinyu (Left) of China shakes hand with Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil after their women's singles match at the 2025 United Cup tennis tournament in Perth, Australia. Photo: Xinhua" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785270_1_20241228094532.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in Zhuhai last month was on Friday sentenced to death.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fan Weiqiu was on trial at the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court on charges of endangering public safety by dangerous means.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court heard that Fan, 62, deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said his motives "were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society", state media said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court found Fan had decided to vent his anger over a broken marriage, personal frustrations and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce, the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan was also deprived of his political rights for life.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident in Zhuhai has been described as the worst attack in China in a decade. (Xinhua/AFP)

 China on Friday warned the United States it did not tolerate interference over Washington's comments this week on rewards offered by the Hong Kong government leading to the arrest of six national security suspects.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes this. Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and we do not tolerate interference and meddling by any external power," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters at a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The extraterritorial application of Hong Kong's national security laws is fully consistent with international law and practice."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities announced six more people living overseas were placed on the national security wanted list, offering rewards of HK$1 million each for information leading to their arrest. The US State Department called it "a form of transnational repression", adding some of those individuals were based in the US. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday launched its first Type 076 new-generation amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, in Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br>
  Named after Sichuan province, the independently-developed new vessel was put into the water at a launch-and-naming ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was given the hull number 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sichuan has a full-load displacement of over 40,000 tonnes and features a dual-island superstructure along with a full-length flight deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  It incorporates innovative electromagnetic catapult and arrestor technologies, enabling it to carry fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and amphibious equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new-generation amphibious assault ship of the People's Liberation Army Navy, it plays a key role in advancing the Navy's transformation and enhancing its combat capabilities in the far seas, according to Navy officials.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following its launch, the ship will undergo a series of planned tests, including equipment commissioning, mooring tests and sea trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Navy unveiled its inaugural 075-class amphibious assault ship, the Hainan, in Shanghai in 2019. Two more Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the Guangxi and the Anhui, have also been commissioned.  (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 National People's Congress Standing Committee member Starry Lee on Friday said she hopes the newly restored multi-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents can be extended to cover more cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR saw more mainland visitors over Christmas, which benefited the retail, catering and hospitality sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that with the close monitoring of the implementation, more and more cities in the GBA in particular can have more relaxed visa application procedures so that more people from different cities in the Guangdong area can come to Hong Kong to visit and we can exchange more," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earlier attended a standing committee meeting in Beijing where she said 10 bills were discussed and some, involving value-added tax, the Supervision Law and the Science and Technology Popularisation Law, were passed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 14th National People's Congress will open its third annual session in the capital on March 5, and Lee described 2025 as a "critical year", saying Hong Kong should play a more active role in inviting foreign investment and attracting talent.

 Hong Kong travellers will soon be able to fly on the homegrown C919 aircraft from Chek Lap Kok airport, with China Eastern Airlines assigning the narrow-body passenger jet to its daily route between the SAR and Shanghai from January 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The news was announced by the the Transport and Logistics Bureau on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a Facebook post, Secretary for Transport Mable Chan thanked the Civil Aviation Administration of China for its continued strong support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move hopefully will allow more SAR residents a chance to step on the C919 and experience the remarkable achievements of the nation's aviation development. International travellers can also know more about the technological advances of China's aviation development," the post read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By assigning the C919 to a regular route between Hong Kong and Shanghai Hongqiao airports, it reflects the importance of the SAR as a global aviation hub."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said she has already instructed the Civil Aviation Department and the Airport Authority to provide comprehensive assistance, ensure the best experience for passengers and promote the nation's aviation achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  She earlier met representatives of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMAC, and thanked the company for setting up an office in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong can provide assistance on many fronts, including aircraft maintenance, personnel training, as well as leasing and sale of aircraft," Chan wrote.

 A Macau official has died after a car accident in an industrial area of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Macau's Government Information Bureau said Chief of the Office of the Secretary for Security, Cheong Ioc-ieng, died after the crash on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A clip that circulated online showed the front of a private car engulfed in flames after a collision with a bus. The car reportedly lost control on Avenida de Venceslau de Morais.
  <br>
  <br>
  The video showed Cheong, who had been driving the car, being pulled out of the vehicle by passers-by before firefighters arrived.
  <br>
  <br>
  Firefighters said three people were injured at the scene.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheong was reported to have been taken to hospital with no signs of breathing or heartbeat. The other two injured people were passengers on the bus.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Office of the Secretary for Security expressed sadness over Cheong's death and sent condolences to her family.

    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

    China vows cooperation over severed undersea cables

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has provided information and documents to a joint investigation into two severed Baltic Sea undersea cables, and has invited Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to participate in and complete the inquiry, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning made the remarks at a news briefing when asked about a Financial Times report that Sweden had criticised China for refusing full access despite an open investigation, and for not allowing its public prosecutor to board the suspect ship, Yi Peng 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese bulk carrier is moving again after sitting still for more than a month in Danish waters, the Swedish Coastguard said on Saturday. China allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board the vessel for the investigation last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to cooperate with the investigation, the Yi Peng 3 has been suspended for a long period of time, and in order to safeguard the physical and mental health of the crew, the shipowner company has decided to resume its voyage after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with the parties concerned," Mao said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that China had notified all relevant countries in advance and was willing to maintain communication and cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yi Peng 3 came under investigation following the breach in November of two fibre-optic cables - one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania - that raised suspicions of sabotage and concerns about the security of critical infrastructure. (Reuters)

  <br>
  Footage circulating online apparently captured the dramatic moment, when the moving train – running at full speed – collided with the crane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos also showed the train suffering a substantial level of damage, with shattered glass all over the floor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai Metro said on social media that the crane had "intruded" into the track and damaged facilities on route 11 of the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said repairs are expected to take a considerable amount of time because of the complicated situation at the scene, adding that commuters should take other modes of transportation.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to mainland media, two cranes were lifting a steel frame just after 8am, when one of them suddenly snapped and hit the moving train.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Macau-based academic on Friday said the SAR should think of ways to bring people to neighbouring Hengqin Island, which is partly leased to the territory, to diversify its economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a speech at the inauguration of the new Macau government, President Xi Jinping urged authorities not to deviate from the purpose of the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The area offers support for Macau in diversifying its economy and developing four key industries: big health; innovation and technology; financial services; conventions and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Hengqin] is highly developed, but it still lacks population," City University of Macau's rector Jun Liu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we really think about Hengqin as an expanded area, as a collaboration zone, we need to have people. We need to have policies to support four areas of economic diversification, we need to retain those highly qualified graduates... On the other hand, we really need to look elsewhere for great talent from around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The professor also said the new government under Chief Executive Sam Hou-fai is expected to take forward measures and initiatives, after the previous administration had laid the groundwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, it seems that we are [in] a better position to move forward with more vision, more hands-on strategies," Liu said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday directed Macau to diversify its economy as one of his four “hopes” for its new administration, after swearing in the SAR’s new Chief Executive, Sam Hou-fai.
 <br>
  <br>
  The president expressed confidence the SAR will open up new horizons for development and keep creating new glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech marking the 25th anniversary of Macau's return to the motherland, Xi also laid out his expectations for the government to improve governance, build a high-level platform to enhance China’s connections with the international community, and safeguard social harmony and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president urged the gambling hub to cultivate new industries in alignment with China's national development strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present the overall situation in Macau is stable, but the internal and external environment is undergoing profound changes," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Efforts should be made to promote moderate economic diversification... [with a] focus on cultivating new industries with international competitiveness."
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi also highlighted the importance of Hengqin Island, which was partly leased to Macau to boost its land supply for non-gaming development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The central government decided to develop Hengqin with the goal of fostering Macau's development of a diversified economy and to facilitate the living and employment of Macau residents," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There can be no development of industries and projects that do not align with this positioning."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also highlighted the crucial role that the One Country, Two Systems model has played in ensuring the city’s success in the past 25 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's splendid achievements since its return to the motherland is proof to the world that 'One Country, Two Systems' has a clear systemic advantage and strong vitality," Xi said, adding that the framework "must be adhered to over the long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that young people in the city should continue to build on the successes of One Country, Two Systems, and urged authorities to help nurture the next generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The SAR government and all sectors in society should care more about them and help them develop, and create a better environment and conditions for them,” Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope all young people will care about Macau and the country, set lofty goals, be pragmatic, and fulfil the role of builders and successors of the cause of One Country Two Systems.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Macau has been shining like a “bright pearl” and that its people have benefitted from its economic and social development over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sense of gain, happiness and security of Macau residents have strengthened significantly,” Xi said. (Additional reporting by agencies)

 President Xi Jinping fully endorsed the work of senior Macau officials during his second day in the SAR, while also meeting Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who visited the neighbouring city on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meeting the heads of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Macau, the president said the three organs of government have "comprehensively, accurately and unwaveringly" implemented One Country, Two Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Xi said that under the leadership of Macau SAR Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng, the branches performed their duties pragmatically and effectively over the past five years," a Xinhua report read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news agency added that Xi expressed appreciation to the representatives across different sectors for contributing to Macau's long-term prosperity and stability, and called on them to "stay united and work for greater achievements".
  <br>
  <br>
  Apart from outgoing leader Ho Iat-seng and his successor Sam Hou-fai, the president also greeted former chief executives Edmund Ho and Fernando Chui.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xi received Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, who was in Macau to attend celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua, the president urged Hong Kong and Macau to "strive for greater accomplishments and achieve better development", while declaring One Country, Two Systems has entered a new stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The two special administrative regions should learn from each other, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, and create a brighter future," Xi was quoted by the news agency as saying.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV quoted Xi as telling Lee that the country has "very high expectations" for Hong Kong, and wished Lee and his administration sound and stable governance and create a brighter future.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, in response, vowed to work hard to boost Hong Kong's economy, strive for development, improve people's livelihood, proactively participate in building the Greater Bay Area, and better integrate into the national development.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called on Macau to better integrate into the country's strategic development and continue to strive for more, saying the SAR has what it takes to "fly high".
 <br>
  <br>
  Stating his three expectations on Thursday, the president urged the city to align with the motherland's developments; to gather people who safeguard One Country, Two Systems and love Macau; and to undergo reforms and innovate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Macau] must keep an eye on the overall strategies of the rejuvenation of the Chinese civilisation and changes in the world," Xi addressed a dinner reception celebrating the 25th anniversary of the SAR's establishment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should keep up with the trend of the times, further find its own positioning, plan for the future development of Macau, be more proactive in aligning with national development strategies such as the Greater Bay Area, and make greater achievements on the international stage," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president praised the outgoing Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and his administration, saying the past five years had been "extraordinary" in the city's history, navigating constant changes in the world and challenges presented by the Covid pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the strong support of the central government and the motherland, Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng and the fifth-term government have united and led all sectors of Macau to overcome difficulties, and to be pragmatic," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[They] have promoted the continued improvement of the economy, with various undertakings making comprehensive progress and writing a new chapter in the successful implementation of One Country, Two Systems with Macau characteristics."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ho, for his part, told the crowd that his administration had implemented the principle of "patriots governing Macau", safeguarded national security, promoted moderate economic diversification, improved governance, and better integrated into the nation's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The motherland is the strongest backing for Macau's prosperity and stability. The country has always regarded Macau as its 'crown jewel', cared about the well-being of compatriots, continued to introduce a series of policies and measures beneficial to Macau, and constantly provided new opportunities, space and motivation for Macau's development," Ho said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also thanked Xi and the central government for their trust and support, while giving his backing for his successor Sam Hou-fai in leading the new government and the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president and the guests were then treated to a gala show featuring musical performances, dances, acrobatics among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The congregation joined Xi in singing "Ode to the Motherland", wrapping up the hour-long event on a high note.

 President Xi Jinping visited the Macau University of Science and Technology on Thursday morning on the second day of his trip marking the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi’s motorcade arrived at the university before 10am amid tight security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president toured two state-level laboratories at the university, one in traditional Chinese medicine and the other in lunar and planetary science.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had exchanges with faculty, researchers and students, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  University president Joseph Lee quoted Xi as saying Macau could work with the mainland in areas such as Chinese medicine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Xi] believes the research for Chinese medicine should be combined with the latest biomedicine to lead the world, and that Chinese medicine will take up a very important position in the world," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the president noted the achievements of the Macau Science 1, a low-latitude satellite constellation with high-precision geomagnetic field measurements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong Chi-meng, Macau's director of education and youth development, said Xi was satisfied with the development of higher education in the SAR and praised the territory's patriotic education.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president also visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi had warm exchanges with residents living and starting businesses in the cooperation zone, and with people involved in the zone's planning, construction, management and services, according to Xinhua.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is expected to visit other places in Macau this afternoon and attend a gala dinner and a variety show in the evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also on Thursday morning, a museum near the Ruínas de São Paulo welcomed First Lady Peng Liyuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peng spent around an hour at the museum and met a group of pupils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Peng] urged the kids to study history and culture well, so that they could better understand their own place and offer help in the future," said Macau's culture chief Leong Wai-man.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will lead a delegation to Macau to attend the celebration events today.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial Secretary Paul Chan and Justice Secretary Paul Lam will be among those joining Lee on the visit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CATL said on Wednesday it had co-developed 10 new electric vehicle models with automakers that use swappable batteries, as the Chinese battery giant seeks to lead a trend it says will replace a third of petrol stations in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yang Jun, CEO of CATL's battery swapping brand Evogo, said it would roll out the first EV that uses its so-called "choco-swap" battery this month, with the remaining to be launched in upcoming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL will also look to build 1,000 battery swapping stations next year and to accelerate this further by enlisting partners to build more stations, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's largest battery maker has also been seeking to expand in new business sectors such as micro power grids and skateboard chassis, CATL's chairman Robin Zeng told Reuters in an interview in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  It launched the Evogo battery swap service in 2022, which it said would allow drivers to change EV batteries in one minute. Its automaker partners include state-owned Changan Auto and FAW and to date it has built a small number of charging stations across a few Chinese cities on a trial basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription fee for the choco-swap battery swapping service starts from 369 yuan (US$51) per month, Yang said at an event in China's southern city of Xiamen to talk about battery swapping. Zeng told the same event that the batteries would come with two standard sizes to speed up adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope, Zeng added, was that the choco-swap battery swapping stations would use as much green energy as possible and play a role in stabilising the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  China could eventually have 30,000-40,000 battery swapping stations which could replace a third of its roughly 100,000 petrol stations, Yang predicted. Zeng said that he expected battery swapping to make up a third of power-up solutions for EVs alongside home and public chargers by 2030. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has arrived in Macau for a three-day visit marking the 25th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking upon his arrival at the airport, Xi hailed Macau's development since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, the One Country, Two Systems principle with unique Macau characteristics has achieved worldwide recognition, showcasing vibrancy and unique charm," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The country's development is rapidly advancing, and its momentum cannot be stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau's vast development potential is being unleashed, and the future is promising. This is the pride of Macau residents and the pride for the entire nation."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that Macau has a bright future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe as long as [Macau] gives full play to the advantages of One Country, Two Systems and is not afraid to strive and innovate, it can definitely create a better tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Macau is a jewel in China's crown, and I always have its development and the well-being of all its residents in my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi and First Lady Peng Liyuan were greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as their plane landed at Macau International Airport on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will oversee the inauguration of the SAR's new leader, Sam Hou-fai, and other members of his governing team on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also conduct an inspection tour and attend a gala dinner and a variety performance, among other activities, during his stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is Xi's third visit to Macau as president, after 2014 and 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee will travel to the gaming hub on Thursday to take part in the anniversary events there.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhou-19 crew members aboard China's orbiting space station completed the first extravehicular activities (EVAs) of their mission at 9.57pm Beijing time on Tuesday, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
 <br>
  <br>
  Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze worked for nine hours on completing multiple tasks, including the installation of space-debris protection devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were assisted by the space station's robotic arm and a team on Earth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cai and Song, the two crew members assigned the EVA duty, have since returned safely to the Wentian lab module.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mission of the first EVAs of the Shenzhou-19 crew was a complete success, setting a new record for the duration of EVAs by Chinese astronauts, said the CMSA.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marked Cai's second EVAs in space, following his initial EVAs during the Shenzhou-14 mission two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Song became the first Chinese astronaut born after 1990 to carry out EVAs, said the agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhou-19 crew is set to carry out a slew of scheduled space-science experiments and technical tests, while they will also undertake additional EVAs and install payloads outside the space station, the agency added. (Xinhua)

    Walmart, Meituan team up to boost e-commerce sales

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart said on Tuesday it had formed a strategic partnership with Meituan, under which the Chinese firm has begun providing delivery services for Walmart goods and the US company will be featured on its popular app.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move will help Walmart accelerate its e-commerce business in China, which accounts for nearly half of its sales in the country, Walmart's China unit said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership follows Walmart's sale of a stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com for US$3.7 billion in August, allowing it to diversify beyond JD's logistics services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meituan is China's biggest food delivery company but also provides a host of other services that range from deliveries of other goods to bike-sharing and ticket booking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the company most Chinese consumers turn to when they want a quick delivery of basic household items and Walmart will become more visible by being on the Meituan app, said Jason Yu, general manager at CTR Market Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart last month reported that quarterly net sales in China, including sales from both Walmart and its members-only Sam's Club stores, surged 17 percent to US$4.9 billion. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday he hopes the incoming Trump administration would "make the right choice" and work with Beijing, hours after Donald Trump told reporters the Covid-19 pandemic had strained his relationship with "friend" President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We hope the new US administration will make the right choice and work with China in a mutually-beneficial manner to remove disruptions and overcome obstacles," the foreign minister told a forum in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the two countries can achieve "many great things" if they work together.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also warned against "crude interference" by the US on the issue of Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a very good relationship until Covid," Trump told reporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday when asked whether Xi would attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Covid didn't end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me."
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday announced a relaxation of its visa-free transit policy, extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers to 240 hours, or 10 days, from 72 to 144 hours.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move comes as the country tries to attract more visitors, boosting post-pandemic travel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Effective immediately, 21 additional ports have been designated for visa-free entry and exit, and the areas in which transit travellers can stay have been expanded, according to a statement from National Immigration Administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the updated policy, eligible citizens from 54 countries, including Russia, Brazil, Britain, the United States and Canada, can enter China visa-free when transiting to a third country or region.
  <br>
  <br>
  These travellers may now enter through any of the 60 ports across 24 provinces, regions and municipalities, and stay within the designated areas for up to 240 hours. Cross-regional travel is being introduced, allowing foreign visitors to move freely across the 24 specified provincial-level regions during their 10-day stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  China recorded nearly 29.22 million inbound foreign visits in the first 11 months of 2024, up 86.2 percent year on year. Of these, 17.45 million entered the country visa-free, more than doubling the figure from a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since reopening its borders in 2023, Beijing has waived visa requirements for travellers to encourage visitation to the world's second largest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the Foreign Ministry said China had extended its visa-free policy to a total of 38 countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

 The People's Liberation Army (PLA) will decide whether and when to conduct military exercises in accordance with its needs and the situation on the ground, a defence spokesperson said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defence, made the remarks when responding to media questions on military drills following Taiwan regional leader Lai Ching-te's recent transit through Hawaii and Guam, emphasising the PLA's unwavering resolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu reaffirmed the PLA's mission to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and defend the shared interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any attempt to split the nation through soliciting external support or resorting to force will be punished, and will never succeed," Wu said. (Xinhua)

 A memorial ceremony was held in Nanjing on Friday in honour of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mourners gathered at the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders to remember those killed by invading Japanese forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soldiers placed numerous large floral wreaths on stage, before the national anthem was played and a moment of silence held to a lowered national flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  An estimated 300,000 civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed during the six-week massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2014, China's top legislature designated December 13 as National Memorial Day, to ensure the massacre is not forgotten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Today, there are only 32 living registered survivors of the massacre.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1945, the war against Japan came to an end as Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender in the Second World War. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday said it was "deeply surprised and dissatisfied" with comments made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol that appeared to accuse Chinese nationals of espionage.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon made a defiant televised address earlier Thursday in which he defended his shock decision to declare martial law and send troops to the South Korean parliament last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The embattled leader also lashed out at China during his speech, accusing Chinese nationals of photographing and filming military sites in South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry hit back later Thursday, saying Yoon was "groundlessly hyping up so-called Chinese espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China... is deeply surprised and dissatisfied with these remarks made by the South Korean side," ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press briefing, without referring to Yoon by name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not conducive to the healthy and stable development of China-South Korea relations," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his address, Yoon accused the main opposition party of blocking his efforts to amend South Korea's anti-spying law.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said current legislation left "no way to punish foreign nationals for espionage".
  <br>
  <br>
  Mao said Thursday that Beijing "firmly opposes the South Korean side's linking internal issues with China-related factors".
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the Chinese government always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations, and added that no conclusion had been reached regarding the case mentioned by the Republic of Korea. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump has invited President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to his inauguration next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said Thursday during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the opening bell to kick off trading for the day, that he had been “thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration” without referring to any specific individuals.
  <br>
  <br>
  “And some people said, ‘Wow, that’s a little risky, isn’t it?’” Trump said. “And I said, ‘Maybe it is. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens.’ But we like to take little chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came soon after his incoming White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed during a Thursday morning appearance on “Fox & Friends” that Trump had invited Xi and other world leaders to attend his inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  No head of state has previously made an official visit to the US for the inauguration, according to State Department historical records.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unprecedented invitations come at a moment when much of the world is bracing for what comes next when Trump and his “America First” world view return to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has vowed to levy massive tariffs against the United States' chief economic competitor, China, as well as neighbours Canada and Mexico - citing illegal immigration and illegal drugs as a factor in his decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Danny Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said President Xi would not allow himself to “be reduced to the status of a mere guest celebrating the triumph of a foreign leader.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing on Thursday about Trump's invitation, spokesperson Mao Ning responded, “I have nothing to share at present.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s January 20 inauguration is set to take place a day after the US deadline for ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the United States. (AP)

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 FTU lawmaker Bill Tang on Thursday said he hopes students here can learn more about the Nanjing Massacre, so that they will cherish peace and contribute to the country’s development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The legislator paid a visit to United Christian College in Kwun Tong and spoke to around 900 students a day ahead of the 87th anniversary of the historical event.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Japanese troops captured the city of Nanjing on December 13, 1937, they killed more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers over the next six weeks in one of the most barbaric episodes of the Second World War.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to RTHK after the sharing session, Tang said the prerequisite to patriotism is a strong understanding of the country, including its history, culture, societal development, as well as economic and technological advances.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The more you learn, the more love you will feel for the country. Regardless of whether the country is thriving or facing challenges, we will always be proud of being a Chinese,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang added that he hopes students can understand why China places a strong emphasis on development and strives to “stand strong”, in face of the painful past.
  <br>
  <br>
  A form five student said she’s gained a deeper understanding of what the Chinese people had experienced in the past, while another said he’s come to appreciate the importance of peace and stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Chinese History teacher at the school, meanwhile, said the sharing session has helped students better understand the country’s past and strengthened their national identity.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has urged Hong Kong business representatives in Beijing to take a leading role in facilitating exchanges between the SAR and the capital city.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a closed-door luncheon on Thursday during Lee's duty visit, the CE met members of the Beijing-based Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in China and other business figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the chamber has all along committed to promoting exchanges in areas such as trade, culture and technology, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased that the chamber has played a leading role in facilitating the complementary advantages and the sharing of benefits in resources between Beijing and Hong Kong,” Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope that we will continue to strengthen cooperation and facilitate exchanges between the two places.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chairwoman of the chamber, Judith Yu, said the chief executive called on those attending the luncheon to assist firms in both cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  “[He mentioned] we should act as a platform to help Hong Kong companies based in Beijing to adapt to the environment, and also we should help more [SAR] companies and Beijing companies use the platform of Hong Kong to list in Hong Kong, and through Hong Kong invest overseas.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Those at the meeting told Lee to consider introducing more measures, including tax concessions, to attract high-performing mainland individuals from the technology sector to come to the SAR, Yu added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee separately met leaders from universities in Beijing that are included in the list of eligible institutions under the SAR's top talent pass scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The representatives came from Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beihang University and Beijing Institute of Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanking the universities for their continued support for the SAR, Lee said he looked forward to strengthening cooperation with the institutions and working together “to build a hub for high-calibre talent”.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who has been acting in Lee’s capacity during the annual visit, will travel to Beijing “at dusk” on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will join Lee “in meeting with relevant ministries” before returning on Saturday, the government announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE is currently on a four-day duty visit to the capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to sources, Lee is scheduled to meet central government leaders on Friday to brief them on the city’s latest economic, social and political situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also return to the SAR on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economic officials in outgoing US President Joe Biden's administration are set to meet their Chinese counterparts this week for talks, in a final effort to strengthen ties before Donald Trump's White House return.
 <br>
  <br>
  The talks come as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed in an interview on Wednesday the need for "ongoing communications at all levels" to avoid needless worsening in relations between the world's two biggest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economic and trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have continued to flare during Biden's time in office. But temperatures could rise further under Trump, who has threatened sweeping tariff increases on Chinese goods ahead of his presidency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's critical to have open channels of communication," Yellen told Bloomberg Television, warning that Trump's universal tariffs proposal would likely trigger retaliation.

  On Thursday, US Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh is due to meet Vice Minister of Finance Liao Min for an economic working group meeting on the sidelines of Group of 20 talks in South Africa, said the US Treasury Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The United States and China are the two largest economies on the globe, and the American people expect that we should be able to communicate directly with Chinese officials on both areas where we agree and especially on areas where we don't," said Shambaugh.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury officials and representatives from other agencies will travel to the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing as well, for a financial working group meeting taking place on Sunday and Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's delegation is expected to be headed by People's Bank of China deputy governor Xuan Changneng.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration plans to raise tariffs on solar wafers, polysilicon and some tungsten products from China to protect US clean energy businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The notice from the US Trade Representative’s office said tariffs on Chinese-made solar wafers and polysilicon will rise to 50 percent and duties on certain tungsten products will increase to 25 percent, effective on January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains,” US Trade Representative Katharine Tai said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Washington tightened restrictions on Chinese access to advanced semiconductor technology. Beijing responded by banning exports to the US of certain critical minerals needed to make computer chips, such as gallium, germanium and antimony. It also stepped up its controls on graphite exports to the US. (AFP/AP)

 At least one person was killed after a powerful blast rocked a residential high-rise building in the Nanshan district of Shenzhen, mainland media reported on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen Fire Brigade said it sent 16 fire trucks and 80 rescue personnel to the scene after receiving a report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing News said a preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out on the 28th floor due to a gas explosion, with the cause of the blast still under investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  One person reportedly fell off the building following the blast, according to authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports said workers at the nearby 66-storey China Resources Tower said they felt tremors after the explosion. Some companies in the building evacuated their staff to safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investigations and rescue efforts are underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Huangmaohai Sea-Crossing Passage, connecting Zhuhai and Jiangmen, officially opened on Wednesday, and it is expected the link will boost travel across the Greater Bay Area (GBA).
 <br>
  <br>
  The 31-kilometre link is the western extension of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, and starts in Pingsha Town while ending in Taishan City's Doushan Town.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project consists of two main bridges - Huangmaohai Bridge and Gaolan Port Bridge, two tunnels, four interchanges and one service area.
  <br>
  <br>
  With its commencement, the travel time between Zhuhai and Jiangmen is reduced from more than one hour to 30 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reported that some drivers from different GBA cities, including Zhuhai, Jiangmen and Macau, waited to get a glimpse of the link.
  <br>
  <br>
  Construction of the bridge began in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the world's longest three-tower cable-stayed highway design bridge.

    Tap into the mainland database for clinical trials: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's healthcare sector needs to maximise its edge on the international stage by collaborating with its mainland counterparts in clinical trials, according to the chief executive.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spelling out his vision on RTHK programme Overview Policy, John Lee reiterated the main objective of reforming the healthcare system is to ensure efficient division of work among the Hospital Authority, the Department of Health and the Primary Healthcare Commission, which was set up in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make primary healthcare accessible for everyone in the community. People need to take good care of themselves, especially before they fall ill so they don't have to rely on treatment. The basis is to have everyone protect their own health on a day-to-day basis," Lee explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another goal, the chief executive stated, is to establish Hong Kong's own drug regulator and speed up registration of new pharmaceutical products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, a drug can only be submitted for approval after it has been registered in at least two reference jurisdictions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the aim is to substitute part of that requirement with approved clinical trials, where collaboration with the mainland is essential.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have data from 7.5 million patients. But if we can utilise the data from 1.4 billion people on the mainland, or even just 78 to 80 million in the Greater Bay Area, then the clinical trials will become a lot more effective," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR leader also stressed that careful planning is needed when establishing a third medical school in the city, to make sure it does not take away students or resources with the two existing institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have only around 2.1 doctors per 1,000 people, compared to the ratio of 2.5 in other advanced economies. There's a lot of catching up to do, and with the current limited intake quota for medical students it's very important to set up a third medical school," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But at the same time I don't want these institutions to compete against each other for students. So right now the idea is to let two medical schools focus on teaching, while the third can focus on research and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee confirmed multiple universities have expressed interest to take up the initiative, and a working group is now assessing which one is the most suitable candidate and meets all of the Medical Council's requirements.

    China to impose visa curbs on US officials over HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said it would impose visa restrictions on US personnel who are deemed to have "behaved poorly" on Hong Kong-related issues.
 <br>
  <br>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Washington had grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and seriously violated principles of international law and basic norms of international relations by imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has decided to impose visa restrictions on US personnel who have behaved poorly on Hong Kong-related issues. We must emphasise that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. We urge the US side to genuinely respect China's sovereignty, Hong Kong's rule of law, and cease any form of interference in Hong Kong affairs," Mao said at a news conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington had last month said it would impose fresh sanctions on Hong Kong officials responsible for implementing the SAR's national security law following the jailing of 45 people for subversion.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that a trade war with the United States would result in "no winners", ahead of next month's inauguration of US president-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a meeting with heads of major international economic organisations in Beijing, Xi said he hopes the US will work with China to push bilateral relations towards a steady, healthy and sustainable direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff wars, trade wars and sci-tech wars go against the trend of history and the laws of economics, and there will be no winners," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president said Beijing is willing to maintain dialogue, expand cooperation and manage differences with Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico after he takes office, raising fears of a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also said China has full confidence in achieving this year's economic growth target and in continuing to play the role of the world's largest engine of economic growth.
  <br>

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top electric vehicle maker BYD gained market share as the world's largest auto market recorded its fastest-growing month in 2024, setting BYD up to exceed its global annual sales goal and overtake Ford and Honda.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has been on an extraordinary expansion this year, growing capacity and undertaking a massive hiring spree to turbocharge revenue that surpassed EV leader Tesla in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aided by robust sales in China, BYD is on course to top its annual sales target of 4 million vehicles, which would put it ahead of Japan's Honda and Detroit-based Ford for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant delivered 3.76 million vehicles in the first 11 months of this year, including 506,804 units sold in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolstered by strong sales led by a competitive lineup of models with its latest plug-in hybrid technology, BYD gained ground over rivals as China's car sales grew in November at their fastest from a year earlier since January, thanks to government-subsidised auto trade-ins.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, BYD's share of the Chinese auto market, which makes up more than 90 percent of its total sales, stood at 17.1 percent, up from 12.5 percent in 2023, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.

 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said on Sunday it hoped Syria would return "to stability as soon as possible", after rebels said they had taken Damascus and sent President Bashar al-Assad fleeing.

  Beijing "is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible", a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

  "The Chinese government has actively assisted Chinese citizens who are willing to leave Syria in a safe and orderly way, and has maintained contact with... Chinese citizens who remain in Syria," the ministry said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

 US President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he has chosen former senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China’s leaders," Trump said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Thursday imposed sanctions on 13 US military firms in response to the sale of American weapons to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move followed Beijing's strong objection to Washington authorising a potential US$385 million sale of spare parts and support for radars and F-16 fighter jets to the island.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said the move undermines its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sanctions also cover six top executives at some of the companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Foreign Ministry said the sanctioned companies would have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives would be barred from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing on Thursday also urged Washington to "stop sending the wrong signals" after US House Speaker Mike Johnson had a phone call with Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to emphasise once again that the Taiwan issue is the core of China's core interests and the first red line that may not be crossed in Sino-U.S. relations," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has condemned Washington for allowing Lai to stop over in both Hawaii and Guam during a visit to the Pacific. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spring Festival has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by the UN's culture agency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) made the decision on Wednesday, noting that the festival promotes family values, societal cohesion and peace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spring Festival, a tradition dating back thousands of years, marks the start of the new year in the Chinese calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unesco said the festival incorporates social customs to welcome the new year, seek blessings for good fortune, celebrate family reunions and promote community harmony.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice Minister of Culture and Tourism Rao Quan expressed gratitude for Unesco's recognition, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rao stressed that the Spring Festival stands as China's most important traditional festival, embodying Chinese people's aspirations for a better life and strong ties with family and the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With this addition, China now has a total of 44 items on Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, the highest number in the world.

 Workers and residents near a construction site in Shenzhen had to evacuate their homes and workplaces following a sudden ground collapse.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thirteen people remain missing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The collapse happened at 11pm on Wednesday at a construction site in the city's Bao'an District, prompting local authorities to cordon off streets hundreds of metres away from the site.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearby residents and workers were seen evacuating their homes and factories, with some saying they were asked to do so at about noon on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resident, who was leaving with her pet, said she was not sure when could she return home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They asked us not to stay here and asked us to evacuate. They think it's not safe here and asked us to move elsewhere," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  A worker said there was no arrangement of accommodation from his employer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone has to evacuate... I don't know how to describe my feelings now. I can't work and also I have to pay and live elsewhere," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another worker said he was working at a nearby site when the collapse happened.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was working and the electricity supply was suddenly cut off... We're moving out due to safety concerns, and we have to wait for further announcement from the company," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An all-out rescue has been launched and an investigation into the accident is underway, state media reported.

 The China Coast Guard (CCG) on Wednesday warned Manila to stop its infringements, provocations and actions, saying that a Philippine vessel intentionally rammed into a CCG ship around the Huangyan Dao, also known as the Scarborough Shoal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Otherwise, the Philippines will be held accountable for all consequences arising from this," CCG spokesperson Liu Dejun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the CCG said the Philippines deployed coast guard vessels, official ships and fishing boats into waters around Huangyan Dao in the South China Sea as the Chinese fleet responded in accordance with the law and regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG said that Philippine ships "came dangerously close", adding that a Philippine vessel ignored multiple warnings, made a sharp turn, reversed and deliberately rammed into a CCG ship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu added the Philippine side was the party at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philippines said the CCG had fired water cannon and "sideswiped" a government vessel during a maritime patrol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manila also released a video appearing to show a Chinese coast guard ship firing a jet of water at the Philippines fisheries department vessel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CCG accused Manila of making "bogus accusations in an attempt to mislead international understanding".
  <br>
  <br>
  China said Huangyan Dao has always been its territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated last month when Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos signed two laws defining the country's sea waters and imposing fixed lanes for foreign ships, prompting China to summon the Philippine ambassador.
