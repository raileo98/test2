<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia will work together on trade, the economy and investment, President Xi Jinping and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi said he was willing to promote development of Chinese and Malaysian relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am willing to work with you to continue to promote the development of the China-Malaysia community with a shared future in a high-level strategic direction, create more benefits for the people of the two countries, make greater contributions to regional prosperity and stability, and make the friendship between China and Malaysia from generation to generation more prosperous," the president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anwar for his part said the two nations will collaborate in fields including artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not only [are you the] president of a great country, the People's Republic of China, but [you are] a true friend ...We will work together in various fields of endeavour, including the economy, trade, investments, and, of course, new technology, including the AI initiative."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a separate event, Xi and Anwar were present as officials from the two countries exchanged memorandums of understanding in several areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Malaysia as part of a three-nation Southeast Asian trip to consolidate ties with some of the nation's closest neighbours as trade tensions with the United States escalate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Xi met with Malaysia's king, Sultan Ibrahim, in a colourful ceremony at the golden-domed Istana palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Broadcaster CCTV reported that during the meeting, Xi pointed out that the two countries are good neighbours, friends and partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have frequent exchanges and are as close as one family," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This visit at your invitation is not only to fulfill our appointment a year ago to meet in Kuala Lumpur, but also to jointly work with you to usher in a new 'Golden 50 Years' in China-Malaysia relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaysia is the second stop of Xi's five-day, three-nation Southeast Asian tour, which began with a two-day Vietnam state visit. His next stop is Cambodia. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Wednesday that it has appointed a new trade envoy as the world's second-largest economy pushes back against US President Donald Trump's swingeing tariffs on imports that sent global markets tumbling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li Chenggang has assumed the role of representative for international trade negotiations and vice minister of commerce, Beijing's human resources ministry said in a statement on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, 58, previously served as Beijing's ambassador to the World Trade Organization and deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, according to an official biography.
  <br>
  <br>
  He boasts decades of experience in various trade ministry roles and holds law degrees from Peking University and Germany's University of Hamburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replaces Wang Shouwen, the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang took part in talks that led to a 2020 trade deal between China and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Washington have been locked in a high-stakes game of brinkmanship since Trump launched a global tariff assault that has particularly targeted Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tit-for-tat retaliation has pushed US levies imposed on China to 145 percent and Beijing's toll on American goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China said on Wednesday that its economy grew by 5.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, beating expectations even as officials warned that US tariffs were exerting "certain pressures". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices rose in more Chinese cities in March from a month ago as transactions became more vibrant in the real estate market, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A survey by the bureau covering 70 major cities found the prices of new houses were higher in 24 cities last month, up from 18 in February, while resold homes in 10 cities logged price increases, up by seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home prices in first-tier cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, increased, while second and third-tier cities in general registered narrowed price declines, according to the official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a yearly basis, Chinese cities at large continued to see smaller home price drops in March, the bureau said. (Xinhua)

<img alt="China is the biggest supplier of rare metals in the world. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800595_1_20250416113435.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump has ordered a probe that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare-earth metals and associated products such as smartphones in an escalation of his dispute with global trade partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has upended markets in recent weeks with his sweeping on-off levies, and this investigation could see him impose further tariffs if it shows that imports of critical minerals and their derivatives endanger US national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  China dominates global supply chains for rare metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without naming any other countries, the order says that the United States is dependent on foreign sources that "are at risk of serious, sustained, and long-term supply chain shocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  It states that this dependence "raises the potential for risks to national security, defense readiness, price stability, and economic prosperity and resilience."
  <br>
  <br>
  The imports targeted include so-called critical minerals like cobalt, lithium and nickel, rare-earth elements, as well as products that partly require these resources, such as electric vehicles and batteries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order states that critical minerals and their derivatives are essential for US military and energy infrastructure, noting their use in jet engines, missile guidance systems and advanced computing, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Commerce will have up to 180 days to deliver its report to Trump, the order says, adding that any recommendations for action should consider the imposition of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows a similar "national security" investigation that Trump ordered on Monday into pharmaceutical imports, and another on semiconductors and chip-making equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process is based on a 1962 law that was seldom used before Trump, during his first 2017-2021 term, called on it to justify imposing taxes on steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president again resorted to this law, known as Section 232, to reintroduce in mid-March tariffs of 25 percent on steel, aluminium and on automobiles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year in a wide-ranging but often chaotic attempt to reorder the world economy by using levies to force manufacturers to relocate to the United States. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Wednesday the economy grew a forecast-beating 5.4 percent in the first quarter as exporters rushed to get goods out of factory gates ahead of swingeing new US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Washington are locked in a fast-moving, high-stakes game of brinkmanship since US President Donald Trump launched a global tariff assault that has particularly targeted Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen US levies imposed on China rise to 145 percent and Beijing setting a retaliatory 125 percent toll on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the moment, the imposition of high tariffs by the US will put certain pressures on our country's foreign trade and economy," said Sheng Laiyun, Deputy Commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year last year, and the country has set a full-year economic growth target of around 5 percent for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer demand, climbed 4.6 percent in the first quarter – rising 5.9 percent in March alone – while industrial output soared 6.5 percent, up from 5.7 percent in the final three months of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the partial impact from front-loading by exporters, Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said the growth figure still indicated that the momentum has become more "organic" domestically, following a slate of policy stimulus from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at components, household appliances, furniture, communication, equipment, all those have actually grown at a double-digit pace," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we know that stimulus is working, and it's part of the reason why we have that strong retail spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if you look at sales of other items that were not supported by the government, it's still quite strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that gives us encouragement that perhaps the stimulus is not just working in the targeted segments that it wants to work, but it's also giving people the confidence to spend more on other areas as well," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Xu Tianchen, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit who is based in Shanghai, said: "China normally has a tendency of having a high-flying first quarter growth, and then an underwhelming second quarter, that's the pattern."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that the country's growth in the second quarter might slow further, due to the additional "pains" caused by Trump's tariffs, which he said "is effectively causing an embargo on trade between the two nations".
  <br>
  <br>
  "So there will be considerable pressures throughout the second and third quarters, which will then prompt government officials to offer more intervention and stimulus measures to keep the economy afloat," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Xu struck a positive note, saying the economy can still hit its 5 percent growth target this year as Beijing still has a lot of fiscal "firepower" to prop up consumer spending and industrial growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it doesn't really matter whether China will hit its growth target or not as I think the key is to use the 5 percent growth target as a rallying call for the economy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ultimately, China needs to let its economy not be outstripped by the US, and that would be enough," Xu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loo expects the economy to slow to a growth rate of 4 to 4.5 percent in the coming three quarters and that the country will miss its growth target for the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she said the upcoming Communist Party Politburo meeting could offer clues to whether there are more measures on the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really about designing the policy stimulus so that they would have an immediate impact on the economy," Loo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the type of stimulus that would have the most immediate impact would be consumption-oriented stimulus. So we should see more of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] from a political standpoint, it might be, perhaps, more feasible to miss a growth target than to really back down on Trump's request," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think President Xi Jinping could probably look at this and think 'we missed a growth target because of our external shock, but that was highly unanticipated'. Politically, I think missing the growth target is probably not such a bad outcome as it was before."  (With contributions from AFP)

    Nvidia set back by new US ban on H20 chip

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia on Tuesday notified regulators that it expects a US$5.5 billion hit this quarter due to a new US licensing requirement on the primary chip it can legally sell in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials last week told Nvidia it must obtain licences to export its H20 chips to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, the Silicon Valley company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia, which have seen high volatility since US President Donald Trump made a major tariffs announcement on April 2, were down more than six percent in after-market trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new licensing rule applies to Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) with bandwidth similar to that of the H20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had already restricted exports to China of Nvidia's most sophisticated GPUs, tailored for powering top-end artificial intelligence models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia was told the licensing requirement on H20 chips would last indefinitely, it said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia's current fiscal quarter ends on April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately US$5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves," Nvidia said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said publicly that the AI chip powerhouse will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump, and that nothing will stop the global advancement of artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to do that and we'll be able to do that just fine," the entrepreneur told reporters last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's predecessor Joe Biden restricted Nvidia from selling some of its top AI chips to China, which the United States sees as a competitor in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global markets have been on a roller coaster since Trump's April 2 announcement, declining sharply before partially recovering with his 90-day pause on the steepest tariff rates last week. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump believes it is up to China, not the United States, to come to the negotiating table on trade, the White House said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The ball is in China's court. China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them," said a statement from Trump read out by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt at a briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has slapped new tariffs on friend and foe since returning to the presidency this year, but has reserved his heaviest blows for China - imposing additional 145 percent levies on many Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump took aim at Beijing again on Tuesday, saying on Truth Social that China did not fulfil its commitments under an earlier trade deal. He appeared to be referencing a pact that marked a truce in both sides' escalating tariff war during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president said China bought only "a portion of what they agreed to buy," charging that Beijing had "zero respect" for his predecessor Joe Biden's administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leavitt maintained that Trump remained open to a deal with Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed, however, that it was China that needed to step forward first, pointing to the strength of the US consumer market as leverage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the start of the year, Trump has imposed steep duties on imports from China, alongside a 10 percent "baseline" tariff on many US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  His administration recently widened exemptions from these tariffs, excluding certain tech products like smartphones and laptops from the global 10 percent tariff and latest 125 percent levy on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many Chinese imports still face the total 145 percent additional tariff, or at least an earlier 20 percent levy that Trump rolled out over China's alleged role in the fentanyl supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Beijing has introduced counter-tariffs targeting US agricultural goods, and it later retaliated with a sweeping 125 percent levy of its own on imported US products.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has denounced the US tariffs, calling them unilateral and protectionist. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang called on the country's exporters on Tuesday to diversify their markets to cope with external changes, and vowed to support more domestic consumption, in comments on mainland media.
 <br>
  <br>
  China has been hit with the highest tariffs in US President Donald Trump's moves to impose hefty duties on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump hiked duties on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on US goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, profound changes in the external environment have adversely affected China's foreign trade and exports," a radio broadcast cited Li as saying in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should calmly respond to the difficulties and challenges brought by external shocks, promote consumption and expand domestic demand with greater efforts," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese companies should actively explore diversified markets, innovate trade channels and methods, and strive to stabilise foreign trade, Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will help high-quality foreign trade products expand into the domestic market and steadily promote the integrated development of domestic and foreign trade, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest US tariffs took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pledged to take steps to stabilise employment, promote income growth, and strengthen social safety nets to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is still significant room for development in China’s real estate market and efforts should be made to further unlock market potential, Li said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday began a state visit to Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br>
  He expressed hope that his trip will yield fruitful outcomes, ushering in a new "Golden 50 Years" of bilateral relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi was greeted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim when he arrived in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written statement upon his arrival, the president said he expects the visit to open a new historic chapter of good-neighbourly friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a signed article titled "May the Ship of China-Malaysia Friendship Sail Toward an Even Brighter Future" published in local media ahead of his arrival, Xi said he looks forward to meeting with Malaysian friends to celebrate the friendship between the two countries and plan for future cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged Beijing and Kuala Lumpur to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and strengthen cooperation on industrial and supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides must uphold the multilateral trading system, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and maintain an international environment of openness and cooperation, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that China will work with Malaysia and other  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) member states to combat unilateralism and protectionism.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his stay in Malaysia, Xi is expected to discuss a free trade agreement between China and Asean, with Malaysia being the chair of the association this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll meet with King Sultan Ibrahim on Wednesday morning and Anwar later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asean Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn said the agreement will eliminate many tariffs between China and the bloc's members.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will bring more tariffs down to zero in many cases, and then expand to all the areas,” he said in an interview with CGTN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi is on a three-nation overseas trip. He earlier visited Vietnam during which Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president will later visit Cambodia on the final leg of his trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An updated mandatory national standard on the safety of electric vehicle batteries in China is set to take effect on July 1 next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The standard is laid out in "Safety Requirements for Power Batteries Used in Electric Vehicles (GB38031-2025)," according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revisions include updates to thermal diffusion testing of batteries, further clarifying temperature requirements, observation time and vehicle testing conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new bottom impact test has been introduced to assess the protective capabilities for the battery from impacts to its base.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new safety test following fast charging cycles has also been added, which requires external short circuit testing after 300 fast-charging cycles, mandating no fire or explosion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised version clearly states that the standard applies to power batteries for electric vehicles, excluding non-propulsion batteries. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 137th edition of the China Import and Export Fair, also known as Canton Fair, kicked off on Tuesday, with the number of export exhibitors exceeding 30,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This year's edition of the fair, which ends on May 5, has attracted around 31,000 participating firms, up by nearly 900 over last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200,000 overseas buyers from 215 countries and regions have preregistered, with the lineup featuring the likes of retail giants Walmart and Target from the United States, Carrefour from France, Tesco and Kingfisher from Britain, and Germany's Metro.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair is divided into three phases: advanced manufacturing, home furnishings and products that promote a better quality of life.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will involve 172 product zones, including, for the first time, a special zone for service robots focused on showcasing the latest achievements of China's AI development efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This Canton Fair is held in the year when China's '14th Five-Year Plan' nears completion – which is of great significance in promoting the innovative development of trade, thus ensuring stable foreign trade volume and improving foreign trade quality," said Zhang Sihong, deputy director of the China Foreign Trade Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the large gathering of global buyers at the fair underlined the trust of the international business community in made-in-China products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fair has always been an important driver of global trade, said Andre Rocha, president of the Federation of Industries of the State of Goias, Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here, people can learn about the major global development trends and cutting-edge technologies, as well as solutions that can actually boost industrial development, he added. (Xinhua)

 President Xi Jinping has described his state visit to Vietnam as "fruitful albeit brief" as he wrapped up his two-day trip on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi urged China and Vietnam to jointly oppose power politics and unilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart Luong Cuong, Xi said trade wars will undermine the international trading system, stability of the global economic order and legitimate interests of all countries in the world, especially developing nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added he has full confidence in the future of bilateral relations when he bid farewell to Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing and Hanoi signed dozens of cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, artificial intelligence, joint maritime patrols and railway development, during the president's visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to one of the cooperation documents, the two sides agreed that China will carry out feasibility studies for two planned rail links.
  <br>
  <br>
  One connects southern Guangxi region to the Vietnamese capital Hanoi; the other involves a new line linking Shenzhen and Haiphong.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump complained about the visit, saying it was aimed at hurting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi next heads to Malaysia on the second leg of his three-nation tour, which will also take him to Cambodia. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese engineers began on Tuesday a difficult operation to remove a second sample of radioactive debris from inside the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 880 tonnes of hazardous material are inside the site after a catastrophic tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake triggered one of history's worst nuclear accidents in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Removing the debris is seen as the most daunting challenge in a decades-long decommissioning project because of the dangerously high radiation levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 10.03am [9.03am Hong Kong time], the second trial extraction operation was started," Fukushima operator Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second removal comes after Tepco completed the first trial removal operation using a specially developed extendible device in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sample weighing just below 0.7 grams – equivalent to about one raisin – was delivered to a research lab near Tokyo for analysis.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Tepco needs more data to examine methods for full-scale debris extractions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said in December it was "upgrading" the telescopic device used for the first experiment by attaching a new camera to its tip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three of Fukushima's six reactors went into meltdown in 2011 after the huge tsunami swamped the facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, robots began moving sandbags that were used to absorb radiation-contaminated water on underground floors of two buildings at the Fukushima site.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, Japan began releasing into the Pacific Ocean some of the 540 Olympic swimming pools' worth of treated wastewater in a move that has been endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  China banned Japanese seafood imports as a result, and Russia later followed suit.
  <br>
  <br>
  This month China said it found no abnormalities in seawater and marine life samples that it independently collected near Fukushima in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Beijing indicated that more tests would be needed before it lifts the ban. (AFP)

 The director of the central government's liaison office Zheng Yanxiong said on Tuesday that Hong Kong should push for greater development and contribute more to the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Zheng pointed out that the office will fully implement the central government's request to fully support the chief executive and SAR government to turn Beijing's hopes into concrete actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The director said Hong Kong should firmly coordinate high-quality development and a high level of security to achieve a positive interaction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He emphasised that if security cannot be maintained, development will not be solid.
  <br>
  <br>
  If development is delayed and neglected, the basis of security will not be firm, Zheng said, adding that Hong Kong has to maintain its positive momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said that the SAR should contribute more to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new phase of Hong Kong has both traditional strengths, as well as new advantages, such as AI, research and development, innovation and technology, talent hub and coordinated development with the Greater Bay Area, etc.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It even has unique strengths such as institutional innovation and acting as a gateway between the mainland and the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The liaison office director also stressed that safeguarding national security needs continuous effort.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said Hong Kong will grasp the opportunities brought by a new economic and trade order amid the tariff war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Lee slammed the United States for being "ridiculous" and "making wrong calculations" after the country imposed a total of 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted Hong Kong does not levy tariffs on imports and exports, and that the moves by the US are damaging the multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR should be fully prepared for challenges, and make good use of its strengths as an international financial centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has changed the world's economic and trade order. A new order will be formed. In the process, there are both risks and opportunities for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are looking into possible opportunities that can be generated by the new order. Hong Kong is a free port with zero tariffs, and this can attract more trade and business activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said Hong Kong will explore new markets and deepen regional cooperation, such as with Asean, the Middle East and Belt and Road countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that stability has been restored in Hong Kong after the national security law took effect five years ago, but the city should be prepared for turbulent and stormy times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must always remember that the aftermath of the 2019 black-clad violence has not come to an end. There are still attempts at the resurgence of anti-China and anti-Hong Kong forces, with acts of soft resistance, and inciting disgust and hatred," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the government will use new methods to promote national security education, such as making use of different media platforms and technologies.

    Xia Baolong: United States after our very survival

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing SAR affairs on Tuesday slammed the United States for imposing heavy tariffs on Hong Kong, calling the move "extremely arrogant and shameless".
 <br>
  <br>
  Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said in a video address that the up to 145 percent US tariffs on SAR goods showed "the US isn't after our tariffs – it is after our very survival".
  <br>
  <br>
  Addressing the opening ceremony of the National Security Education Day, Xia said the US levies were particularly unreasonable given the SAR is a free port with no tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This makes it clearer to the world that the US cannot tolerate Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and it is the biggest 'sinister manipulator' undermining human rights, freedom, the rule of law, prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia said the US has continued its suppression and containment of the SAR time and time again, adding that these actions will ultimately backfire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let those American peasants wail before the 5,000-year-old civilisation of the Chinese nation! History and reality tell us that the Chinese people will never accept bullying and all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots, cannot be intimidated or overwhelmed," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese have a proverb – strike a punch to avoid a hundred punches... Whether it is a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, we have nothing to fear. The sky will not fall," Xia added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Beijing official also criticised the US for sanctioning six mainland and Hong Kong officials, accusing it of fabricating the so-called 2025 Hong Kong Policy Act Report, "once again exposing US' bullying and hegemonic true colours and its ugly face of hysteria born of desperation".
  <br>
  <br>
  And while Hong Kong appears calm on the surface, Xia warned of underlying security concerns and stressed that the struggle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong have not yet been eliminated... Many people still have confused ideas, some sympathise with those who are opposed to China and attempt to destabilise Hong Kong, some justify them, and some admire, fear, worship or fantasise about the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed confidence in Hong Kong's business sector despite US pressure on China, saying that enterprises will continue to thrive with the city's unique advantages and strong backing from the nation.

<img alt="Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs says the US could face an uphill battle in its trade dispute with China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800419_1_20250415112206.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Renowned American economist, Jeffrey Sachs, on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump would not win the trade war against China, as Beijing is no longer as dependent on US markets as it was in the past.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the world's two largest economies remain in a stand-off over sweeping tariffs that Washington imposed this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Sachs, who teaches economics at Columbia University, said it was a "mistake" for the United States to launch the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no doubt it started on the US side. The US actions violate international rules, and they violate economic sense. They will create costs, both for the US, for China, and for the rest of the world. But the biggest costs will be borne by the United States, especially US consumers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US consumers will face higher prices and lower living standards, that's why they're pessimistic. Some consumers are already cutting back on their consumption knowing that they're going to suffer a decline of living standards in future months, even with the risk of a recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] I think that the [consumer] costs in China will be much lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's shipments to the US amounted to around US$440 billion last year, Sachs said that accounted for only a small share of the country's total US$3.68 trillion worth of exports in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The truth is, the United States is not going to win this trade war, as China is just not as dependent on the US market as Donald Trump seems to think."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sachs, who is also the director of Columbia’s Centre for Sustainable Development, noted the global trading system would remain open despite the sweeping tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The open trading system will continue, but the United States might not be part of it, and this will be at a big cost to the United States, a big economic cost, a big development cost, and a big geopolitical cost."

    EV battery giant CATL records surge in Q1 profit

<img alt="CATL had a bullish first quarter of 2025.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's leading maker of electric vehicle batteries, CATL, posted a 32.9 percent jump in first quarter profit, even as demand for electric vehicles slows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, cooperating with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2011 in the eastern city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit in the first quarter was up 32.9 percent year-on-year to 13.96 billion yuan (US$1.91 billion), according to a statement CATL released on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the same period, CATL's sales rose by 6.2 percent year-on-year to 84.7 billion yuan, the filing showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL has been aided by strong financial support from Beijing, which has sought in recent years to shore up domestic strength in certain strategic high-tech sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, CATL warned in January that its slide in sales last year was likely due to a "decline in the prices of raw materials such as lithium carbonate", which had forced the firm to adjust prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year saw lithium prices fall significantly, partly due to market oversupply and weaker consumer demand for EVs. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police in Harbin, in northeast Heilongjiang province, said on Tuesday they were pursuing three operatives affiliated with the US National Security Agency (NSA) over suspected cyberattacks against China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Harbin public security bureau named the three as Katheryn A Wilson, Robert J Snelling, and Stephen W Johnson, accusing them of launching cyberattacks targeting the Asian Winter Games that took place in Harbin in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities said investigations by Chinese technical teams said the NSA focused its pre-event cyberattacks on critical systems of the Asian Winter Games, including registration, arrival and departure management, and competition entry platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said these systems, essential for pre-event operations, stored vast amounts of sensitive personal data of individuals associated with the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities also accused the NSA of cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure sectors in Heilongjiang province, including energy, transportation, water resources, telecommunications, and defence research institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They accused the three NSA operatives of repeated cyberattacks against China's critical information infrastructure and cyber operations on companies such as Huawei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The authorities stated that their technical teams also uncovered evidence implicating the University of California and Virginia Tech in the coordinated cyber campaign against the Asian Winter Games. (Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Vietnam on Monday signed dozens of cooperation agreements, strengthening ties between the two countries after President Xi Jinping warned that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi is in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour, as Beijing tries to present itself as a stable alternative to an erratic US President Donald Trump, who announced – and then mostly reversed – sweeping tariffs this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi was welcomed to Hanoi with a 21-cannon salute, a guard of honour and rows of flag-waving children at the presidential palace, before holding talks with Vietnam's top leaders including General Secretary To Lam.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two neighbours signed 45 cooperation agreements, including on supply chains, AI, joint maritime patrols and railway development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit comes almost two weeks after the United States – manufacturing powerhouse Vietnam's biggest export market in the first three months of the year – slapped a 46 percent levy on Vietnamese goods as part of a global trade blitz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and most other countries have been paused, China still faces enormous levies and is seeking to tighten regional trade ties and offset their impact during Xi's first overseas trip of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will depart Vietnam on Tuesday, travelling onwards to Malaysia and Cambodia on a tour that "bears major importance" for the broader region, Beijing has said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking during a meeting with Lam, Xi said Vietnam and China were "standing at the turning point of history... and should move forward with joint hands".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi earlier urged the two countries to "resolutely safeguard the multilateral trading system, stable global industrial and supply chains, and open and cooperative international environment".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reiterated Beijing's line that a "trade war and tariff war will produce no winner, and protectionism will lead nowhere" in an article published on Monday in Vietnam's major state-run Nhan Dan newspaper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam's Lam said in an article posted on the government's news portal on Monday that his country "is always ready to join hands with China to make cooperation between the two countries more substantive, profound, balanced and sustainable". (AFP)

 Beijing will fully support Hong Kong in "riding the tide of global digital transition", according to a senior national political adviser.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as he criticised "technological bullying" as well as the zero-sum game by some countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came on the opening day of the World Internet Conference Asia Pacific Summit in Hong Kong, the first time the conference is being held in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the opening ceremony, Wang Yong, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, noted said the digital transition has become a driving force in boosting industrial productivity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is committed to sharing the opportunities brought about by the development of the internet industry with other regions in the world, noting that mainland firms such as DeepSeek, which has shared its open-source AI models with the global tech community, aim to remove such digital gaps between nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have worked with other countries to build a fair and 'just cyberspace governance system, and we firmly uphold the basic concepts and principles enshrined in the United Nations charter," Wang told some 1,000 participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We call for respecting the sovereignty and management model of each country's network and rejecting the zero-sum game and technological bullying," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Wang did not name the parties involved in such practices, Beijing has been calling for relations between China and the United States to not be a zero sum game and for both sides to seek common ground to gain a "win-win" outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Wang, Zheng Yanxiong, the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, said the SAR plays a critical role in driving the industry's development in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is a pioneer in the development of the internet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has not only its traditional advantages being a global financial, shipping and trade centre but also new advantages such as artificial intelligence research and development, accumulated talent and industrial synergy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, it has unique advantages such as institutional innovation, trilingualism, cultural inclusiveness, and internal and external communication... It will certainly be a new development highland of the internet industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Zheng called on the SAR to play its role by speeding up the building of an ecosystem for digital-related sectors, covering artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and block chains, that spans upstream and downstream industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged the SAR to give full play to the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, establishing a cross-border data flow mechanism that's also in line with international rules, and promote the safe and orderly cross-border data flow and sharing of resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  The summit ends on Tuesday.

 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hanoi on Monday to start a state visit to Vietnam.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a written statement upon his arrival at the Noi Bai International Airport, Xi said he was very pleased to start his fourth state visit to Vietnam at the invitation of General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee To Lam and Vietnamese President Luong Cuong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that this year marks the 95th anniversary of the founding of the CPV, the 80th anniversary of the founding of Vietnam and the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the South, Xi said the CPV has united and led the Vietnamese people in steadfast pursuit of realising the two goals set for the centenary of the party and the country respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added that the Chinese side is pleased to see that living standards in Vietnam have steadily improved, Vietnam's global and regional influence has continued to grow, and the country has made notable progress in advancing its socialist industrialisation and modernisation drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi expressed his belief that under the strong leadership of the CPV Central Committee, Vietnam will surely pursue the socialist path suited to its national conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the Foreign Ministry said the president called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also visit Malaysia and Cambodia on his current overseas trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing's top official overseeing Hong Kong and Macau affairs, Xia Baolong, is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech via video link at the 10th National Security Education Day on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Organised by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the SAR, the ceremony and a seminar will take place at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Chief Executive John Lee expressed gratitude to Xia, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, for his guidance and support for Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee pointed out that this year marks the fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the National Security Law, as well as the first anniversary of the implementation of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, the world is undergoing unprecedented changes at an accelerating pace. The geopolitical landscape is getting complicated, regional conflicts are frequent, global economic growth is slowing down, and unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise, all contributing to increasing global instability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With Hong Kong faced with ever-changing national security risks, the HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, deepen the understanding of a holistic approach to national security, continuously improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security, and actively promote national security education across society," Lee said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE also said the authorities will co-ordinate school and community activities to promote national security education.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports rose 12.4 percent year-on-year in March, beating analysts' expectations as the world's second largest economy braces for an intensifying trade war with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs data also showed on Monday that imports contracted 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Export growth last month was driven by Chinese factories rushing out shipments ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyu Daliang, a spokesman for the General Administration of Customs, said China is facing a severe and complex external situation, but that the sky would not fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, China has actively diversified its markets and deepened industrial and supply chain cooperation with partners worldwide. This has not only fuelled the development of other economies, but also strengthened our own resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, China's vast domestic market serves as a crucial stabilising force. We will remain steadfast in focusing on our own priorities, using our internal certainty to navigate external uncertainties."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has ramped up duties on Chinese goods to eye-watering levels of 145 percent, prompting Beijing to raise retaliatory tariffs on US imports. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A leading commentator on Chinese affairs on Monday said the US trade war would prove costly for all concerned, including the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said China would not only defend its interests, but also protect the world trading order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this round of the trade war, the United States is absolutely the wrong party. It started the war. It instigated the war. It used maximum pressure and intimidation against almost all the other countries, and China needs to do the right thing, that is jump up to the occasion and fiercely defend its legitimate interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, for the rest of the world, China needs to exercise a leadership role in defending free trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao said American consumers would suffer as the tariffs made goods more expensive and suspected Washington was using the threat of import taxes to weaponise the global trading system to its own ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It still demonstrates that the US administration, as far as the maximum tariffs are concerned, is still using these tariffs as a weapon, trying to achieve other goals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's blackmail, maximum pressure, intimidation, or bringing in other strategic goals, it remains to be seen. Therefore, I think, the Chinese position is to call on the US government to do the right thing and to cancel all the tariffs, because that is the only right thing to do."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping called for stronger cooperation with Vietnam in industrial and supply chains and wider collaboration in emerging fields, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xi starts a three-nation tour of Southeast Asia this week, beginning his state visits with Vietnam from April 14 to 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi also urged strengthening coordination and cooperation through regional initiatives such as the East Asia Cooperation and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, the ministry said, citing an article by the president published in Vietnam media.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called such efforts necessary to "inject more stability and positive energy into a chaotic and intertwined world".
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars, and protectionism has no way out," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, maintain the stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and maintain the international environment for open cooperation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Xi said China welcomes more high-quality imports from Vietnam and encourages more Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in the Southeast Asian country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both countries should expand cooperation in emerging fields such as 5G, artificial intelligence and green development, the article said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's visit, planned for weeks, comes as Beijing faces 145 percent US duties, while Vietnam is negotiating a reduction of threatened US tariffs of 46 percent that would otherwise apply in July after a global moratorium expires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi will visit Malaysia and Cambodia from April 15 to 18. He last visited Cambodia and Malaysia nine and 12 years ago, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi's trip to Hanoi is his second in less than 18 months. The two are set to sign about 40 agreements in multiple sectors, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Bui Thanh Son said on Saturday, noting Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation on railways, agricultural trade and the digital and green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is also seeking Vietnam's approval for its COMAC planes. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sweeping cold front has brought fierce winds across northern China, prompting widespread weather warnings, transport suspensions and emergency response measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Meteorological Center (NMC) on Saturday renewed an alert for strong gales that were expected to sweep the country's northern and coastal regions over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  To ensure public safety, Beijing temporarily shut 15 overground railway sections, affecting a total of 106 stations and over 200 kilometres of tracks. Numerous parks and museums were closed, including the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven and Beihai Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of 10 am on Saturday, a total of 288 trees were toppled across the city due to the strong winds, damaging 19 vehicles, according to Beijing's emergency management authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's airports cancelled hundreds of flights scheduled for Saturday, and a humanoid-robot half marathon that was set to take place on Sunday was postponed to April 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  No injuries or fatalities related to the extreme winds were reported in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  In northern Shanxi Province, the State Grid branch deployed over 3,000 personnel to inspect and reinforce electrical facilities. Emergency repair teams and mobile generators were positioned across the province in advance to ensure rapid power restoration in the event of outages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, strong winds disrupted rail, road and air traffic. (Xinhua)

 China is committed to safeguarding an open, inclusive, transparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has told Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.
 <br>
  <br>
  During a video call, the pair exchanged views on issues such as responding to the so-called "reciprocal tariffs" imposed by the United States, maintaining the multilateral trading system, and giving play to the role of the WTO, according to a statement released by the Commerce Ministry on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said the fabrication of "reciprocal tariffs" out of thin air by the United States is a typical practice of unilateral bullying and these tariffs will inflict serious harm on developing countries, especially the least developed nations, and could even trigger humanitarian crises.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on WTO members to unite and counter unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying practices through openness, cooperation, and multilateralism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Okonjo-Iweala said that escalating trade tensions have posed serious challenges to global trade and economic growth prospects and WTO members should work together to defend an open, rules-based multilateral trading system, resolving differences through dialogue and cooperation under the WTO framework.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pan Yundong, deputy commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, has called for all sectors to leverage the SAR's advantages in telling good stories about Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an event on Friday, Pan said Beijing is committed to becoming a source of stability as the world undergoes unprecedented changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He highlighted how Chinese cultural appeal had resonated worldwide, and urged all sectors to showcase the nation's credible, lovable, and respectable image.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Hong Kong transitions from stability to prosperity, Pan said the SAR government is implementing reforms with strong central government backing. He hopes everyone will adopt the can-do attitude known as the "Lion Rock Spirit".
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also noted how new technologies like AI and big data are changing how people communicate. He said Hongkongers should embrace these changes, while helping shape a positive narrative for the city and the nation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top EU officials and Chinese leaders are due to hold their next summit marking 50 years of ties in China in July, a spokesperson for the European Council said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The European Union had announced plans for a summit in January, before US President Donald Trump took office and unleashed swingeing tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are coordinating with China to set a date for the meeting, which is expected to take place in China in the second half of July," said the official at the council, the body representing the EU's 27 countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bloc faces a delicate balancing act, seeking to negotiate with an unpredictable ally in Washington to avoid tariffs and the need to diversify trading partners, with its bid to hold the line on its own trade concerns regarding China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Friday, President Xi Jinping urged the EU to join hands with Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying", referring to sweeping tariffs imposed by Trump.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping urged the European Union on Friday to join hands with China in resisting "unilateral bullying", in reference to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  As he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday, Xi stressed the need for cooperation between the bloc and Beijing in weathering Trump's continual escalations in the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China and Europe should fulfil their international responsibilities... and jointly resist unilateral bullying practices," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This, he stressed, would not only "safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also... safeguard international fairness and justice."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added there is no winner in a tariff war, and going against the world will only result in self-isolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said for more than 70 years, China has achieved development through self-reliance and does not fear unreasonable suppression.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi added that no matter how the external world changes, China will remain confident and focused on running its own affairs well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez, in turn, said following the meeting in Beijing that tensions over trade should not impede cooperation between China and the EU.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both Spain and Europe have a significant trade deficit with China that we must work to rectify," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sanchez also said "we must not let trade tensions stand in the way of the potential growth of the relationship between China and Spain and between China and the EU".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain buys about 45 billion euros of goods every year from China, its fourth-largest trading partner, but sells around 7.4 billion euros' worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanchez's trip comes as the EU rethinks its global trading relationships in the face of turmoil caused by the US import duties announced last week that have sent world markets into a tailspin.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China blasted US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday as a "numbers game" that "will become a joke", as Beijing raised levies on US imports to 125 percent and said it would go no further.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement followed the US move to raise the "reciprocal tariffs" on Chinese imports to 125 percent, bringing the total to 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's Customs Tariff Commission said the US imposition of excessively high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, goes against basic economic laws and common sense, and is nothing but unilateral bullying and coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commission said even if Washington is to raise tariffs further, it would no longer make economic sense and ultimately go down as a joke in world economic history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given that it's already impossible for the Chinese market to accept US imports at the current tariff level, if the United States imposes further tariffs on Chinese products, China will ignore it," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's duties on Chinese products have "become a numbers game with no practical significance in economics", a spokesperson for the Commerce Ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 125 percent tariffs on US goods are up from 84 percent, and will take effect from Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China has filed a lawsuit against the US with the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism following the latest American tariff hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countermeasure by Beijing came after US President Donald Trump's latest escalation in a tit-for-tat trade war that he started by singling China out even as he hit a pause on additional tariffs for other countries. (Xinhua/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibitions and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump claimed victory over Europe in the US tariffs war but acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China as markets plunged again on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump sought a victory lap at a White House cabinet meeting, saying the European Union had backed off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were very smart. They were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil. "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was upbeat, telling reporters that "I don't see anything unusual today," as he touted better than expected US inflation numbers and other economic indicators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But major indices spent the entire day in the red, with the broad-based S&P 500 finishing down 3.5 percent after soaring 9.5 percent on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.5 percent, while the tech-rich Nasdaq slumped 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dialling back of the planned global trade war left most of the focus on China, the world's number two economy after the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House on Thursday clarified that levies on Chinese imports are now at a staggering total of 145 percent - not the previously reported 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was because the latest tariff hike comes on top of a 20 percent tariff already imposed earlier. China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union welcomed the US president's partial row-back on his original threat to impose 20 percent tariffs against the bloc.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-nation grouping responded with its own olive branch, suspending for 90 days tariffs on 20 billion euros' worth of US goods that had been greenlit in retaliation to duties on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its latest measure, the Commerce Ministry in Beijing announced it would reduce the number of Hollywood films imported, but said it remained ready for dialogue. (AFP)

 Postal Savings Bank of China has announced a commitment to provide no less than 10 trillion yuan in financing to private businesses over the next five years, reinforcing its dedication to supporting the country's private sector amid economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lender said it is expected to earmark at least three trillion yuan specifically for technology innovators and over three trillion yuan targeting agricultural sector development, as part of efforts to help more than 5,000 companies in the private sector enhance their governance capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The major state-owned commercial bank, in partnership with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently introduced an action plan aimed at empowering private enterprises, targeting operational growth, technological innovation and digital transformation, among other critical areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key programs under the plan include a tailored financing pipeline for private companies, tech R&D support packages, and digital upgrades for small businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2024, the bank's outstanding loans to private enterprises had reached 2.44 trillion yuan – which served over 3.4 million businesses. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Thursday said China will continue taking countermeasures to safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests, emphasising that protectionism is a one-way road.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a news conference, ministry spokesperson He Yongqian pointed out that China’s foreign trade resiliency has not diminished, despite facing increasingly significant challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said authorities are confident about its ability in dealing with various trade risks and challenges, and that the nation will hedge against uncertainty coming from the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will "follow through to the end" if the US insists on its own way, He said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also warned that the US tariffs severely impact global economic stability, warning that there is no winner in a trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has recently... announced the imposition of indiscriminate tariffs on all its trading partners, including China, which seriously infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and severely impact the stability of the global economic order," He said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that while the door is always open, using pressure, threats and blackmail is not the way to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dialogue must be on the basis of mutual respect and equality, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a regular Foreign Ministry briefing, spokesman Lin Jian said China does not want to fight trade and tariff wars, but will not flinch when it comes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the US tariffs go "against the whole world" and seriously undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system as well as the stability of the global economic order. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Thursday said China was justified in retaliating against US tariffs with trade levies of its own.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said the country was only responding to what he said were America's "bullying tactics", but held out hope that a deal could eventually be worked out between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is always open to a fair talk, you know, sitting at the table, not by just starting something, you know, adding 10 percent, 10 percent, 34 percent and 50 percent, forcing other countries to accept [their terms]...  I think we should all sit down and talk about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lam expressed confidence that Hong Kong could weather the storm, he said things could get tough if the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continued, adding he was working with the government to ensure support for local exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am asking the government to help. I met with HKMA the other day, first of all, I asked them to ask the banks to extend loans, loan repayment periods. So this is first very, very important and essential. And I also [asked] to extend the interest only repayment relief, which is the payment holiday for 12 more months."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer prices fell for the second straight month in March, as caution grows over the economic outlook amid mounting tariff risks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent last month from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. That was slower than February's 0.7 percent decline, but missed the Reuters poll forecast for prices to remain flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.4 percent month-on-month, against a 0.2 percent fall in February and missing an estimated 0.3 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, edged up 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, reversing a 0.1 percent fall in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index, meanwhile, declined 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, deepening the 2.2 percent fall in February, the weakest in four months and below the expected 2.3 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing unveiled a series of measures to boost the economy last year, including cutting interest rates and cancelling restrictions on the purchase of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s economic recovery is also facing headwinds after US President Donald Trump further raised tariffs on China to 125 percent. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have exchanged views on strengthening their economic and trade cooperation in response to US tariffs, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry said China and the EU vowed to jointly uphold the multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement came after Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and the European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic held a talk via video on Tuesday, during which they discussed various issues, including enhancing China-EU economic and trade cooperation and responses to the US imposition of so-called "reciprocal tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang urged China and the EU to jointly safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system and adhere to trade liberalisation and facilitation, "which will inject more stability and certainty into the world economy and global trade", the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and EU also discussed creating a more favourable business environment for enterprises and trade transfer issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will continue to strengthen communication under the World Trade Organization framework and jointly promote WTO reform, the ministry statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a statement, both sides will immediately carry out negotiations on electric vehicle price commitments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU had imposed tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on China-made electric vehicles at the end of October, on top of the bloc's standard 10 percent car import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said last week that the two sides have agreed to restart negotiations on minimum price commitments on Chinese EVs but did not specify when that would resume. (Reuters, additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday denounced the reintroduction of a United States bill that threatens closures of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Offices (ETO) in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong SAR said that the ETOs' role of promoting economic and trade cooperation between the city and the US should not be challenged, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office noted that the ETOs are official institutions representing the SAR in the US and that "the smearing attack" on these offices launched by certain US politicians disrupts day-to-day exchanges between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  These politicians should stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, the spokesperson said, adding that any further moves in the wrong direction will be met with countermeasures.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will increase tariffs on US goods by 50 percent, bringing it to a total of 84 percent, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tariff, which previously stood at 34 percent, takes effect from Thursday at 12.01pm Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The tariff escalation against China by the United States simply piles mistakes on top of mistakes [and] severely infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests," the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's moves "severely damage the multilateral rules-based trade system", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It comes as US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into force on Wednesday. They had been set at 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that countries which do not retaliate to US President Donald Trump's fresh tariffs would not face higher rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what a lot of people are missing here is that the levels that were put out last Wednesday are a ceiling, if you don't retaliate," Bessent told a summit in Washington, adding that China has chosen to escalate the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing had earlier on Wednesday said the nation will resolutely take countermeasures and fight till the end if the US insists on further escalating economic and trade restrictive measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has also told the World Trade Organization that the US' tariffs threatened to further destabilise global trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The situation has dangerously escalated...As one of the affected members, China expresses grave concern and firm opposition to this reckless move," it said in a statement to the WTO.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism late on Wednesday issued a travel alert for Chinese people visiting the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry said it issued the alert because of the worsening economic and trade relations between the two countries, as well as the security situation in the US. (Additional reporting by Reuters and AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US tariff on small goods parcels sent from mainland China and Hong Kong has been tripled in the latest escalation by US President Donald Trump of the ongoing trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duty on small parcels, previously exempt from duties as part of the de diminis rule, will be increased to US$75 from the US$25 that Trump had set as part of his original opening salvo in the trade war on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US$75 duty will take effect on parcels sent from May 2 and before June 1, which was the period when the original US$25 levy was to come into play. That US$25 levy was originally set to be increased to US$50 after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  An amendment to the so-called reciprocal tariffs published by the White House on Wednesday Hong Kong time said the new rate on packages priced up to US$800 will be 90 percent of their value, up from the original 30 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the amendment, the per postal item fee will also be tripled to US$150 from the planned US$50 that was to go into effect after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff came into play as Trump made good on his punitive measure against China after it had reciprocated his 34 percent tariffs by a similar quantum.
  <br>
  <br>
  That brought his latest tariffs to 84 percent, making the total, on top of the 20 percent in levies imposed in February and March, 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The punitive tariffs come as around 60 percent of all de minimis packages entering the United States come from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, meanwhile expressed strong disapproval over the US' move.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesman said the US measures were unreasonable, and its ever-changing policies have caused confusion and inconvenience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US no longer upholds free trade, arbitrarily undermining the rules of the World Trade Organization jointly established by the international community, seriously impeding the multilateral trading system and globalisation process, and disrupting the global supply chain," the spokesman wrote in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It pointed out that Hongkong Post will not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement added that, for now, Hongkong Post will maintain postal services to the US, but it will announce later the temporary suspension arrangement for postal services to the country.

 China said on Wednesday it is verifying reports of Chinese nationals being captured in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in a regular briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian also urged its citizens to avoid conflict zones and participating in wars, after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said troops had captured two Chinese citizens fighting alongside Russian forces.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese side is verifying relevant information with the Ukrainian side," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zelensky said in a social media post that two Chinese citizens were captured in the Donetsk region. (Agencies)

    'China has firm will to take countermeasures'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures and fight till the end if the United States insists on further escalating economic and trade restrictive measures, with firm will and abundant means.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that there is no winner in a trade war, and China does not want a trade war, but the Chinese government will by no means sit by when the legitimate rights and interests of its people are being hurt and deprived," an official with the ministry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments came as US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into force on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official also said Beijing hopes Washington will immediately remove its unilateral imposition of tariffs, and work with China to strengthen dialogue, manage differences and promote cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the guise of pursuing "reciprocity" and "fairness," the US is engaging in zero-sum games and, in essence, seeking "America First" and "American exceptionalism," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the US is also deliberately severing the well-established global industrial and supply chains and breaking the market-oriented free trade rules, the official said these practices seriously interrupt the economic development of countries around the globe and affect the long-term stable growth of the world economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a regular briefing that "the Chinese people's legitimate right to development is inalienable".
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's sovereignty, security and development interests are inviolable," he said. "We will continue to take firm and forceful measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests." (Xinhua & agencies)

  <br>
  <br>
  It said there is a need to jointly safeguard the stability of the region and carry out security and law enforcement cooperation to cope with risks and challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The meeting also noted that the nation’s relationship with neighbouring countries is at its best in recent times.
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China-US economic and trade relations are mutually beneficial and win-win in nature, and cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation harms both, said a white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maintaining the stable development of China-US economic and trade relations is in the fundamental interest of both nations and peoples, which is also conducive to global economic development, according to the white paper titled "China's Position on Some Issues Concerning China-US Economic and Trade Relations."
  <br>
  <br>
  The release of the white paper came on the same day steep US tariffs of 104 percent for Chinese goods came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, Beijing and Washington can resolve differences in economic and trade areas through equal-footed dialogue and mutually beneficial cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equal-footed dialogue should constitute the fundamental approach in addressing problems between major countries, the white paper said, adding that mutually beneficial cooperation can help the two countries realise their respective development goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The white paper noted the world anticipates China-US cooperation to generate more development opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the document, the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration will damage its own and others' interests, and is a severe violation of World Trade Organization rules that damages the multilateral trading system and erodes the legitimate rights and interests of the parties affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also said tariffs will increase inflationary pressure in the United States, weaken its industrial base, aggravate panic in the financial market and increase the risk of US economic recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "History has repeatedly taught the lesson that trade protectionism will not help strengthen a country's domestic economy," the white paper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, it will do severe damage to world trade and investment, which could trigger a global economic and financial crisis, with the inevitable consequences for oneself and others." (Reporting by Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs on dozens of countries took effect on Wednesday, including massive 104 percent duties on Chinese goods, deepening his global trade war even as he prepared for negotiations with some nations.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's punishing tariffs have shaken a global trading order that has persisted for decades, raised fears of recession and driven worldwide stocks sharply downward.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 has shed nearly US$6 trillion in value since Trump unveiled the tariffs a week ago, the deepest four-day loss since the benchmark's creation in the 1950s.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index is now nearing a bear market, defined as 20 percent below its most recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has made clear that country-specific tariffs of up to 50 percent would take effect at 0401 GMT as planned. Those tariffs will be especially steep for China, as Trump has ratcheted up duties on its imports to 104 percent in response to counter-tariffs Beijing announced last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has refused to bow to what it called blackmail and has vowed to fight to the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing on Tuesday that President Trump believed China wanted to make a deal with the United States concerning additional tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Chinese want to make a deal. They just don't know how to do it," Leavitt said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He believes China has to make a deal with the United States." If China reaches out, she added, Trump would be "incredibly gracious, but he's going to do what's best for the American people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country's 25 percent tariff on some vehicles - a countermeasure to match Trump's approach - would take effect immediately after midnight local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "President Trump caused this trade crisis - and Canada is responding with purpose and with force," Carney said on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada and Mexico were exempt from the new round of tariffs Trump announced last week, but previous levies remained in place. Most goods that comply with the existing trade agreement between the three countries are not subject to those tariffs. (Reuters)

 China is ready to fight till the end if the United States is bent on waging a tariff war or trade war, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the US threat of an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese imports, spokesman Lin Jian said the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs by the US seriously violates the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and the rules of the World Trade Organization, seriously damages the rule-based multilateral trading system, and seriously impacts the stability of the global economic order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is typical unilateralism, protectionism, and economic bullying, and has been widely opposed by the international community," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that pressuring, threatening and blackmailing are not the right ways to deal with China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its lawful rights and interests," Lin said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the United States ignores the interests of the two countries and the international community and insists on fighting tariff wars and trade wars, China will surely fight till the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Premier Li Qiang said China's macroeconomic policies this year have fully taken into account various uncertainties and it has sufficient policy tools in reserve, adding that Beijing was "fully capable of hedging against adverse external influences".
  <br>
  <br>
  Li made the comments in a phone call with the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, who urged Beijing to ensure a negotiated solution to problems caused by the sweeping US import tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier added that China's countermeasures are aimed not only at safeguarding the country's sovereignty, security and development interest, but also at defending global trade rules and international fairness and justice.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said China will continue its opening-up policies and step up cooperation with other countries. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against Trump's tariffs on Friday with extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods, adding to the 10 to 15 percent tariffs it had imposed on US agricultural goods in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combined rate threatens to all but end the agricultural trade between the two countries. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday condemned US Vice President JD Vance as "ignorant and impolite", after he referred to Washington borrowing money from "Chinese peasants".
 <br>
  <br>
  "China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs that have raised the spectre of an international recession but ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended those tariffs as an antidote to a "globalist economy" that he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture," the vice president said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the United States, rather than making goods abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  But most economists question that and say his tariffs are arbitrary. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump will find it extremely hard to get China and Europe to consent to a devaluation for the greenback after antagonising them with his tariffs' move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A level of methane high enough to potentially ignite a fire was detected at the World Expo site in Japan, organisers said on Monday, less than a week before the event opens.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas was detected at an underground pit for electrical equipment during a test opening of the venue, said the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers in the western city of Osaka barred people from coming near the affected area for about an hour to ventilate it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The site of Expo 2025, which opens on Sunday, was once a landfill. Discarded household waste creates large amounts of methane when it decomposes if left to rot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although organisers have previously taken steps to prevent the gas from being trapped, they vowed on Monday to increase the frequency of monitoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fence will be installed so that visitors will not come near the affected area, while ventilation will also be improved, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, a restroom at the venue under construction caught fire after a spark from welding work triggered an explosion due to methane trapped there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expo 2025 will run for six months, involving around 160 countries and regions for a display of their technological and cultural prowess. (AFP)

 China on Monday accused the US of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying with tariffs, while calling on representatives of American companies including Tesla to “take concrete actions” to resolve the tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Putting “America First” over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US is seeking hegemony in the name of reciprocity, sacrificing the legitimate interests of all countries to serve its own selfish interests, and prioritising the US over international rules," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is typical unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The abuse of tariffs by the United States is tantamount to depriving countries, especially those in the Global South, of their right to development," Lin added, citing a widening gap between the rich and poor in each country, and less developed countries suffering a greater impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said all countries should uphold consultation, joint construction and sharing, and "genuine multilateralism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged countries to jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and safeguard the international system and the multilateral trading system according to the United Nations and World Trade Organization values respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump put an additional 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods as part of “Liberation Day,” coming on top of two rounds of 10 percent tariffs already declared in February and March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China and other governments retaliated quickly. Beijing announced its own 34 percent tariff rate on US goods, mirroring Trump's tariff rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sky won’t fall,” the People's Daily said, even if the US tariffs have an impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Faced with the indiscriminate punches of US taxes, we know what we are doing and we have tools at our disposal." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Saturday "the market has spoken" in rejecting US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and called on Washington for "equal-footed consultation" after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xinhua news agency also published the central government's stance, saying the US should "stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has spoken," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in a post on Facebook on Saturday. He also posted a picture capturing Friday's falls on US stock markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump introduced additional 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also closed a trade loophole that had allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  This prompted retaliation from China on Friday, including extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods and export curbs on some rare earths, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global stock markets plummeted following China's retaliation and Trump's comments on Friday that he would not change course, extending sharp losses that followed Trump's initial tariff announcement earlier in the week and marking the biggest losses since the pandemic. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now is the time for the US to stop doing the wrong things and resolve the differences with trading partners through equal-footed consultation," Guo wrote in English on Facebook.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a separate statement published by the Xinhua news agency, the central government urged the US: "Stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people."
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests," said the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington "seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, and seriously undermines the stability of the global economic order," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Saturday, several industry chambers of commerce ranging from those representing traders in metals and textiles to electronics, issued statements condemning the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's chamber of commerce, representing traders in food products, called on "China's food and agricultural products import and export industry to unite and strengthen cooperation to jointly explore domestic and foreign markets." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday announced the imposition of tariffs of 34 percent on all goods from the United States, as a countermeasure to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  US president Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports. That was on top of the existing tariff of 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said the countermeasure will be effective from April 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ministry of Commerce, meanwhile, said China has filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO), following the US slapping of what it called "reciprocal tariffs" on its trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A spokesperson said the move by the US seriously violated WTO rules and damaged the legitimate rights of WTO members, slamming the US for endangering the stability of the global economic and trade order.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ministry also said it had decided to add 11 US firms to its unreliable entity list, with immediate effect, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also announced controls on the export of seven rare earths, with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the nation's General Administration of Customs announced the suspension of import qualifications for six US companies. (Agencies)
