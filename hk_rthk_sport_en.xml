  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   LeBron and Bronny became the first father and son to play in the NBA together on Tuesday night during the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener, fulfilling a dream set out a few years ago by LeBron, the top scorer in league history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, it’s a moment I’m never going to forget,” LeBron said. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Father and son checked into the game against Minnesota simultaneously with four minutes left in the second quarter, prompting a big ovation from a home crowd aware of the enormity of the milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old LeBron had already started the game and played 13 minutes before he teamed up with his 20-year-old son for about 2 and a half minutes of action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James is a four-time champion and 20-time All-Star, while LeBron James Jr was a second-round pick by the Lakers last summer. They are the first father and son to play in the world's top basketball league at the same time, let alone on the same team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Y’all ready? You see the intensity, right? Just play carefree, though,” father told son on the bench before they checked in, an exchange captured by the TNT cameras and microphones. “Don’t worry about mistakes. Just go out and play hard.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron contributed 16 points in the Lakers' 110-103 win. Meanwhile, Bronny had an early offensive rebound and missed a tip-in, and his first NBA jump shot moments later was a 3-pointer that came up just short.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He – who, like many first-year players, is not expected to see significant floor time this season – checked out one possession later with 1:19 left in the second quarter, getting another ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “(I) tried not to focus on everything that’s going on around me, and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny said. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. The dream became real after Bronny entered the draft as a teenager following one collegiate season, and the Lakers grabbed him with the 55th overall pick. (AP/Reuters)

    Emma Raducanu becomes latest to pull out of HK Open

  <img alt="Emma Raducanu has already missed four tournaments on the WTA's Asian Tour.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Wednesday announced that former US Open champion Emma Raducanu will not take part in the tournament, a development that comes on the heels of star player Naomi Osaka's decision to drop out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two of the big names out, organisers stressed there will still be an "incredible line-up of marquee stars" at the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that top players – including defending champion Leylah Fernandez, former world number one Simona Halep, and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun – will be taking part in the event which runs from October 26 to November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong China Tennis Association said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Raducanu will not be participating in the all-female tournament and wished her a speedy recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, and we do hope that she will be back competing as soon as possible," the statement added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's decision comes after four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Briton continues to rehab from a foot injury she sustained in the quarter-finals of the Korea Open in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m sorry to say that I will not be able to play in Hong Kong next week," Raducanu said in a statement through the association. "While my foot is making good progress, I need a little more time before I am match fit," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's spot in the draw has since been filled by 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin.

    Celtics trounce Knicks to begin NBA title defence

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jayson Tatum scored 37 points as the Boston Celtics launched the defence of their NBA crown with an emphatic 132-109 defeat of the New York Knicks on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a triumphant pre-game ceremony that saw Boston celebrate raising their record-breaking 18th championship banner, the Celtics delivered a performance that suggested they could well be the team to beat once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A devastating 43-point first quarter put Boston in complete control during the first half, with Tatum producing an electric shooting performance to pour in 18 points from three-point range over the two quarters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum had brought the house down in a pre-game address to a packed TD Garden, signalling the Celtics' determination to win back-to-back championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is special. On behalf of me, my teammates, the organisation, we couldn't have done it without you last year," Tatum told the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let's enjoy this moment together," he added. "I can honestly say, to the best fans in the world – let's do it again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boston powered to last season's NBA championship after winning 64 games in the regular season before dropping just three games in the playoffs, sealing victory with a 4-1 rout of the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That win came after years of frustrating postseason disappointments, which included a 4-2 defeat to Golden State in the 2022 NBA Finals and an agonising 4-3 loss to Miami in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Celtics have retained the core of the team from last season's roster and look well-positioned to mount a serious defence of their title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against New York on Tuesday, Joe Mazzulla's team picked up where they had left off in June, with all of their heavy-hitters coming up big to leave the Knicks chasing the game for long periods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four of the their five starters – Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday – posted double-digit points tallies before half-time, helping the team take a commanding 74-55 lead into the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Knicks had enjoyed parity in a 31-31 second quarter, the Celtics were in no mood to let their advantage slip after the break, coasting home to close out the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum finished with 10 assists and four rebounds in addition to his 37 points, with White adding 24 points and Brown 23. Holiday added 18 while Al Horford chipped in with 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Brunson led the Knicks scoring with 22 points, alongside Miles McBride with 22 from the bench. (AFP)

    Aston Villa beat Bologna, go top of Champions League

  <img alt="Aston Villa's John McGinn with teammate Jhon Duran. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775757_1_20241023081956.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Uefa Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't want to stop here – it puts us in a great position," said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we are building here is amazing," he added. "This is home for me – it is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to "break barriers" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything," said Emery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season. (AFP)

    Glasgow named host for 2026 Commonwealth Games

  <img alt="Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) CEO Katie Sadleir. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775755_1_20241023081604.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The future of the 2026 Games was thrown into doubt when the Australian state of Victoria, the original hosts, withdrew last year, citing rising costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Scottish government effectively gave the green light to Glasgow last month and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Tuesday that the 2014 hosts will stage the next Games, from July 23 to August 2, 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Games will feature just 10 sports compared with the 19 on show at the 2022 edition in the English city of Birmingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Para sport will once again be fully integrated as "a key priority and point of difference for the Games", with six para sports included on the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The schedule will feature athletics and para athletics, swimming and para swimming, artistic gymnastics, track cycling and para track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para bowls, as well as 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the sports missing out compared to the 2022 Games are triathlon, diving, hockey, T20 cricket, squash, badminton and rugby sevens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 3,000 athletes are expected to compete from up to 74 Commonwealth nations and territories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CGF said Glasgow 2026 would deliver more than US$130 million of inward investment into the city, with no need for public funding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia will provide part of the finance after Victoria pulled out, citing a projected cost of more than US$4 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On behalf of the entire Commonwealth sport movement, we are delighted to officially confirm that the 2026 Commonwealth Games will take place in the host city of Glasgow," said CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commonwealth Games, held every four years, evolved out of the British Empire Games and is still made up mainly of countries and territories once subject to British imperial rule. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Uefa Champions League on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their "standards slip" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta had urged his players to use the "pain" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tiger Woods is expected to make his TGL debut on January 14, the new tech-infused indoor team golf league announced on Monday, along with the full schedule for its inaugural season that will be held entirely in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 15-time major champion's first potential match will come in the second week of the season.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today," Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level," the Portuguese boss added. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka said on Monday she hopes to stay at the top of the world rankings a little longer than last time after returning to the number one WTA spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old jumped above Poland's French Open champion Iga Swiatek thanks to year-end adjustments in the standings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This season's US and Australian Open champion Sabalenka spent just eight weeks at the top of the rankings in September 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "N1...," she said on X, formerly Twitter. "Let's see for how long this time," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has lost just one match since mid-August in a run which included her success at Flushing Meadows and her next tournament could be the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia on November 2 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swiatek, who won her third straight Roland Garros title in June, had held the top ranking since late last year. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tommy Edman and Will Smith homered to send Shohei Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Los Angeles Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers took the best-of-seven National League Championship Series 4-2 over the Mets and will open the World Series at home on Friday against the New York Yankees, who own a record 27 titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This will be the Dodgers' 22nd World Series –13th in Los Angeles – and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. Game 1 is Friday at Dodger Stadium, pitting New York slugger Aaron Judge and Ohtani – MLB's top home-run hitters this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,” Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. “It’s going to be a battle of two good teams – a lot of long flights across the country.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’ll be the 12th time the storied franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,” Ohtani said through a translator, “and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record-breaking contract in free agency, had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Not bad for his first postseason after spending six years with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers eliminated the Mets on their second try in the series. They outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. None of the games were close, with the Dodgers earning two shutouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, meanwhile, came within two wins of reaching the World Series after a 22-33 start. (AFP/AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey bagged two golds and a bronze to conclude the first stop of the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Olympic medallist won her first medal of the competition on Saturday in the women's 200 metres freestyle, with a time of 1 minute 51.46 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey, who won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics, brought more good news on the final day in Shanghai by winning a bronze in the 50 metres breaststroke, followed by a gold in the 100 metres freestyle only 15 minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She came third in the breaststroke event after finishing with a time of 29.74 seconds – behind China's Tang Qianting and Benedetta Pilato of Italy – to create a new Hong Kong record, and dominated the freestyle event by leading from start to finish, ending with a time of 51.89 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second leg of the World Cup will be held in Incheon, South Korea from October 24-26, while the last stop will be in Singapore from October 31 to November 2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The World Cup is a qualifying event for the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest at the end of the year.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Liberty won the 2024 WNBA championship after beating the Minnesota Lynx 67-62 in overtime of a decisive Game 5 on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jonquel Jones scored 17 points to lead New York, which was one of the original franchises in the league. The Liberty made the WNBA Finals five times before, losing each one, including last season. This time they wouldn’t be denied, although it took an extra five minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gave the city of New York its first basketball title since 1973 when the Knicks won the NBA championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu struggling on offense, other players stepped up. Leonie Fiebich started off overtime with a 3-pointer, and then Nyara Sabally had a steal for a layup to make it 65-60 and bring the sellout crowd to a frenzied state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota didn’t score in overtime until Kayla McBride hit two free throws with just under two minutes left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx missed all six of their field goal attempts in overtime. After Ionescu missed a shot with 21 seconds left, her 18th miss on 19 shot attempts, the Lynx had one last chance, but Bridget Carleton missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stewart, who missed a free throw with 0.8 seconds left in Game 1, hit two free throws with 10.1 seconds left to seal the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the players hugged and streamers fell from the rafters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Napheesa Collier scored 22 points to lead Minnesota before fouling out with 13 seconds left in overtime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx were trying for a record fifth WNBA title, breaking a tie with the Seattle Storm and Houston Comets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota won four titles from 2011 to 2017 behind the core group of Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Sylvia Fowles and Maya Moore. That was the team’s last appearance in the WNBA Finals until this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is the first time since 2019 that the WNBA Finals have gone the distance. Since the league switched to a best-of-five format in 2005, seven other series have gone to a Game 5 and the home team has won five of those contests, including in 2019. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An outstanding all-round performance by Amelia Kerr led New Zealand to their first ever Women's T20 World Cup title as they beat South Africa by a commanding 32 runs in Sunday's final in Dubai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Player of the Match Kerr top-scored with 43 as New Zealand posted an imposing 158-5 in their 20 overs before taking 3-24, and crucially picking up the key wickets of Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch, to restrict South Africa to 126-9 in their 20 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marked a sweet finish to skipper Sophie Devine's career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The victory came 14 years after the White Ferns lost to Australia by just three runs in the 2010 final. They also lost to England in the 2009 championship match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For South Africa it made for a double disappointment having lost last year's final to Australia in Cape Town. (AFP)

   Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race," said Leclerc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer," Verstappen, meanwhile, said after the race. "It was a tough battle and tough to keep Norris behind, but it's a great result."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City snatched a controversial 2-1 win at Wolves as John Stones' last-gasp goal was given after a VAR review to send the champions to the top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pep Guardiola's side trailed to Jorgen Strand Larsen's surprise opener for Wolves early in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol dragged City back on level terms before the interval and, with just seconds left in stoppage time, Stones headed the visitors to a dramatic sixth win in eight league games this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bottom-of-the-table Wolves claimed Stones' goal should have been disallowed for offside and interference by Bernardo Silva on goalkeeper Jose Sa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm trying to remain calm," Wolves boss Gary O'Neil said. "I have been involved in a few of those and not had many go in our favour."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is some grey area that can go either way and once it was like that I wasn't confident it would go our way," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are a point clear of previous leaders Liverpool, who reclaimed pole position with a victory against Chelsea on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chasing a fifth successive English title, Guardiola's men have set a new club record as their unbeaten run in the league reached 31 games since their loss to Aston Villa in December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In English top-flight history, only six times has a side gone more than 30 matches without losing, most recently Liverpool's run of 44 games from 2019 to 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are not used to winning games at the end, like Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool it many times happened. It is a good flavour for us," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 or 12 games in the Premier League you don't have to see the table, it is just the beginning," Guardioloa added. "But of course it is nice to be winning, you are alive and in that position." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the world's two highest ranked players, brings out the best in both, Sinner said on Saturday after beating Alcaraz in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner, who won 6-7(5) 6-3 6-3 to bag the US$6 million title, said he hoped for a long rivalry with Alcaraz, after Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced off for the final time in the third-place match earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wake up in the morning trying to understand the ways how to beat him. This kind of rivalries, this kind of players, they push us always to our 100 percent," world number one Sinner said in a post-match interview.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hopefully this rivalry will last as long as possible. But there are so many other great players who can jump in – let's see what's coming in the future," the 23-year-old said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy's Sinner and Spain's Alcaraz have won two Grand Slams each this year, with Alcaraz beating Sinner in closely fought clashes at the French Open semi-finals and the China Open final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The off-the-court friends have played each other 10 times on the ATP tour, with 21-year-old Alcaraz winning six matches, including the last three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will do everything so that this rivalry gets better and better – I am happy to share the court with him," four-times Grand Slam winner Alcaraz said. (Reuters)

    Liverpool beat Chelsea, claim top Premier League spot

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arne Slot said Liverpool rose to the challenge posed by a step up in opposition after beating Chelsea 2-1 to move back top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Reds had not faced any of the top nine in the table in their opening seven league games of the season to give Slot a gentle start to the demanding task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool did not have things all their own way at Anfield, but ground out another victory thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' second-half winner after Nicolas Jackson brought Chelsea level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The better the teams you face the more you need to fight," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It helps if you play against a Chelsea, it is a big game and everyone feels it," he added. "We felt it and the fans felt it because they were there for us today. We showed up, that was the most important thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit of a confident Chelsea side kicked off a daunting run for Slot's men in the coming months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool face Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Manchester City in four of their next five Premier League games, as well as Champions League ties against RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid before the end of November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is our biggest test, to play Champions League and Premier League, the hardest games, three days in a row," added Slot. "Many other games were hard but this might have been the hardest maybe because of the amount of quality players they have and the structure they have."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defeat for Chelsea was their first in the league since Enzo Maresca's debut as coach against Manchester City on the opening weekend of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there were plenty of positives for Maresca as the Blues were a different animal to the side that were thrashed 4-1 on their last visit to Anfield in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't like to drop points and lose a game, but if you have to choose a way, this is the way," said Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We came here and tried to control the game. For most of the game we played in their half and I thought the performance was fantastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I came here many times in the past and I know how difficult it is but the way we controlled and managed the game was fantastic," he added. "This is the right direction." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Baseball’s biggest brand is going back to October’s main stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Juan Soto hit a three-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning and the New York Yankees advanced to their 41st World Series – and first in 15 years – by beating the Cleveland Guardians 5-2 in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) on Saturday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto, who was acquired in a seven-player trade with San Diego in December, moved the Bronx Bombers into position with one big swing. He also caught the final out of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’re right where we belong,” said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who pulled off the deal for Soto.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to win their 28th title against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers. Game 6 of the National League Championship Series is on Sunday at Dodger Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 10th, Austin Wells walked with one out and Alex Verdugo followed with a grounder to second baseman Andrés Giménez, whose soft toss to the bag was dropped by rookie shortstop Brayan Rocchio for an error.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland reliever Hunter Gaddis struck out Gleyber Torres and had Soto in a 1-2 count before New York’s stylish outfielder sent a shot over the wall in centre. Soto danced down the first-base line and paused to celebrate with his teammates before circling the bases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was just saying to myself, `You’re all over that guy. You’re all over that guy. He ain’t got anything,’” said Soto, who moved alongside his manager, Aaron Boone, as the only New York players to homer in an extra-inning, series-clinching win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto is eligible for free agency this winter, and Yankees fans chanted “Re-sign Soto!” during the post-game festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer and was named ALCS MVP as the Yankees took care of the Guardians in five games. It wasn’t easy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York won the first two at Yankee Stadium without much fanfare or any major drama. However, it was a different story in Cleveland as all three games at Progressive Field were nail-biters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians rallied to win Game 3 on two, two-run homers in their last two at-bats, and the Yankees held on to win Game 4 after blowing a four-run lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This was a roller coaster and we were able to just keep punching back,” Stanton said. “We know there’s much more work to do and it’s only uphill from here and we got to get it done.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland just didn’t have enough and a surprising season under first-year manager Stephen Vogt ended just short of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The franchise remains without a title since 1948, baseball’s current longest drought. (AP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory over Ineos Britannia on Saturday to defend the America's Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating their British opponents by 37 seconds in the ninth race off Barcelona to end the best-of-13 series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand raced into a 4-0 lead in the 37th edition of the competition before Britain fought back with two victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However the Kiwis responded with three points in a row to clinch a third straight victory after their successes in 2017 and 2021, the country's fifth triumph in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What an amazing feeling, it's been a tough battle all week, but an amazing scoreline and I'm proud of the way the team kept battling today," said Kiwi helmsman Peter Burling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's still just sinking in... what an awesome day, Barcelona's just been absolutely amazing, what an amazing feeling."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ninth race was delayed by 40 minutes because of light wind conditions but eventually began with Ineos knowing they needed to win five straight races to lift the trophy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British boat crossed the start line a knot faster than their opponents and the teams exchanged the lead until New Zealand pulled ahead by 200 metres at the first gate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kiwis extended their lead to 22 seconds by the second mark but Ineos continued to fight relentlessly and cut the gap to 69 metres at one point in the fourth leg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The right side of the course offered higher pressure and New Zealand did a good job of defending it, denying Britain a way back in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Skipper Ben Ainslie and Ineos, bankrolled by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, needed a miracle like the comeback from 8-1 down to win Oracle Team USA the America's Cup in 2013, but it was not forthcoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Britain have still never won the competition which started 173 years ago with a race around the Isle of Wight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team, and in my view they are the best team ever in the America's Cup," said Ainslie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day the better team won.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is not going to be the end of the journey for us, we set out 10 years ago to win the America's Cup, we're getting closer each time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The trick is to keep going and get it home the next time." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Mets kept their magical season going, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-6 on Friday to stay alive in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pete Alonso hit a three-run home run in the first inning and the Mets piled up five runs in the third on the way to an 8-1 lead, then held on to cut the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers, who were hoping to close out the series at the Mets' Citi Field, instead will host game six on Sunday, again with a chance to return to the World Series for the first time since they won it all in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We'll be ready," Alonso vowed. "We love opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Andy Pages homered twice for the Dodgers, including a three-run blast that cut New York's lead to 10-5 in the fifth inning. Mookie Betts's solo homer in the sixth pulled the Dodgers within four, but the Mets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte belted three doubles, driving in three runs on four hits for New York. Francisco Lindor and Jesse Winker both plated runs with triples for the Mets, who had 14 hits with no strikeouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will take on either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, with a three-run homer from Giancarlo Stanton and a tie-breaking pair of runs in the top of the ninth, beat the Guardians 8-6 to take a 3-1 stranglehold on the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, with their backs against the wall, came out firing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They seized a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Alonso's towering home run to center field that also scored Lindor and Brandon Nimmo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pulled a run back with two out in the second when Enrique Hernandez raced home on a wild pitch from Mets hurler David Peterson to Shohei Ohtani.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Mets poured it on in the third when Marte made Dodgers starting pitcher Jack Flaherty pay for walking Alonso and Winker to open the frame, belting a double up the left field line that scored both.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty retired two batters before the Mets put together three straight run-scoring hits to make it 8-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Peterson surrendered a solo home run to Pages in the fourth as the Dodgers continued to press, but the Mets pushed their lead to 10-2 with a pair of runs in the bottom of the fourth and Los Angeles could never close the gap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Cleveland, Stanton crushed his fourth home run of this post-season to power the Yankees, hammering a three-run blast off Guardians relief pitcher Cade Smith to put them up 6-2 in the sixth inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smith had walked Juan Soto to open the inning. Yankees slugger Aaron Judge cranked a single before a sacrifice bunt from Jazz Chisholm brought up Stanton, who launched a fastball 404 feet into the left field seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, stunned by the Guardians' come-from-behind game three victory on Thursday, wasted no time, taking a 2-0 lead in the top of the first on Soto's two-run homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin Wells also homered for the Yankees, but the Guardians scored three runs in the seventh inning to pull within 6-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland tied it at 6-6 in the eighth when David Fry's soft infield hit was fielded clumsily by Yankees pitcher Mark Leiter, whose toss got past first baseman Anthony Rizzo to allow Fry to second as Bo Naylor – who opened the inning with a double – scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, trying to return to the World Series for the first time since winning their record 27th title in 2009, pushed across two runs in the top of the ninth against Cleveland's star closer Emmanuel Clase and held on for the win.

   They can finish off the series with a victory in game five on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The key is to go play one more game – go out there and try to win that game," Soto said. "Forget about the series, just try to go out there and win the game ... that's all we need to do." (AFP)

    Rugby to trial 20-minute red cards in November Tests

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Referees will have the option of awarding 20-minute red cards for technical offences during the Autumn Nations Series, organisers announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sport's global governing body World Rugby trialled the change in the Rugby Championship earlier this year, allowing a team to replace a red-carded player after 20 minutes in the sin-bin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Importantly for the Autumn Tests, which pitch southern hemisphere teams against those from the north, match officials will also retain the ability to award a permanent red card for acts of foul play which are deemed deliberate and dangerous.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The red card variation ensures that players deemed to commit deliberate and dangerous offences receive the full sanctioning, and subsequent disciplinary process, with the team being reduced to 14 men for the remainder of the game," Six Nations Rugby said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Referees will have the option to award a 20-minute red card for technical offences. This variation on the law trial will run throughout the Autumn Nation Series and differs to the standalone 20-minute red card proposal due to be discussed by the wider game later this year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   National unions in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand back the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there are others who oppose it, notably France and Ireland. The latter country's union said on Friday it did "not support the permanent adoption of a 20-minute red card," as proposed by World Rugby.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Player welfare and safety are paramount to the core values of the game and the option of a permanent red card for deliberate and intentional acts of foul play supports those values and protects the integrity of the game," the Irish union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The IRFU welcomes the variation to World Rugby's closed law trial," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other law trials on show in November include kickers having just 60 seconds to complete a penalty or a conversion, the latter with a countdown starting straight after a try is scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If a player exceeds this time limit, the conversion kick will be disallowed, while for a penalty, a scrum is awarded to the non-kicking team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will also be a scrum and line-out clock, with the set-pieces to be formed within 30 seconds of the referee and assistant officials making the respective mark. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mookie Betts homered and finished with four hits and four RBIs for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who took control of the National League Championship Series with a 10-2 win over the New York Mets in Game 4 on Thursday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers lead the best-of-seven series 3-1 and will attempt to clinch the pennant and a trip to the World Series on Friday afternoon, when the teams are scheduled to play Game 5 in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, who will be playing an elimination game for the second time this month, have been outscored 30-9 in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani homered on the second pitch of the game and walked in each of his next three plate appearances – all of which led to rally-extending hits by Betts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former American League MVP singled and later scored the final run of a two-run third-inning rally before lacing a two-run double in the fourth to extend the Dodgers' lead to 5-2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts added insurance in the sixth, when he greeted Phil Maton with a homer to left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tommy Edman put the Dodgers ahead for good with a two-out RBI double in the third. Enrique Hernandez followed with a run-scoring single. Edman had a two-run double in the eighth, when Will Smith added an RBI single.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Max Muncy, who started at first base with Freddie Freeman out due to a sore right ankle, walked in his first three plate appearances before singling in the seventh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the 12th straight plate appearance in which he had reached base, tying Reggie Jackson's postseason record. Muncy struck out in the eighth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Evan Phillips, the second of four Dodgers pitchers, earned the win by tossing 1 1/3 scoreless innings. He relieved starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who gave up two runs on four hits and one walk while striking out eight over 4 2/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mark Vientos homered in the first inning and Brandon Nimmo legged out the back end of a potential double-play grounder in the third inning for the Mets, who finished 4-for-22 with runners on base and left the bases loaded twice. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cleveland's David Fry smashed the game-winning home run in the 10th inning on Thursday to give the Guardians a dramatic 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Thursday in the Major League Baseball playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians, one out from defeat, made a stunning fightback to pull within 2-1 of the Yankees in the in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, which continues Friday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When everybody thinks we can't do it, we think we can," Fry said. "What a win. That was so good – it was fun."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ALCS winner will play in the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers, who meet later Thursday in game four of the National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning and New York added an insurance run in the ninth for a 5-3 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But in the bottom of the ninth with the hosts down to their final out, Cleveland pinch-hitter Jhonkensy Noel smashed a two-run homer into the left-field stands, the Dominican rookie lifting the Guardians level 5-5 to force extra innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York stranded two base runners in the top of the 10th, setting the stage for Cleveland's walk-off win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bo Naylor singled and took second base on Brayan Rocchio's sacrifice bunt before Fry smashed the game-winning homer off Yankees relief pitcher Clay Holmes over the left-field wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not many times do I know the ball has left here to left field, but I had a really good feeling," Fry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Amazing. I still don't know what happened but it ended up we won," he added. "It's so awesome, it's surreal. We've got a lot more to do, though, but it was fun tonight."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to recover from the near-miss for game four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They scratched and clawed their way back in," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Sucks losing like that, but we'll be ready to roll tomorrow."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not reached the World Series since winning their record 27th title in 2009 while Cleveland , which last reached the World Series in 2016, has not captured the crown since 1948. (AFP)

    Alcaraz defeats Nadal in Six Kings semi-finals

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal admitted his fitness level was well off the tour's top players after falling Thursday in straight sets to fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who described the exhibition match as "a little bit sad".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Nadal, who announced last week he would retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month, lost 6-3, 6-3 to 21-year-old Alcaraz in the semi-finals of the "Six Kings Slam" event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afterwards he described Alcaraz, winner of the French Open and Wimbledon this year, as an "animal" and acknowledged he was not competing at the highest level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have not much pressure here. I'm just trying to have fun," he told a post-match press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know I'm going to play against players that – are in much better shape than me because they are on the professional tour and winning tournaments."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz said he knew the Saudi crowd was against him but wanted to let Nadal, winner of 22 Grand Slams including 14 French Open titles, bask in the support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a little bit sad – it was not a really comfortable moment for me. Obviously I really wanted to win," said Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once you step on the court it's no friends, no idols" but "I think this is his moment right now," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to Thursday's match Nadal had made his last singles appearance at the Olympic Games in Paris where his campaign was cut short by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had also teamed-up with Alcaraz in men's doubles at the Games and may reprise that role at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal will play Djokovic again on Saturday after the Serbian great lost a much tighter match to Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner, who prevailed 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 and will take on Alcaraz in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having Novak in front, it's like a nostalgic thing," Nadal said, looking ahead to their battle for third place in the Saudi exhibition. "We faced each other plenty of times, so it's going to be good fun to play each other again one more time in this match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for the Davis Cup Finals next month, Nadal said he was unclear what his form would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Emotionally I'm sure I will be ready. In terms of physically, in terms of tennis level – there's still a month to prepare," he said, adding that he would not hesitate to speak up if he thought he could not compete well in singles. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Skipper Rohit Sharma on Thursday said he was "hurting" after opting to bat first on a seaming pitch as hosts India fell to a dismal 46 all out against New Zealand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kiwi fast bowlers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke wreaked havoc in overcast conditions to dismiss India in 31.2 overs on the first Test's second afternoon in Bengaluru.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was India's third-lowest Test score ever and lowest at home, worse than their 75 against the West Indies in New Delhi in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their lowest overall is 36 against Australia in a pink-ball Adelaide Test in 2020. They fell for 42 against England at Lord's in 1974.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We felt there was not much grass on the pitch and it will do whatever it has to do in the first couple of sessions and then it is going to take a turn as the game goes on," Rohit told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expected the wicket to be flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly misjudgement of the pitch," he added. "Obviously, I didn't read the pitch enough and we sit in that situation today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five Indian batsmen including Virat Kohli got out for a duck as Henry and O'Rourke shared nine wickets between them in a rare show of domination by opposition bowlers in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am hurting a little bit because I made that call," said Rohit. "But we want to challenge ourselves. This time it didn't come off, the challenge that was thrown at us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former captain Tim Southee drew first blood as he bowled Rohit through the gate. Fellow quick O'Rourke silenced the crowd when he sent back Kohli for nought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry wrapped up the innings with a five-wicket haul and his last strike of Kuldeep Yadav was his 100th Test wicket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a good toss to lose," said Henry. "It was quite nice when those clouds started coming in. I think we were expecting it to be a flatter wicket but there was plenty of assistance this morning – it was great that we could make the most of it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have the upper hand with a lead of 134 as they ended the day on 180-3 after Devon Conway's 91. Henry warned his team against letting their guard down.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can't be complacent at all," he said. "We've just got to keep mounting pressure." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A superb 74 not out from Anneke Bosch fired South Africa into the Women's T20 World Cup final as they demolished defending champions Australia by eight wickets in Dubai on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Set 135 to win, South Africa reached their target with 16 balls to spare, with Bosch, who struck eight fours and a six in her 48-ball innings, sharing a match-winning partnership of 96 with skipper Laura Wolvaardt (42).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Sunday's final, which will be the first not to feature one of Australia or England, the South Africans will face either West Indies or New Zealand who meet in the second semi-final on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia, who have won six of the previous eight editions, had been the odds-on favourites to win a seventh title in the United Arab Emirates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they had no answer to South Africa for whom this marked a measure of revenge for defeat by Australia in last year's final in Cape Town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think this is one of the best wins of my cricketing career for sure. A couple of other girls have said it as well," said Wolvaardt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that was such an amazing chase," she added. "The bowlers are excellent. It's been a good year for us – I think it's been a real collective group effort." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Formula One is scrapping from next year the award of a bonus point for fastest lap in a race, introduced with much fanfare just five years ago, governing body the FIA said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bonus point was awarded originally in the 1950s, but then dropped before being reintroduced in 2019 for the lap, if the driver finishes in the top ten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has potential significance in a long season of 24 races, as this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FIA (International Motoring Federation) made the announcement ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix among changes to the 2024 and 2025 sporting and technical regulations after approval by the World Motor Sport Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another change, a requirement to run a young driver during free practice is to increase from once per car per season to twice per car per season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The significance of the fastest lap was shown at last month's Singapore Grand Prix where RB's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo pitted for new tyres to set the fastest lap in his final race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RB are a sister team to Red Bull and thereby deprived rivals like McLaren and their title-challenging driver Lando Norris of a possible additional point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris held the fastest lap and bonus point as the race entered its final laps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ricciardo was 18th and not eligible to score a bonus point, but he was called to pit and duly set the lap, depriving Norris of a point. (AFP)

    Alcaraz to face Nadal in Six Kings Slam semis

  <img alt="Alcaraz in action against Denmark's Holger Rune at the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774910_1_20241017082310.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Alcaraz admitted Wednesday it will be a "difficult moment" facing "idol" Rafael Nadal when the Spanish superstars clash for the final time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, announced last week that he will retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, however, the 38-year-old will take on Alcaraz for a place in the final of the "Six Kings Slam" exhibition event in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since I started to play tennis, I'm watching his matches. I look up to him and I grew up watching him. He was my idol, he is still my idol," Alcaraz said on court after defeating Holger Rune 6-4, 6-2 to set-up an emotional meeting with Nadal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A really important person for my life, for my career and he was one of the reasons that I wanted to become a professional tennis player. Knowing he is going to retire is pretty tough for everyone, for me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, added: "I will try to enjoy sharing the court with him once again, but I think it is really difficult for everyone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal and Alcaraz have met three times on the main ATP Tour with the soon-to-be retired veteran holding a 2-1 advantage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spanish pair played doubles together at the Paris Olympics this year and they are expected to team-up again at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal also made his last singles appearance at the Games on the same Roland Garros courts where he won 14 French Open titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His Olympic singles campaign was ended by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's other semi-final in Riyadh sees Djokovic tackle Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number one Sinner eased past Daniil Medvedev 6-0, 6-3 on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The semi-final against Novak will be a different match than the ones we played in the past," said Sinner who defeated the 24-time Grand Slam title winner in the Shanghai Masters final last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We know each other quite well and we know what to expect from each other," the 23-year-old added. "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I am just trying to play the best possible tennis, and we will see how it goes." (AFP)

    Pogba 'willing to give up money' to stay at Juventus

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774908_2_20241017081740.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paul Pogba is adamant that he wishes to return from his reduced doping ban with Juventus even if it means accepting a pay cut, the French World Cup winner told La Gazzetta dello Sport in an interview Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm willing to give up money to be able to play again with Juve, I want to come back with this club," said Pogba in an interview published on the Italian sports daily's website. "The reality is that I am a Juve player and I am preparing to play for Juve."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's contract with the Italian giants expires in June 2026 and is currently worth US$8.6 million a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his ongoing suspension, the midfielder receives only the minimum salary stipulated in the Serie A collective agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, since Pogba's ban was reduced, Italian press have reported that Juventus are nonetheless seeking to terminate his contract.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will be a new Pogba, a hungrier, wiser and stronger one – I just want to play football," added the former Manchester United star.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to be ready to train and play for Juve, I'm a Juve player," he added. "In my mind, that's all there is at the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba had his four-year ban for doping reduced to 18 months earlier in October by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and can return to action from March 11 next year, four days before his 32nd birthday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 after a match between Juventus and Udinese in Italy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was provisionally suspended in September of the same year, and then banned for four years by the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal the following February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's representatives said the testosterone came from a food supplement prescribed by a doctor he consulted in the United States. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aaron Judge smacked his first home run of the Major League Baseball playoffs and the New York Yankees beat Cleveland 6-3 on Tuesday, seizing command of the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge broke open a tight game with his two-run blast in the seventh inning as the Yankees grabbed a 2-0 lead in the best-of seven series, which continues on Thursday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got to keep things the same," Judge said. "It's going to be a loud environment, a fun environment. We've got to go out there and keep playing our game – feed off the energy and go from there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series winner advances to the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees slugger Judge, whose 58 regular-season homers led MLB, crushed a blast over the centerfield wall to give New York a 6-2 lead with his 14th career playoff homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was good to add two more runs there," Judge said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians stranded 11 base runners as four Yankees relief pitchers baffled Cleveland after starter Gerrit Cole went only 4 1/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These guys came in, they're healthy, they're feeling great, some great performances from quite a few guys at the back end," Judge said of New York's relievers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are seeking their first trip to the World Series since winning it for the record 27th time in 2009, while Cleveland has not reached the event since 2016 and last won a World Series in 1948. (AFP)

    Rape probe in Sweden after reports Mbappé is suspect

  <img alt="Swedish media on Tuesday reported that Mbappé was the target of a rape investigation. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=10&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774657_1_20241015233253.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Swedish prosecutor on Tuesday said – without mentioning Kylian Mbappé – that a rape investigation had been opened, after media reported that the Real Madrid and France star was the suspect during a visit to Stockholm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to media reports about a suspected rape in Stockholm, the prosecutor can confirm that a criminal report has been submitted to the police," Sweden's Prosecution Authority said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that the alleged incident occurred at a hotel on October 10, but did not name a suspect and said no further information could be shared for the moment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swedish newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen, as well as public broadcaster SVT, on Tuesday reported that 25-year-old Mbappé was the target of the investigation, following his two-day visit to the Swedish capital last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French international visited Stockholm with a group of people last Thursday, as he was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to Aftonbladet, the group dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub, and left Sweden last Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the complaint was filed last Saturday after the alleged victim had sought medical attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expressen reported on Tuesday that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, citing anonymous sources, Expressen identified Mbappé as the suspect, while Aftonbladet and SVT said on Tuesday they had also had obtained information confirming Mbappe was the suspect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Mbappé on Monday posted on X that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday, in his dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance," Mbappé said in the post.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mbappé claims he is owed US$60 million by the Qatari-owned French champions. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off. (AFP)

    Brady to become part-owner of NFL's Las Vegas Raiders

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady was approved as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders ownership group on Tuesday by NFL team owners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, who played 23 NFL seasons before retiring in 2022, will hold a 5 percent stake in the Raiders, who are off to a 2-4 start this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval at an owners meeting in Atlanta ends an 18-month saga since the first reports of Brady seeking a share of the partnership group that owns the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Delays in the deal reportedly included figuring out an exact percentage for Brady and issues around his current role as an NFL television analyst for Fox Sports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two months ago, the NFL put some restrictions on Brady's broadcast access because of his possible involvement with the Raiders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady is banned from attending in-person or online broadcast production meetings and is not allowed access to players, coaches or team facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While he is permitted to broadcast Raiders contests, Brady must follow NFL rules banning criticism of other teams or officials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, 47, spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, leading them to six NFL titles, and captured his last crown with Tampa Bay in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He set NFL career records with 7,753 completions from 12,050 attempts for 89,214 yards and 649 touchdowns. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The World Conker Championships said on Tuesday it was investigating allegations of cheating after this year's men’s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 200 enthusiasts of the traditional game entered the annual competition on Sunday in the small village of Southwick in central England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game involves players using conkers – the glossy brown seeds from the horse chestnut tree – threaded onto a string to try and smash their opponent’s chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each player takes three alternate strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Veteran player Dave Jakins, 82, won the men's tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But organisers said they launched an investigation after claims that he may have used a steel chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The allegations were raised by Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, who lost in the men’s final against Jakins after his conker “disintegrated in one hit," The Telegraph newspaper reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers confirmed a steel conker was found in Jakins' pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investigations were ongoing, but they said that it appeared unlikely that he was able to cheat under the scrutiny of judges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jakins has denied the allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “He was very closely watched by four judges. It looks like it was absolutely impossible for him to cheat,” St. John Burkett, chair of the event's organising committee, told Sky News.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The title of World Conker Champion went this year to Kelci Banschbach, originally from Indianapolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 34-year-old was crowned “queen conker” after beating Jakins in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was the first American to win the title since the World Conker Championships began in 1965. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Organisers on Tuesday confirmed that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will compete in the Hong Kong Open tennis championships later in October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Osaka, who won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020, is the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam and the first player from Asia to hold the singles' top ranking, claiming the World No. 1 spot in January 2019, which she held for 21 weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She will be joined by Russia's Diana Shnaider and Anastasia Potapova, who is ranked 37th in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-year-old Shnaider is the youngest player currently ranked in the world's top 16, and has won three titles this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the 2024 Olympic Games, she partnered with Mirra Andreeva to capture the silver medal in the women's doubles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other international stars already confirmed to compete in the event include defending champion Leylah Fernandez of Canada, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania and Britain's highest-ranked player Katie Boulter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's Paris Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Wang Xinyu, and rising stars Yuan Yue and Wang Xiyu will also feature in the field competing for a total prize purse worth US$250,000. (Xinhua)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Captain Ben Stokes was named in the England team for the second Test against Pakistan starting in Multan on Tuesday after recovering from a hamstring injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stokes suffered the injury two months ago and missed the three-match home series against Sri Lanka and last week's first Test, which the visitors won by an innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Durham seamer Matthew Potts also returns to the side for the first time since the Lord's Test against Sri Lanka at the end of August. Seamers Gus Atkinson and Chris Woakes are rested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Look, it's obviously got to be sensible," said talismanic all-rounder Stokes on Monday after he was declared fit, having been bowling in the nets since before the first Test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm obviously playing as a third seamer," he added. "I'm available to bowl and obviously when I sense the time is right for me to maybe come on and make an impact there won't be any doubts in my mind that I can come on and bowl."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England won the first Test, also in Multan, by an innings and 47 runs on Friday, with Ollie Pope leading the side in Stokes's absence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England rode on a brilliant 317 from Harry Brook and 262 from Joe Root for a stunning victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan became the first team in Test cricket's 147-year history to lose by an innings after posting a 550-plus total in their first knock. (AFP)

  <img alt="Vientos hit a four-run grand slam against the Dodgers in the second inning. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774532_1_20241015082523.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mark Vientos smashed a grand slam and Francisco Lindor homered as well as the New York Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 on Monday to level their Major League Baseball playoff series at one game apiece.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vientos's four-run home run in a determined second inning at-bat helped the Mets rebound from a 9-0 drubbing in game one on Sunday in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lindor led off the game with a 395-foot home run off Dodgers hurler Ryan Brasier, ending the Dodgers pitching staff's record-equalling streak of 33 scoreless innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers hurlers hadn't surrendered a run since the second inning of game three of their division series against the San Diego Padres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One inning later, Vientos got the better of Dodgers reliever Landon Knack, fouling off five pitches before crushing the ninth pitch he saw – a 95 mph fastball – over the center field seats for a grand slam home run that pushed the Mets' lead to 6-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte had opened the inning with a single off Knack and scored on Tyrone Taylor's double that left runners at second and third. Lindor was intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up Vientos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 24-year-old admitted he "took it personally" when the Dodgers walked Lindor to bring him to the plate but said he "wasn't trying to do too much."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets will host games three and four on Wednesday and Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we're in a great spot," Vientos said. "I like the momentum we got. I like the energy we brought in this day game and we've got to keep it going.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Max Muncy hit a solo homer for Los Angeles in the fifth, but the Dodgers' vaunted lineup was largely silenced. Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and two walks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will advance to the World Series against either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees, fueled by home runs from Giancarlo Stanton and Juan Soto, beat the Guardians 5-2 to open their American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland pitcher Alex Cobb walked three of the next five batters before he was replaced by Joey Cantillo, who threw a couple of wild pitches into the dirt against the next two Yankees batters, allowing Aaron Judge and Stanton to score for a 3-0 New York lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, owners of 27 World Series titles, are chasing their first appearance in a World Series since they beat Philadelphia for the crown in 2009.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians are seeking their first World Series appearance since 2016 and their first title since 1948. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany secured a place in the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over old rivals the Netherlands on Monday, while France won in Belgium and Italy continued their recent revival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jamie Leweling of Stuttgart scored on his debut to give Germany victory over the Netherlands in Munich and guarantee them one of the top two spots in Group 3 of League A.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the eighth meeting of the teams in the last six years but, for the Dutch, there was nothing familiar about Leweling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23-year-old was an addition to the Germany squad for this month's games following an injury to Jamal Musiala.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was then called off the bench to start the game after an injury to club teammate Deniz Undav in the warm-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leweling found the net after just two minutes only for that effort to be ruled out for an offside in the build-up, but he then blasted in the winner on 64 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Jamie had an outstanding debut – it's not often the Allianz Arena gives you a reception like that – he did well," said captain Joshua Kimmich.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany have 10 points from four games and will definitely take part in the quarter-finals next March.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Netherlands, who were without the suspended Virgil van Dijk, are level on five points with Hungary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hungarians won 2-0 on Monday away in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai, of Liverpool, opening the scoring late in the first half and adding a penalty after the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy remain top of Group A2 after easing to a 4-1 win at home to Israel in Udine. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Los Angeles pitcher Jack Flaherty dominated over seven scoreless innings and the Dodgers shut out the New York Mets 9-0 on Sunday in game one of Major League Baseball's National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mookie Betts delivered a three-run double. Max Muncy drove in two runs and Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani singled in a run and electrified the Dodger Stadium crowd with a hit that threatened to clear the outfield wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it was more stellar pitching, backed by lockdown defense and a disciplined performance at the plate that propelled the Dodgers to victory in game one of the best-of-seven series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pitchers have now tied the major league post-season record of 33 consecutive scoreless innings, set by the Baltimore Orioles over the first four games of the 1996 World Series against the Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Each and every one of the pitchers has been doing their job exceptionally well and it's really setting the tone for the offensive part of the game to be able to feel comfortable and score runs," Ohtani said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers will try to double their series lead when they host game two on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will advance to the World Series to face either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians, who are set to clash in the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It started with Flaherty, who retired the first nine batters he faced, giving up two hits and two walks with six strikeouts before departing with the Dodgers up 6-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile Mets starting pitcher Kodai Senga lasted just four outs, his inability to throw strikes proving costly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After retiring Ohtani to start the bottom of the first, Senga walked three straight batters to load the bases then gave up a single to Muncy that scored two runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He walked Gavin Lux to open the second. Lux advanced to second on a sacrifice fly and scored when Ohtani cracked a sharp single to right field, spelling the end of Senga's day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He just didn't have it together," Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, serenaded with chants of "MVP" whenever he was at the plate, scored on a bloop single to left field by Freddy Freeman and it was 6-0 Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty got through the fifth without giving up a run with help from the Dodgers defense. Mets designated hitter Jesse Winker led off the inning with a single.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jose Iglesias followed with a single and when Winker hesitated trying for third he was caught for the first out of another scoreless inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts boosted the score in the bottom of the eighth, belting a bases-loaded double to left field that scored all three runners and made it 9-0 – the most lopsided shutout win in Dodgers playoff history. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya obliterated the women's world record by almost two minutes on Sunday as she won the Chicago Marathon in 2 hours, 9 minutes and 56 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 30-year-old Chepngetich, who became the first three-time women's winner of the Chicago race, broke the previous world record of 2hours, 11minutes 53 seconds set by Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa last year in Berlin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I feel so great, I'm proud of myself. This is my dream that has come true," said Chepngetich, the 2019 world marathon champion. "I've fought a lot, thinking about the world record and I have fulfilled it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the absence of Olympic champion Sifan Hassan, the 2023 Chicago winner, Chepngetich set a blazing early pace and reached the halfway point in 1:04:16, the fifth-quickest time in history for a half marathon by a woman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The weather was perfect and I was well prepared. The world record was in my mind," said Chepngetich, runner-up to Hassan 12 months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At one point, Chepngetich was on track to shave more than three minutes off the world record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She slowed slightly in the closing kilometres but still had plenty in the tank and beat her own personal best by four-plus minutes, which she had clocked when winning the race two years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ethiopia's Sutume Kebede came second on Sunday, while Chepngetich's Kenyan compatriot, Irine Cheptai, finished third. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Caleb Williams threw four touchdown passes – two each to receiver Keenan Allen and tight end Cole Kmet – and the Chicago Bears held a tea party celebration in the end zone in a 35-16 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Along with the rookie quarterback's big day, Kmet chipped in by handling emergency long-snapping duties as the Bears won their third straight game for the first time in nearly four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allen led a tea party celebration after his 9-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter and his second score gave Chicago a 28-10 early in the fourth. D'Andre Swift added a 1-yard plunge for the Bears.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Jaguars started fast but Gabe Davis dropped a pass in the end zone – after he was whistled for a false start – and Jacksonville settled for a field goal on its opening drive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Davis later caught two second-half touchdown passes from Trevor Lawrence – the second made the score 35-16.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kmet broke two tackles on a 31-yard touchdown reception to give Chicago a 7-3 lead in the second quarter when the Bears mixed in no-huddle to spark their offense. He then snapped for the extra point because long snapper Scott Daly left the game earlier with a knee injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams found Kmet in the end zone with 13 seconds left in the half to complete an 85-yard drive than included the rookie quarterback scrambling for 23 yards on one play and 19 on another.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams, the No. 1 pick in this year's NFL draft, finished 23 of 29 for 226 yards with the four TD passes and one interception. He picked up 56 yards on four carries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jags coach Doug Pederson, who got a vote of confidence from ownership on Saturday, told the NFL Network at halftime while trailing 14-3 that his team had “self-inflicted wounds.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jags tight end Evan Engram, in his first action since Week 1, fumbled after a reception on Jacksonville’s first drive of the third quarter. The Bears turned that into points when Allen scored his first touchdown with the team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawrence completed 23 of 35 passes for 234 yards, two touchdown passes and one interception. Engram had 10 catches for 102 yards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is Chicago's first three-game winning streak since late in the 2020 season. (AP)

    Sabalenka outlasts Zheng to win third Wuhan Open title

  <img alt="Sabalenka reacts after winnning a point against China’s Zheng Qinwen. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774370_1_20241014080943.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aryna Sabalenka became the first player to win the Wuhan Open three times by defeating local hero Zheng Qinwen 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the final on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top seed, who also triumphed at the event in 2018 and 2019, kept her undefeated record in Wuhan intact, improving to a perfect 17-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka was put to the test by a gritty Zheng in a rematch of the 2024 Australian Open final before she captured an Open era record fifth title on Chinese soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two Grand Slam titles and a WTA 1000 success in Cincinnati under her belt already in 2024, Sabalenka picked up her fourth trophy of the season from seven finals reached.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old strengthened her chances of ending the year as the world number one ahead of Iga Swiatek, a battle likely to come down to the wire at the WTA Finals in Riyadh next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's a really tight ranking right now. Really nice to see," said Sabalenka, who trails Swiatek in the world rankings by less than 100 points. "We'll see after the finals if I was good enough this season to become world number one."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zheng had never taken a set off of Sabalenka in any of their previous three meetings, which have all come on the Grand Slam stage and in the past 13 months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Sunday's final was a different story, with Zheng, the reigning Olympic gold medallist, competing in front of her home fans in the city where she grew up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka broke for a 4-2 advantage on a Zheng double-fault in front of a capacity crowd of 13,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Belarusian wrapped up the 38-minute opening set with her second ace of the match, dropping just five points on serve along the way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   22-year-old Zheng, meanwhile, can still take positives from her week in Wuhan, where she is the first Chinese finalist in tournament history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has made a crucial jump in the Race to the WTA Finals, from number nine to number seven, increasing her chances of becoming the first Chinese player to qualify for the season-ending championships since Li Na in 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That could come down to the WTA 500 tournament in Ningbo next week but Zheng said she has not decided yet whether she'll play after being troubled by a fever over the past two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm feeling a little bit weak in my health. I will need to be really cautious," Zheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Competing in Ningbo is important, but my health is also important," she added. "I need to find the balance between the two." (AFP)

  <img alt='In a nod to Roger Federer, who was watching from the stands, Jannik Sinner joked: "There are legends everywhere, I just try to keep up a little bit." Photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774331_1_20241013193439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner defeated 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 on Sunday to win the Shanghai Masters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner took a crucial break in the fourth game of the second set to defeat the Serb in 1hr 37min and deny him a 100th career singles title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was just too good today, too strong, too fast," said Djokovic after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner saluted his opponent as a "legend" who kept playing "incredible tennis... year after year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a nod to former Djokovic rival Roger Federer, who was watching from the stands, the 23-year-old joked: "There are legends everywhere, I just try to keep up a little bit."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Facing off before an impassioned crowd, neither player blinked in the first set, unable to break the other's serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the tiebreak Sinner quickly took control, breaking Djokovic's serve on the first point and going 5-1 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Serb steadied himself but then netted a volley to bring up set point at 6-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner failed to convert initially but didn't miss the second time behind serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The next key moment came in the fourth game of the second set, when Sinner was up 40-15 on Djokovic's serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Djokovic saved one break point with a fiery ace, but couldn't stop a superb forehand down the line from Sinner that saw him pull ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All that remained was for the Italian to hold his nerve, hitting an ace to finish the match and claim the title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner's triumph caps off a formidable year, in which he has won two Grand Slams and retained the top spot in the rankings since June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it is also a year that has seen him embroiled in controversy after he twice tested positive for a banned steroid in March.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted Sinner's explanation that the drug entered his system unintentionally when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But last month the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said it would appeal the decision to clear him of wrongdoing and was seeking a ban of up to two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That news came as Sinner was contesting the China Open, where he lost in the final to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, who was also watching from the stands on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He admitted coming into the Shanghai tournament that he was "not in a situation where I feel comfortable in it." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Yin Ruoning said she had "goosebumps" after six birdies on the back nine in a spectacular final round of 64 on Sunday gave her a six-stroke victory at the Buick LPGA Shanghai, her first tour win at home in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 22-year-old Shanghai native and former world number one finished on 25-under par, roared all the way by her hometown crowd, having begun the day one stroke behind Japan's Mao Saigo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saigo's one-under 71 left her sharing second place on 19-under with Kim Sei-young of South Korea, who carded a four-under 68.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's amazing to be able to win at home," said Chinese number one Yin following a victory romp over the closing nine holes that thrilled her legion of fans in her home city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The crowd is amazing, people shouting my name and rooting for me," added Yin, who said she was looking to see her mother but couldn't manage it among the large galleries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This tournament really, really means a lot to me and I'm just so happy I'm able to win," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At just 22, Yin now has four LPGA wins including one major – last year's Women's PGA Championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked what comes next, she said: "We'll see."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let me finish today and just have fun with my mom, and we'll think about it later."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim, another former number one, had led for the first two rounds after a dazzling 62 on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fourth was Yealimi Noh of the United States, whose final-round 67 left her seven strokes adrift of Yin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My best finish of the year, so it's been really nice," said Noh, describing it as a "solid week".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just hit it really well which was really surprising and I was grateful... because I had some back problems coming into the week," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number four Yin immediately wiped out Saigo's lead at the start of the round, carding a birdie on the first.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She edged in front with another on the fifth before her back-nine birdie barrage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai sensation was met with a champagne shower and a roar from the packed crowds around the 18th as a final birdie sealed the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It gives me goosebumps when I think about it right now," Yin told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I mean, all the fans, the energy, it's just phenomenal." (AFP)

    Chris Froome and Sarah Lee among HK Cyclothon riders

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome and Hong Kong's two-time Olympic medallist Sarah Lee were among those who took part in this year's Hong Kong Cyclothon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 50-kilometre race kicked off in Tsim Sha Tsui at around 5.15am on Sunday, and the route includes Tsing Ma Bridge, Ting Kau Bridge and Stonecutters Bridge, as well as several tunnels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Froome said he very much enjoyed his first Cyclothon, as the ride in Hong Kong is very different from racing in Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Seeing Hong Kong by bike through all the main roads, it's just such a pleasure. I think these are roads that cyclists would never normally get the chance to enjoy," the British rider said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So to be able to really take in the city, take in the surroundings, yeah, just such an amazing experience."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee, for her part, said while it's her third time taking part in the Cyclothon, this is the first time where she wasn't going for speed and has more time to enjoy the experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the most beautiful part of the route is the Stonecutters Bridge. Usually you look at the bridge from the pier, you already find it beautiful -- but when you actually ride a bike on the bridge it's a different feeling," she told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In terms of difficulty, it's really the general situation in Hong Kong, you have to make sharp U-turns in many places [along the route]. If there are earlier traffic signs about them, it'd be better."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers said a record 6,000 people joined this year's Cyclothon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As part of the event, the Tourism Board also hosted a sports carnival at the West Kowloon Cultural District, with local food stalls, yoga sessions and freestyle cycling performances all part of the programme.

    Ronaldo powers Portugal; Spain break Denmark's heart

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cristiano Ronaldo scored as Portugal beat Poland 3-1 for their third straight Nations League win on Saturday, while European champions Spain put an end to Denmark's perfect start in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bernardo Silva volleyed Portugal ahead in the 26th minute in Warsaw as Bruno Fernandes cleverly nodded a cross from Ruben Neves back towards the Manchester City midfielder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ronaldo then found himself in the right place at the right time to turn in the rebound for Portugal's second after Rafael Leao's shot came back off the post following a brilliant surging run by the AC Milan winger.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old Ronaldo has now struck in all three games of this Nations League campaign for Portugal, taking his record men's international goals tally to 133.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Piotr Zielinski cut the deficit for Poland but Jan Bednarek's own goal sealed victory for Portugal, the lone remaining team in League A with a 100 percent record, and they could secure a place in the quarter-finals next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We worked very hard the last few days, preparing various solutions for this game, and we were able to show it on the pitch. I am really satisfied because we controlled this game," said Portugal coach Roberto Martinez. "We played great as a team."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Portugal have a maximum nine points in Group A1, three ahead of Croatia who beat Scotland 2-1 to condemn their opponents to a third successive defeat in the section.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ryan Christie's first half-goal gave Scotland a shock lead in Zagreb, but Igor Matanovic equalised before the interval and Andrej Kramaric bagged the winner midway through the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Che Adams thought he had salvaged a stoppage-time equaliser but VAR disallowed his effort for offside, with Scotland winless in nine competitive outings -- the longest run in their history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain needed a 79th-minute effort from Martin Zubimendi to shrug off Denmark 1-0 in Murcia as captain Alvaro Morata showed off the European Championship trophy to fans before kick-off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hosts were without Rodri and Dani Carvajal, both sidelined by long-term injuries, with first-choice goalkeeper Unai Simon still recovering from wrist surgery. Nico Williams, Dani Olmo and Robin Le Normand had also been ruled out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Luis de la Fuente's team grabbed the only goal when Zubimendi's low drive from just outside the area squirmed past Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who had earlier denied Lamine Yamal and Alvaro Morata.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm very happy with the goal, but above all in such a close game in which we had to open the scoring," said Real Sociedad midfielder Zubimendi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He doesn't score many but he's starting to so I hope he continues like this," said De la Fuente. "He's one of the best players in the world in his position."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain moved up to seven points, one above Denmark, with Serbia picking up their first win after beating Switzerland 2-0 in Leskovac.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Serbia led through Nico Elvedi's own goal in first-half stoppage time and Aleksandar Mitrovic doubled the advantage before Predrag Rajkovic saved a penalty from Swiss striker Breel Embolo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both games in Group C3 finished goalless as Bulgaria were held at home by Luxembourg and Northern Ireland drew against Belarus on neutral ground in Hungary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Romania eased to a 3-0 win away to Cyprus in Group C2, while Kosovo beat Lithuania 2-1. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the Wuhan Open final for the third time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A champion in Wuhan in 2018 and 2019, Sabalenka improved her perfect record in the tournament to 16-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff, who was on a nine-match winning streak on the back of her title run in Beijing last week, played a perfect first set but committed a whopping 21 double-faults during a semi-final lasting two hours, 26 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has now won 19 of her last 20 matches, a stretch that includes titles in Cincinnati and at the US Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The atmosphere was incredible," said Sabalenka, who was 2-4 down in the second set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It definitely felt like one of the biggest matches of my career because the crowd made it feel like it was a Grand Slam final."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka struggled on serve early on and couldn't control her forehand as a clinical Gauff leapt to a double-break 5-0 lead inside 19 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The American dropped a mere two points behind her first serve and limited the Belarusian to just two winners throughout that opening frame.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the first set was a rout, the second was a dogfight with six of the first eight games going against serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After 78 minutes of play, Sabalenka found herself in the lead for the first time in the match, inching ahead 5-4 to up the pressure on Gauff, whose serve abandoned her when she needed it most.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Gauff's double-fault count rising, Sabalenka took full advantage and broke serve to level the contest and force a decider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A marathon third game that witnessed seven deuces and three break points saw Sabalenka win a seventh consecutive game and hold for a 3-0 lead in the final set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite Gauff's best retaliatory efforts to level for 4-4 Sabalenka held on to close out a gritty victory. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner reached the final of the Shanghai Masters after convincingly defeating the Czech Republic's Tomas Machac 6-4, 7-5 on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner will take on Novak Djokovic in the final, who fought through a knee problem to defeat Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) in an "incredible fight" on Saturday, setting up a blockbuster Shanghai Masters showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33rd-ranked Machac was looking to repeat his giant-slaying of Thursday, when he knocked out world number two Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The semi-final got off to an electric start when the Czech broke Sinner in the first game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the two-time Grand Slam champion kept his cool to break back in the fourth, then claimed the tenth game to clinch the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second set neither was able to break serve until the 12th game, when the Italian hit a winner to book his place in Sunday's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough... he is playing with so much confidence and he can hit a ball really hard, and is serving very well," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I tried to stay there mentally... I'm very happy about how I'm fighting at the moment." (AFP)

  <img alt="Serbia’s Novak Djokovic celebrates winning against Czech Republic’s Jakub Mensik during their match at the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774140_1_20241011213250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Novak Djokovic proved his staying power on Friday, beating an opponent 18 years his junior 6-7 (4/7), 6-1, 6-4 to claim the last spot in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37-year-old's victory over the Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik came a day after one of his greatest rivals and contemporaries, Rafael Nadal, announced he would retire in November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Serb, who is aiming for a 100th singles title in Shanghai, will next face world number seven Taylor Fritz after the American beat Belgium's David Goffin 6-3, 6-4 earlier on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall, big battle, it took the best out of me to win it," said Djokovic after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both Djokovic and 65th-ranked Mensik brought serious firepower to the court, their hard-hitting rallies driving the stadium wild with tension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first set was closely fought, with Djokovic's break in the ninth game matched immediately by Mensik in the next.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The veteran pulled ahead early in the tiebreak, but seemed to lose focus, allowing the 19-year-old to come from behind to win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 24-time Grand Slam champion dominated the second set though, breaking in the second and sixth game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mensik recovered to pile on the pressure again in the third, but Djokovic got a crucial break in the fifth game to be crowned winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Djokovic called his opponent "one of the best players we have on the tour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's only 19 and he's already playing at such a high level, managing situations of high pressure so well for someone who doesn't have much experience," he said. "I think the future is very bright for him." (AFP)

    Guardians down Tigers to stay alive in MLB playoffs

  <img alt="David Fry smashes a 97 mph fastball from Beau Brieske over the left center-field fence. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=5&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774068_1_20241011100522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   David Fry blasted the go-ahead two-run home run and the Cleveland Guardians held on for a 5-4 victory over Detroit on Thursday to force a decisive game five in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians levelled the best-of-five American League division series at two games apiece and will host the deciding game on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland, shut out by the upstart Tigers in games two and three, were down 3-2 when Fry was called in to pinch hit with one runner on and two out in the top of the seventh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He deposited a 97 mph fastball from Tigers reliever Beau Brieske over the left center-field fence to put the Guardians ahead for good.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was just trying to get a pitch to hit," Fry said. "I had some opportunities yesterday to drive some runners in and didn't get the job done. So I was looking to get it done for the boys and luckily it went out."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland added a run in the top of the ninth, Fry laying down a bunt that allowed Brayan Rocchio to score from third base. Rocchio had singled with one out in the inning and reached third on Steven Kwan's base hit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Luckily it worked," Fry said of the bunt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That insurance run proved necessary when the Tigers clawed one back in the bottom of the ninth. Justyn-Henry Malloy opened the inning off Cleveland closing pitcher Emmanuel Clase with a double to left field. He reached third on a ground out by Parker Meadows and scored on another ground ball by Jace Jung before Clase recorded the final out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland ended a streak of 11 defeats in playoff elimination games, a skid dating back to game six of the 1997 World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jose Ramirez also homered for the Guardians and Zach McKinstry homered for Detroit in a tense battle that twice saw the Tigers rally to tie it before they took a 3-2 on Wenceel Perez's run-scoring single in the sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will face either the New York Yankees or Kansas City Royals for a place in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees took a 2-1 series lead into game four in Kansas City on Thursday, hoping pitching ace Gerrit Cole can recover from a lacklustre performance in a game one loss and still waiting for slugger Aaron Judge to come alive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge, who led the major leagues with 58 home runs in the regular season, is 1-for-11 at the plate in the first three games of the series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton was the hero of the 3-2 game-three win that put the Yankees on the cusp of advancing, belting a go-ahead solo homer in the eighth inning as part of a three-hit night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stanton was confident that Judge would break out of the doldrums.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's definitely going to do damage," Stanton said. "It's only a matter of time. He's had good at-bats, so, yeah, it'll come when we need him most." (AFP)

  <img alt="Vangelis Pavlidis drills home Greece's late winner. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774051_1_20241011081430.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 94th-minute winner by Vangelis Pavlidis gave Greece a 2-1 victory on Thursday against England in a Nations League clash overshadowed by the death of Greek player George Baldock on the eve of the game, while Italy were held to a draw by Belgium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greek striker Pavlidis netted a brace, either side of a late Jude Bellingham goal, to send Greece top of Group B2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greece's first-ever victory against England came in an emotionally-charged evening at Wembley, which started with a minute's silence prior to kick-off for Baldock, an English-born Greece international who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a really special day for us because of George. We are people and it's a special night because of him," Pavlidis told ITV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A difficult moment for us because George was part of the team. Special guy. We have to play for him and it doesn't matter the score today. We gave everything for him."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Greeks took a deserved lead in the 49th minute when Pavlidis danced through flimsy defending in the England box, before driving the ball past Jordan Pickford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visitors had three disallowed goals in the match – the last of which came just minutes before Real Madrid's Bellingham hammered in an 87th-minute equaliser for England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Greece were not to be denied a third win in three Nations League matches as England failed to clear the danger in their area and Pavlidis took full advantage and drilled home a late winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Group A2, Italy and Belgium played out an eventful 2-2 draw in Rome.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Italians raced into the lead inside 60 seconds when Andrea Cambiaso got his first international goal by bundling home from close range.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mateo Retegui doubled the hosts' lead on 24 minutes, sweeping home with his left foot after a spilled save.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy looked comfortable and were dominating the encounter until they suffered a double blow inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lorenzo Pellegrini initially picked up a yellow card for his late lunge on Arthur Theate in the 38th minute but, after a VAR review, the Italy playmaker was instead shown a straight red.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Belgium then duly halved the deficit from the resulting free-kick, with Maxim De Cuyper finishing emphatically from 25 yards following a clever set-piece move.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard completed the Belgian comeback on 61 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A deep corner was nodded back across goal and Trossard ghosted past the static defence to prod the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are episodes that can change a game, like their goal immediately after we went down to ten men," said Italy coach Luciano Spalletti.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A result doesn't always depend on the football you play and your tactics. Certainly, we could have played better in the second half after a very good first half."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy remain top of their group with France sitting second after they beat Israel 4-1 in Budapest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eduardo Camavinga gave France a seventh-minute lead when the goalkeeper fumbled his tame effort, allowing the ball to bounce over the line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Omri Gandelman levelled on 24 minutes, before Christopher Nkunku restored France's advantage four minutes later with a sharp finish.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the clock wound down, the visitors added two more goals to their tally via Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erling Haaland scored a brace as Norway eased past Slovenia 3-0 in Oslo to sit top of Group B3, three points ahead of Austria who beat Kazakhstan 4-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Republic of Ireland came from behind in Helsinki to beat Finland 2-1, they sit third in Group B2 behind England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, Germany visit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary host the Netherlands in Group A3, while Iceland take on Wales in Group B4. (AFP)

    Rafael Nadal to retire from tennis

  <img alt="Nadal has won more French Open singles titles than any other tennis player in history. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773995_1_20241010185127.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal announced on Thursday he would retire from tennis at age 38 following next month's Davis Cup finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal won 22 Grand Slam singles titles during an unprecedented era in the 2000s and 2010s that he shared with his rivals in the so-called Big Three, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Really, everything I have experienced has been a dream come true," Nadal said in an announcement on social media. "I leave with the absolute peace of mind of having given my best, of having made an effort in every way.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spaniard indicated his decision was related to persistent injury problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially. I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations. It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life, everything has a beginning and an end,” Nadal said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal’s unrelenting, physical style of play — every point pursued as though it were his last, sprinting and sliding into place for that high-bouncing bullwhip of a lefty forehand — made him one of the greats of the game and the unquestioned King of Clay, the slow, red surface on which he claimed his record 14 French Open championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That’s more than anyone, man or woman, won at any one of the sport’s four major tournaments, a dominance celebrated by a statue of Nadal that stands near the main entrance to the grounds of Roland Garros and in the shadow of its main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal added he was excited to finish his career at the Davis Cup, which will be played in Malaga, Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am very excited that my last tournament will be the final of the Davis Cup and representing my country," he said. "I think I’ve come full circle since one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Seville in 2004.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal has not played since the Paris Olympics, where he lost to old rival Djokovic in the second round of the singles tournament and reached the quarterfinals of the men’s doubles with Carlos Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think it is the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined," he said. (AP)

   The 25-year-old clubbed a four off spinner Saim Ayub to become the sixth Englishman to score 300 or more in Test cricket, achieving the feat off 310 balls, with 28 fours and three sixes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England declared their first innings at a mammoth 823-7 before tea for a lead of 267 runs.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Francisco Lindor hit the go-ahead grand slam in the sixth inning Wednesday for the Mets, who beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 to win their National League Division Series three games to one.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lindor's homer was just the latest dramatic moment for the surging Mets, who will face either the Los Angeles Dodgers or San Diego Padres in the NL Championship Series beginning Sunday on the road in a best-of-seven series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Díaz struck out Kyle Schwarber with two runners aboard to end it as New York finished off the rival Phillies in Game 4 of their best-of-five Division Series, winning 3-1 to wrap up a postseason series at home for the first time in 24 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I want to win it all – and ours will be a team that will forever be remembered,” Lindor said, speaking in the interview room with one of his young daughters on his lap drinking from a Gatorade bottle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This will be a team that comes every 10 years and eats for free everywhere they go – and I want to do that. But the job is not done."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets opened the season 0-5, were 11 games under .500 in early June and didn't clinch the NL's sixth seed until September 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The season-ending loss represents the latest October disappointment for the NL East-winning Phillies, who reached the World Series as the No. 6 seed in 2022 but lost in the NLCS last year before being eliminated in their first playoff series this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Mookie Betts homered for the second straight night, Shohei Ohtani hit an RBI single and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 8-0 Wednesday night to force a deciding Game 5 in their tense NL Division Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Will Smith and Gavin Lux each hit a two-run homer for the Dodgers, who snapped a two-game losing streak and now return home for the next matchup between the NL West rivals on Friday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Padres won 10-2 at Dodger Stadium in Game 2 on Sunday night, when tempers flared on the field and in the stands .

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City made a spectacular return to the Uefa Women's Champions League on Wednesday, defeating holders Barcelona 2-0 in the opening round of group stage matches as Bayern Munich downed Arsenal 5-2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both teams hit the woodwork in a lively start to the Group D clash at a sold-out Joie Stadium in Manchester, with City grabbing the lead when defender Naomi Layzell bravely scrambled home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vivianne Miedema headed smartly back across goal from a corner and a lunging Layzell reacted quickest to prod the ball past a crowd of Barcelona players.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year's Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati went close to an equaliser with a deflected effort, but Khadija Shaw grabbed a second for City to condemn Barcelona to a rare defeat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's fantastic from Naomi and Shaw finishes it off. It gave the players a real lift and we have to remember who we're playing against. It's a step for us," City manager Gareth Taylor said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are making their first group stage appearance, having last played in the Champions League proper in 2021 when Barcelona knocked them out in the quarter-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The defeat is only Barcelona's second in 19 games in the group stage since its introduction for the 2021-22 season. It is also the first time they have failed to score a goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Pernille Harder scored a second-half hat-trick as Bayern kicked off their Group C campaign with a convincing victory over Arsenal in Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal led through Mariona Caldentey's strike in Germany, but Bayern captain Glodis Viggosdottir brought the home side level before Sydney Lohmann put them ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Laia Codina equalised for Arsenal midway through the second half only for Harder to find the net three times in the final 20 minutes to secure an impressive win for German champions Bayern.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The last few years have been tough with injuries, so now I'm just happy to be back playing in the Champions League. I was happy with the goals and the win," said Harder, who ended a two-year goal drought in the competition. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Joe Root went past Alastair Cook as England's highest Test run scorer with an unconquered hundred against Pakistan, anchoring his team to 492-3 in the first Test in Multan on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33-year-old overhauled Cook's aggregate of 12,472 runs and became the fifth-highest scorer of all time after he drove seamer Aamer Jamal for a straight boundary to reach 71 just before lunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root was still batting on 176 at the close on day three with his partner Harry Brook on 141 not out, taking England within 64 runs of Pakistan's first innings total of 556.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pair added 243 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket, rebuffing Pakistan's bowling attack on a lifeless pitch that had punished England's bowlers on the first two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm obviously proud but I still feel there's plenty more left to do and many more runs to get," said Root.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I always think your best hundred is your next one," he said. "You've got to keep staying hungry and willing to find ways of contributing, ways of getting better."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm sure I'll be looking back on it at some point when I'm finished and be very proud of it," Root added. "But we've still got an opportunity to go and win this game which is exciting."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's head coach Jason Gillespie said his team needed early wickets on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We suspected the way England will look to get a lead and have a crack at us," he told reporters. "We have to come out in the morning and hit the ground running."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root's memorable 481-minute knock included 12 boundaries. Brook amassed the same number and added a six despite suffering cramps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook reached his sixth hundred with a single off part-timer Saud Shakeel from 118 balls, adding to his previous three in England's 3-0 series rout of Pakistan two years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root added 136 for the third wicket with Ben Duckett, who made a robust 84 and showed no effect from a thumb dislocation on Tuesday that forced him to bat at number four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duckett was the only man dismissed in the second session, trapped leg-before by Jamal after hitting 11 boundaries. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has a new role as head of football operations at Red Bull, which owns the Leipzig, Salzburg and New York clubs, the company said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After nearly 25 years on the sidelines, I couldn't be more excited to be involved in a project like this," said Klopp, who left Liverpool at the end of last season after nine years in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 57-year-old will start his tenure on January 1, 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I still love football and I still love working and Red Bull gives me the perfect platform for that," Klopp said in a video on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to share my experience," he added. "I want to learn again, because when you are in the job and play every three days you barely have time for that – and now I have time. I want to see, feel, figure out what is useful for football."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to a statement released by the Austrian energy drinks brand on Wednesday, "Klopp will not interfere in the day-to-day business of the clubs, but rather take on a higher-level strategic position."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I couldn't be more excited," Klopp said, adding "I see my role primarily as a mentor for the coaches and management of the Red Bull clubs."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Germany reports Klopp's contract includes an exit clause which allows him to take over as manager of the German national side should be approached.

  <img alt="Italy's Jannik Sinner reacts after a point against Ben Shelton of the US during their match at the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773837_1_20241009172629.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner will face Daniil Medvedev in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals after both had straight-set victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner put some old demons to rest in overcoming American Ben Shelton 6-4, 7-6 (7/1), while Medvedev took out Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shelton, ranked 16, knocked Sinner out at the same stage last year, but on Wednesday the Italian looked confident from the start as he won in 88 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Open champion pulled ahead in the ninth game of the first set, breaking when Shelton hit long, then dominated the second set tiebreak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough, you don't have so much control when you play against him... I just tried to stay strong mentally," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number five Medvedev and Tsitsipas were meeting for the 14th time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Greek started the second set strongly, breaking in the first game, but Medvedev broke in the fourth and eighth to progress.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev and Sinner have met four times this year already in the final stages of tournaments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner beat Medvedev in the semi-finals at Miami, the quarter-finals at the US Open and in the Australian Open final, but the Russian ended the Italian's hopes in the last eight at Wimbledon in an epic five-set battle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm gonna bring the fight," said Medvedev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I could have done much better in the US Open... I didn't explore enough my potential during this match. So I'm going to try to explore this potential tomorrow," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also through to the quarterfinals is world number two Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in the China Open final a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old was facing off against veteran Gael Monfils, winning 6-4, 7-5 for a 12th straight victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Frenchman had upset Alcaraz at their last meeting in August at Cincinnati, and the Spaniard admitted that "was on his mind" during the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really, really happy I won the match, and that I stayed calm through the whole match," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Playing against Gael is never easy... You need to be focused on every ball," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in action on Wednesday are four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic and world number three Alexander Zverev. (AFP)
