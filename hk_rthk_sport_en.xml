<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer will likely not play again in 2024, coach Vincent Kompany said ahead of Tuesday's clash with Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He's got a broken rib, which means he probably won't play again this year," Kompany said. "What's important is that it heals now – hopefully from the start of January we'll have him back, but for now it's too early."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kompany confirmed Neuer broke his rib in a collision with Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong on Tuesday, for which the goalie also picked up the first red card of his 866-game career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are missing several first-team players as an injury crisis sweeps through the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman, Alphonso Davies, Joao Palhinha, Serge Gnabry, Josip Stanisic, Hiroki Ito and Mathys Tel are all on the injured list, while back-up 'keeper Sven Ulreich is out for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing a lot of players, but I think we've come through well so far," Kompany said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's absence means Bayern's third-choice goalie, Daniel Peretz, will start between the sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israel goalkeeper will play his third game for Bayern having made his club debut off the bench after Neuer's sending off in the 1-0 German Cup last 16 loss to Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-time Champions League winners sit in 13th spot on the Champions League table after five matches, after three home wins and away losses to Barcelona and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Shakhtar would help Bayern's bid to finish in the top eight and avoid an additional playoff round. (AFP)

    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782725_1_20241209170136.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China on Sunday defeated Romania 8-2 to take bronze at the International Table Tennis Federation Mixed Team World Cup in Chengdu, as Team China successfully defended their title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng Wing-lam and Yiu Kwan-to handed the SAR the perfect start, after claiming all three games in their mixed doubles showdown over Elizabeta Samara and Ovidiu Ionescu by a final scoreline of 11-3, 11-6, 11-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting, who were paired during the Paris Olympics in July, defeated Bernadette Szocs and Eduard Ionescu in back-to-back showings to put the SAR within one game of claiming the bronze medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong and Yiu rounded out the evening with an 11-4 win against Darius Movileanu and Ionescu to secure the prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Team China, successfully retained their title after recording an 8-1 win over South Korea in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result gave the national team a clean sweep of the tournament, having won all 10 matches leading up to the final.

    Soto to sign with New York Mets on record 15-year deal

<img alt="Soto during match against the New York Mets at Citi Field. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782686_1_20241209121559.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican baseball superstar Juan Soto has agreed to join the New York Mets on a record-breaking 15-year, US$765 million deal, multiple US media reports said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and Major League Baseball's official website both reported Soto's blockbuster move, which if confirmed would be the richest contract in the history of North American professional sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soto had entered free agency after playing last season for the New York Yankees, who had hoped to re-sign the gifted 26-year-old outfielder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal reported on Sunday eclipses the US$700 million, 10-year contract the Los Angeles Dodgers signed with Japanese star Shohei Ohtani last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that Soto's Mets contract could eventually be worth more than US$800 million if certain benchmarks were met.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guessing game over Soto's likely next destination had dominated baseball's rumor mill since the Yankees were beaten 4-1 by the Dodgers in the World Series in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees had mounted a concerted effort to re-sign Soto, who blasted 41 home runs and amassed 166 hits for the Bronx Bombers last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Yankees were just one of several teams actively pursuing the explosive slugger, with the Mets and the Boston Red Sox amongst the teams who met with Soto's representatives to discuss a possible deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets, however, won the race for Soto after a season in which they made a giant-killing playoff run to the National League Championship Series, where they eventually lost to the Dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets will be the fourth team of Soto's relatively short career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He exploded onto the Major League Baseball scene during his first full season in 2019, helping the Washington Nationals score an upset World Series victory over the Houston Astros.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejected a 15-year, US$440 million offer to stay with the Nationals in 2022, and was eventually traded to the San Diego Padres in August of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Soto failed to settle in San Diego and headed back to the east coast in December 2023 in a trade that took him to the Yankees. (AFP)

    Jokić erupts as Denver rout Hawks, Heat stun Cavs

<img alt="Jokić shoots over Atlanta Hawks' centre Clint Capela. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782681_1_20241209113327.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nikola Jokić produced another dazzling high-scoring performance with a 48-point masterpice as the Denver Nuggets crushed the Atlanta Hawks 141-111 on the road on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokić – who scored a career-high 56 points in vain during a defeat to Washington on Saturday – was nearly unplayable in a dominant display that included 14 rebounds, eight assists and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Porter Jr. added 26 points for Denver while Christian Braun finished with 17 and Julian Strawther 13 in a wire-to-wire blowout against an Atlanta outfit who had gone into the contest on a six-game winning streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver coach Michael Malone was left purring with pleasure at Jokić's performance, describing the opportunity to coach the Serbian superstar as a privilege.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say I'm surprised because I've been spoiled by having the best seat in the house to watch this guy for 10 years, to watch him do it night-in, night-out," Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As much as we put on his shoulders, he never runs from it, never complains," he added. "I love his mental toughness and physical toughness. I feel privileged to have the chance to coach him – I never take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malone meanwhile was satisfied with a victory that lifts Denver to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a response that was needed," Malone said. "There's some stuff we can clean up, but we needed a win and we got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Sunday, Tyler Herro scored 34 points as the Miami Heat sent the Cleveland Cavaliers crashing to only their fourth defeat of the season with a 122-113 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro drained five three-pointers and was a perfect nine-from-nine from the free throw line to spearhead a third straight victory for in-form Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro was backed with 23 points from Duncan Robinson while Jimmy Butler added 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo also played a huge part in the victory with 16 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as Miami improved to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland meanwhile saw seven players finish in double figures, with Darius Garland leading the scoring with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disappointing loss for Cleveland was exacerbated by an injury to Evan Mobley who suffered a right ankle sprain that left him able to play only for 11min 46sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a bad one," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said of Mobley's injury, revealing the forward had initially sought to play through the knock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's a tough kid," Atkinson said. "It's unfortunate for us." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Griezmann struck a 94th-minute winner to snatch Atlético Madrid a thrilling 4-3 victory over Sevilla on Sunday in La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side, third, have won nine matches straight across all competitions and the win pulled them a point behind second-placed title holders Real Madrid and three behind leaders Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético showed character and quality as they fought back from two goals down in the second half to triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul powered Atlético ahead but Dodi Lukebakio equalised for 13th-placed Sevilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero sent the visitors ahead after half-an-hour and Juanlu Sánchez gave them a 3-1 lead before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Griezmann pegged one back before substitute Samuel Lino scored a stunning effort from the edge of the box and the Frenchman then blasted home in stoppage time to continue Atlético's superb run of form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lukebakio gave the ball away for De Paul's opener as he tried to dribble out of a dangerous area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentine midfielder lashed the ball beyond the reach of Sevilla goalkeeper Álvaro Fernández from the edge of the box in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Andalusians were quickly on level terms, with Lukebakio making amends two minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian forward, on the left of Atlético's area, took one step to beat his marker and smashed home at the near post, catching out Jan Oblak with his powerful strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla played with huge intensity, pressing Atletico and throwing themselves into tackles, up for the fight at the Metropolitano stadium in front of over 60,000 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took the lead in the 32nd minute when Romero broke in behind to reach Kike Salas' pass to net his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker fired past Oblak, who got a hand to his effort but could not keep the ball out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts battled hard to find a way back in but Francisco Garcia Pimienta's Sevilla soaked up the pressure and netted their third early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  They put together an excellent team move, involving Lukebakio, Djibril Sow and Salas, the latter of whom crossed for Sánchez to slam home at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were unperturbed and swiftly pulled one back through Griezmann, after an excellent through-ball from Spanish midfielder Pablo Barrios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla goalkeeper Fernández made several good saves as the Rojiblancos pushed for an equaliser, denying substitute Alexander Sorloth twice, and the Norwegian striker narrowly missed a tempting cross with a diving header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético pulled level thanks to Lino's spectacular strike from distance, which was reward for their heavy pressure in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla were under the cosh in the final stages and eventually caved when Griezmann swivelled and smashed the winner past the helpless Fernández. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea roared back from two goals down to beat Tottenham 4-3 on Sunday, moving just four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after Arsenal were held by Fulham.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners and Chelsea both started the day seven points adrift of Arne Slot's side, whose game this weekend was postponed due to stormy weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were forced to settle for a 1-1 draw but Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, kicking off later Sunday, mounted a stunning comeback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski put Spurs two goals up inside 11 minutes but Jadon Sancho quickly pulled one back with a fine strike and the second half belonged to the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and Enzo Fernandez put Chelsea ahead 12 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's ice-cool "Panenka" spot-kick gave the visitors a two-goal cushion before Son Heung-min added a late third for Spurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Chelsea now have 31 points after 15 games, two points ahead of London rivals Arsenal. Liverpool, with a game in hand, are on 35 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plan or the idea is to not let the players slow down," Maresca told Sky Sports. "They cannot drop because they know another player is waiting to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Italian, in his first season at Stamford Bridge, played down his team's title chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool probably don't slide like what Cucurella did," he added. "To be serious, we are not ready – we are far from these teams, but we focus on day-by-day and trying to improve the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat is a disastrous result for under-pressure Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, whose side hammered champions Manchester City 4-0 just two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a sore one, a painful one," said the Australian, whose team are now 11th in the Premier League table after their seventh defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Bukayo Saka had a late winner ruled out for offside by a VAR review as the Gunners' four-match winning streak was halted in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raúl Jiménez fired Fulham into an early lead before William Saliba levelled after yet another Arsenal goal from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed not to win the game – overall we absolutely dominated the game from start to end," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did all the things that we wanted to do during the game and unfortunately we concede one goal in one shot. The way the team played, the way the team wanted to win, it was unbelievable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were still without influential defensive pair Gabriel Magalhães and Riccardo Calafiori through injury and Fulham exposed a makeshift left side of the Gunners' backline to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal underlined their threat from set-pieces when they scored twice from corners to beat Manchester United 2-0 in midweek. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers on Sunday began their quest to make the final of an East Asian tournament with a dominant 3-0 victory over Mongolia at the Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China were in control from start to finish of the opener of the qualifying round of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Championship – in what was their fourth consecutive victory under coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Star winger Everton Camargo and midfielder Wong Wai each scored a goal for the home side before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, winger Nicholas Benavides came out to score his first goal for the SAR in only his second game by heading home a cross from substitute Mahama Awal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper and captain Edmond Yapp earned his 100th cap for Hong Kong, China, the first player from the SAR to reach the century mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  The football association marked the occasion by presenting him with a commemorative kit, to the delight of more than 3,300 spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will play against Chinese Taipei on Saturday in another Group B match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam and Macau are the two remaining teams in Group A, after North Korea withdrew from the competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two teams topping their respective groups will play in the final on 17 December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

    Vissel Kobe win the J. League for domestic double

<img alt="Members of Vissel Kobe celebrate with the title cup following their victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782620_1_20241208191040.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Vissel Kobe won on the final day of the season on Sunday to seal their second straight J. League title and complete a domestic double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kobe, who lifted the Emperor's Cup two weeks ago, started the day one point ahead of nearest challengers Sanfrecce Hiroshima and sealed the deal with a dominant 3-0 win at home to Shonan Bellmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima crashed 3-1 to Gamba Osaka while third-placed Machida Zelvia, who went into the final day with a slim chance of winning the title in their first season in the top flight, lost 3-1 to Kashima Antlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe are also on course to qualify from the league stage of the Asian Champions League as they chase an unprecedented treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of games this season and that's thanks to everyone in the team," said coach Takayuki Yoshida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've won two titles and we're progressing well in the Asian Champions League. I appreciate the hard work of everyone in the team, all the players and staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe won the J. League for the first time last season, almost five months after Spanish legend Andres Iniesta left the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona star spent five years in Kobe and played alongside two other World Cup winners in Spain's David Villa and Germany's Lukas Podolski.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Kobe's high-profile overseas players have since departed and the club have found success through former Japan internationals such as Yoshinori Muto, once of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the players have given 100 percent in games and in training," said Muto, who scored 13 goals for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strong point of our team is that everyone is willing to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe lined up against lowly Shonan knowing that a win would guarantee them a second title, and Taisei Miyashiro put them in front in the 26th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto forced a save from Shonan goalkeeper Naoto Kamifukumoto with a powerful header and Miyashiro swept home the rebound from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto made it two just minutes before half time, finishing off a fast break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takahiro Ogihara put the icing on the cake with a stunning long-range effort in the 70th minute, his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima, led by German coach Michael Skibbe, started the day with a better goal difference than Kobe but they conceded early against Gamba and never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Machida had only a mathematical chance of winning the title just over a decade after being in non-league football. (AFP)

    HK Streetathon ends with some going the extra mile

<img alt="The Hong Kong Streetathon featured a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, a cross-harbour half marathon, and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782615_1_20241208180257.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 LA Galaxy beat New York Red Bulls 2-1 with goals from Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic to win a record-extending sixth MLS Cup and snap a 10-year championship drought on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The final looked like it would be one-sided when hosts and favourites Galaxy scored twice inside 13 minutes through Paintsil and Joveljic in front of a sun-soaked crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vaunted Red Bulls defence, who lost Andres Reyes just before the start of the game through illness, initially had no answer to Galaxy's aggressive offence despite playing without key injured midfielder Riqui Puig.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Bulls clawed one back in the 28th when the ball pinballed around in front of goal after a corner before finding Sean Nealis, who fired high past goalkeeper John McCarthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal immediately changed the tone of the contest as the home side began to play more tentatively and the Red Bulls began to go on the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides had chances in the second half and the Red Bulls battled to force extra time as the final whistle approached but Galaxy held firm as they sealed their first MLS Cup since 2014. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job," a disappointed Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said "I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fought incredible. We came back twice," said Guardiola. "We gave everything and we take a point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed City are eight points behind Liverpool and a fifth straight Premier League title is looking increasingly unlikely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final league derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park will be rescheduled after Storm Darragh battered western regions of England with high winds and heavy rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford enjoy the best home record in the division and made it seven wins from eight games at the Gtech Community Stadium with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo, who has been linked with a move to the Magpies, opened the scoring with a sensational individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle quickly levelled twice in the first half through Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes, either side of Yoane Wissa's second for Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calamitous defending cost Newcastle in the second period when Nathan Collins prodded home from goalkeeper Mark Flekken's long ball forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade then sealed the points for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are growing, a lot of the players here for a while have taken another step up," said Brentford boss Thomas Frank, whose team are seventh in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to carry on this home form but some wins on the road would be welcome too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 1-0 thanks to Jhon Duran's goal in his first Premier League start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's postponement means Arsenal and Chelsea have the chance the cut the gap at the top to four points later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners travel to Fulham while Chelsea are at Tottenham. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US national champion Amber Glenn stunned three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto to win women's gold ahead of five Japanese figure skaters at the ISU Grand Prix final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Glenn extended her lead from the short programme in the free skating final in south-eastern France, scoring a total of 212.07 points after two performances which both included her signature triple axel jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite six-skater competition included five Japanese skaters with Mone Chiba taking silver with 208.85 points and defending champion Sakamoto bronze with 201.13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sakamoto had not been beaten in a major competition since the 2022 Grand Prix final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Olympic bronze medallist paid for a fall on a triple toeloop which cost her points in the short programme.

  Glenn, 25, who won both her Grand Prix events in Angers, France and China this year, had not won an international event before this season and steps into the spotlight just over a year ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Ding Liren and his teenage challenger Gukesh Dommaraju of India remained even on Saturday with only four games to go in their World Chess Championship match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The score is deadlocked at five points each after 10 games in the 14-match series as both agreed to a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each player has won one game apiece, with Ding taking the opening match on November 25 and Guksesh coming back to defeat the champion in game three. The rest ended in draws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, 32, gained an early advantage on Saturday playing with the white pieces but the game soon fizzled to a draw as neither player made any inroads after 36 moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the tournament neared the homestretch, both players admitted that each move will be crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the cost of one game is higher than it was maybe ... a few games before," the 18-year-old Gukesh said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But my approach and my goal is still the same: to play good games in every single game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding said "there's not so much room to make mistakes" anymore and every loss "will result in a very bad situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  If both remain tied after 14 rounds, the match will move to a tie-breaker, which will be played on December 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding beat Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi last year to become the world champion in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his age, Gukesh is the youngest player in history to compete in the World Championship and he is looking to surpass Garry Kasparov as the youngest undisputed world chess champion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool's Merseyside derby trip to Everton on Saturday was postponed due to adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Darragh.
 <br>
  <br>
  High winds and heavy rain have battered western parts of the United Kingdom, causing widespread travel disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Everton said the fixture had been postponed on safety grounds following a meeting between both clubs, local police and Liverpool City Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst we appreciate this will be deeply disappointing for supporters, the safety of fans, staff and players is of paramount importance," Everton's statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fixture will be the final Merseyside derby in the league at Everton's Goodison Park, home to the club since 1892, before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead the Premier League by seven points after 14 games of the 38-match season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fixtures in England's second tier Championship in Plymouth and Cardiff were postponed on Friday due to a rare red weather warning issued by the MET office, the UK's national weather service, for south-west England and Wales. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

    Spurs rocked as Huijsen seals Bournemouth win

<img alt="Tottenham's Son Heung-Min on-pitch after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782328_1_20241206074358.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ange Postecoglou slammed Tottenham's flops as furious fans turned on the Australian and his spluttering side after Bournemouth condemned them to a shock 1-0 defeat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dean Huijsen netted in the first half at the Vitality Stadium to leave Postecoglou's troubled team with just one win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old defender's first goal in English football after his close-season move from Juventus exposed the flaws in Tottenham's error-prone defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacklustre Tottenham were fortunate not to lose by a bigger margin as Andoni Iraola's side wasted several chances to increase their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's sixth Premier League defeat this season was another setback for the under-fire Postecoglou after last weekend's disappointing 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not good enough. We again fell into the trap of starting the game really well and then we conceded a really poor goal," Postecoglou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's disappointing – we have this propensity to shoot ourselves in the foot when we should be controlling games," he went on to say. "It's something we've done consistently, and we always pay the price for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having wasted a golden opportunity to qualify for the Champions League last season, Postecoglou is beginning to hear criticism of his overly-attacking tactics and this dismal display will add to the Australian's doubters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are languishing in 10th place, six points adrift of the top four heading into Sunday's London derby against second-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fans have every right to be disappointed. I got some pretty direct feedback with the way that we are going at the moment and that is rightly so," Postecoglou said after he was jeered by Tottenham fans after the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't like what was being said, because I'm a human being but you're going to cop it," he added. "All I can say is I'm determined to get it right, and will keep fighting until we do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Bournemouth have now beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex Iwobi scored twice as Fulham took advantage of a howler from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen to beat the Seagulls 3-1 at Craven Cottage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Silva's men were gifted the lead in the fourth minute when Verbruggen, under minimal pressure, tried to pass to Carlos Baleba on the edge of the area, with Iwobi intercepting and slotting into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton levelled in the 56th minute when Baleba fired past Bernd Leno from 25 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Fulham went ahead again with 11 minutes remaining when Andreas Pereira's corner skimmed off Calvin Bassey and went in off Brighton's Matt O'Riley for an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iwobi's curler sealed the points with three minutes left as Fulham moved up to sixth place after their third win in their last five league games. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Olympic dressage gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin was on Thursday banned for a year following a horse-whipping controversy that led to her withdrawal from the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rider was provisionally suspended by governing body the International Federation for Equestrian Sports just days before the start of the Olympics in the French capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEI said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare", which showed her repeatedly striking a horse with a long whip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, who has also been fined 10,000 Swiss francs, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is now sidelined from all competition until July next year, with the suspension backdated to July 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "British Equestrian and British Dressage have reciprocated the suspension, resulting in Dujardin's ineligibility to compete in any national competition or training events during this period," the FEI said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, Britain's joint most-decorated female Olympian, has won six Olympic medals including individual gold in 2012 and 2016. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 121st-minute Dejan Ljubicic penalty took Cologne to a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin and a spot in the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hertha took the lead early when Ibrahim Maza converted a penalty after Derry Scherhant was felled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin's hopes took a hit soon after when Deyovaisio Zeefuik was red carded for a headbutt in the 25th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised five minutes later when Florian Niederlechner scored an own goal from a Cologne corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  With scores locked at 1-1, the match went to extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ljubicic missed a sitter inches from goal on the 100th-minute mark but made good on his error, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way, with penalties looming, to book Cologne's place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  2015 winners Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim 3-0 at home thanks to three goals in 22 second-half minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scoreless at half-time, Denis Vavro and Jonas Wind scored within four minutes of each other midway through the second half, before Yannick Gerhardt added a third to seal the game in the dying stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win continues Wolfsburg's improvement under former Southampton and RB Leipzig manager Ralph Hasenhuettl, with the Wolves now unbeaten in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lois Openda scored a brace as RB Leipzig roared back into form with a 3-0 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Cup last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig and their coach Marco Rose came into the game under pressure, after five losses and a draw during a winless November, against a Frankfurt side sitting second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayer Leverkusen, who eliminated 20-time winners Bayern Munich on Tuesday, have already booked their spot in the quarter-finals along with Stuttgart, Werder Bremen and Arminia Bielefeld, who are the sole third-division side in the final eight. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé said he will take full responsibility for a "big mistake" after the striker missed another penalty in champions Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after the French superstar failed from the spot in the Champions League against Liverpool, he endured further misery from 12 yards as Los Blancos allowed league leaders Barcelona to retain their four-point advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Berenguer fired Bilbao ahead early in the second half, with Jude Bellingham levelling for Madrid after Mbappé's penalty miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, substitute Gorka Guruzeta snatched fourth-place Athletic victory in the 80th minute after a Fede Valverde error.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat and Mbappé's penalty miss will heap further pressure on to the former Paris Saint-Germain striker's shoulders after plenty of criticism in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A big mistake in a match where every detail counts – I take full responsibility for it," said Mbappé in a post on social media network Instagram. "A difficult moment but it's the best time to change this situation and show who I am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward was downhearted after goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala saved his penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously (Mbappé) is sad, disappointed, but he has to continue," the Italian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has scored 10 goals in his first 20 games for Madrid across all competitions but is struggling for consistency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not at his best level but we have to give him time to adapt, he's scored 10 goals, he can do better and he's working to do that," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to build on three consecutive wins in La Liga, despite missing Vinicius Junior and other injured stars, with Ancelotti bringing French midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni back into the starting line-up. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League lead was cut to seven points by Arsenal and Chelsea after the Reds conceded a 90th-minute equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea thrashed 10-man Southampton 5-1 to go second on goal difference ahead of Arsenal, who beat Manchester United 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's second-half double was not enough to extend Liverpool's seven-game winning run in all competitions as they failed to win for just the third time in 21 games under Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league leaders were forced to come from behind at St James' Park twice, as Alexander Isak blasted Newcastle into a 1-0 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curtis Jones levelled before Anthony Gordon restored Newcastle's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah twice converted Trent Alexander-Arnold assists to turn the game around, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a late sting in the tale as a rare error from Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher allowed Fabian Schar to squeeze in a late equaliser for the Magpies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has done remarkably well for us and even today he was good. Unfortunately, he misjudged the situation," Liverpool boss Slot said of Kelleher's blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal took full advantage by inflicting Ruben Amorim's first defeat as Manchester United boss. Once again, the Gunners were able to rely on their prowess from set-pieces to get the job done.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jurrien Timber broke the deadlock, heading in Declan Rice's corner nine minutes into the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  William Saliba did not know much about the second, as he diverted in Thomas Partey's header from Bukayo Saka's corner, but the Frenchman did not care as Arsenal had the breathing space they craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fourth consecutive win in all competitions confirmed Arsenal's return to form and applied a little pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special day – it's a joy to play in this stadium with that energy, it's something incredible," Arteta said. "We scored two set-pieces, but we could've scored from open play many more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, meanwhile, said those set-pieces are what ultimately killed the game for United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put a lot of players near the goalkeeper, and it's almost impossible to fight for the ball," he said. "We already know we have to be better." (AFP)

    Man City thump Forest to snap seven-game winless run

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola said Manchester City had to break the habit of losing after snapping a seven-game winless streak by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' barren run included six defeats, the worst run of Guardiola's managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, victory came at a cost as defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji had to be replaced due to injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed it. The club, the players needed to win – but it is just one game," said Guardiola. "The problems continue with Manu and Nathan."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the most important thing was to break this routine of not winning games and finally we won," he added."But we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury woes have been at the heart of City's struggles in recent months with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out for the season due to a serious knee problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne's return to the starting line-up for the first time in nearly three months showed what City have been missing as he helped restore order for Guardiola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian teed up Bernardo Silva for an early opener and then fired home himself to double City's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku rounded off the scoring in the second half as the home side did not suffer a repeat of last week's collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola dismissed suggestions before the game that there had been a rift with De Bruyne, as he has been carefully managed back from injury problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last season he out injured for many months, and this season as well – I'm so happy he's back," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He fought a lot," he went on to say. "In respect to his physicality and minutes against Feyenoord was not good, and that's why I decided not to play against Liverpool for the rhythm they play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Akanji or Ake are expected to be fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday, but Phil Foden could return after missing the Forest match due to bronchitis. (AFP)

<img alt="Coleman Wong achieved the highest ever ranking recorded by a player from Hong Kong, at 128, on September 30. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782096_1_20241204170448.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top-ranked tennis player Coleman Wong on Wednesday said he is ready for the thrills that come with competing on home turf, as he gears up for his return to the Hong Kong Tennis Open at the end of the month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four of the world’s top 20 players have been announced as new additions to an already star-studded line-up, with Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, France’s Arthur Fils and Russia’s Karen Khachanov set to join defending champion Andrey Rublev on Victoria Park Centre Court from December 29 to January 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong, 20, remains unfazed by the prospect of competing among such star power, saying this has encouraged him to elevate his performance, and he's counting on the support of home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really like playing in front of a huge crowd,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m really looking forward to it, because last year I already had this experience and it was amazing – I recall the stadium being full when I played, so I’m really excited to be out there again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 170 enters the tournament coming off a rollercoaster of a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the year with an ATP ranking of 253, Wong qualified for his first Masters 1000 event in Miami back in March, and came within reach of the Hangzhou Open quarterfinals in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong rose to achieve the highest ever ranking recorded by a player from Hong Kong, at 128, on September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is confident in his ability and level of play ahead of the competition in Hong Kong – including the opportunity to compete against Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s such a good player,” said Wong. “He’s one of those guys I’ve watched videos of, and I’ve seen him quite a few times in other tournaments from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So I’m looking forward to hopefully playing against him in one of these rounds this coming competition.”

    Bayern knocked out of German Cup, Neuer sees first red

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich were dumped out of the German Cup by holders Bayer Leverkusen as Nathan Tella's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Bundesliga champions on Tuesday, after Manuel Neuer saw the first red card of his 866-game career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old rushed out of the box in typical fashion 18 minutes in to the German Cup last-16 clash, taking out an advancing Jeremie Frimpong and seeing a straight red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's sending-off brought Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz on for his Bayern debut, 18 months after joining the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern, who were already without the injured Harry Kane, dug deep despite the one-man disadvantage and dominated the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors eventually broke through in the 69th minute, though, with Tella heading in an Alex Grimaldo cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tella had only been on the field for eight minutes having come on for injured striker Patrik Schick, who himself was subbed on at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home winger Michael Olise lashed inches wide in the fourth minute of stoppage time but Leverkusen held on to inflict a first domestic defeat on Vincent Kompany since he became Bayern coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were too hectic and tried to go forward too quickly," Leverkusen captain Jonathan Tah said. "At half-time, we said we need to be patient – and we did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The red card decided the game," Neuer told reporters after the match. "It hurt us, and I'm sorry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who won an unbeaten league and cup double last season, are through to the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern have won the German Cup a record 20 times – 14 more than the next best – but have not made it past the quarter-finals since 2020, when they defeated Leverkusen 4-2 in the final. (AFP)

    Leicester, Palace record midweek Premier League wins

<img alt="Leicester striker Jamie Vardy celebrates after scoring his team's first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781986_1_20241204071347.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said he had been "astonished" by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester's eight but failed to make it count.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze's pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles' first away win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. (AFP)

    Barcelona return to winning ways at Mallorca

<img alt="Yamal returned to the Barca line-up after recovering from an ankle injury. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781977_1_20241204054235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raphinha and Lamine Yamal inspired Barcelona to a first win in four La Liga outings as they beat Mallorca 5-1 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive victory brings the Catalans to 37 points at the top of the league table, four ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, but with two extra matches played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish and European champions will have the chance to cut that lead back to one point on Wednesday when they travel to Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca stay sixth in La Liga, still two points behind Athletic Bilbao in the final Champions League spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres gave Barcelona the lead, before Vedat Muriqi equalised to ensure the sides were level at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha and Yamal lit up the second half as the away side ran riot with the Brazilian scoring a double, followed by strikes from Frenkie de Jong and Pau Victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona were boosted by the return of teenage starlet Yamal, who started the match after recovering from an ankle problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side dropped points in the two league outings Yamal missed, and were also defeated last time out at home to lowly Las Palmas when he was only fit enough to start on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts gifted Barca the lead in the 12th minute when panicked defending resulted in Torres being presented with a golden opportunity when there seemed to be no danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a trio of Majorcan defenders shepherded the ball back to their goalkeeper, full-back Johan Mojica suddenly decided to try to lash it away, only to smash the ball straight into Antonio Raillo and it fell perfectly to the feet of the Barcelona forward, who duly stroked home the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' high defensive line caught Mallorca out on several occasions as they tried to spring their attackers with passes over the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca were, however, starting to build pressure on Barcelona, though the visitors remained dangerous on the counter with their fleet-footed attacking quartet of Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Torres.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second goal in the match did not seem far away, for either side, and it came for the hosts in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inigo Martinez was deeper than the rest of the Barcelona line and Pablo Maffeo timed his run onto Sergi Darder's pass to perfection, before rolling the ball across to Muriqi to tap into an open net. (AFP)

    Petaia quits Australian rugby for NFL 'dream'

<img alt="Australia's Jordan Petaia (R) is tackled by Georgia's Mirian Modebadze during the France 2023 Rugby World Cup. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781859_1_20241203112910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian international Jordan Petaia said Tuesday he has quit rugby to chase his NFL dream, joining a growing list of players setting their sights on the lucrative American sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Petaia has earned 31 caps for the Wallabies since his 2019 debut, and is considered one of Australian rugby's most promising backline talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to step away from rugby hasn't been easy and one that took a great deal of consideration," the 24-year-old said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels like the right time in my career to pursue this dream I've had for a long time," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Kiss, Petaia's club coach at the Queensland Reds, said he was "one of the most dynamic players in Australia, if not the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL said Petaia had joined its International Player Pathway program, which gives stars from other sports the chance to be signed by one of 32 teams in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting in January, he will spend 10 weeks learning the game in Florida before he gets the chance to impress scouts at a "pro day" in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petaia follows in the footsteps of Australian Jordan Mailata, a little-known rugby league player signed by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018 after coming through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mailata, who has impressed during his six years with the Eagles, signed a US$66 million contract extension earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welsh speedster Louis Rees-Zammit stunned the rugby world in January when he quit the sport on the eve of the Six Nations and announced his NFL ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rees-Zammit was used sparingly in pre-season games, and was cut from the Kansas City Chiefs' 53-man playing roster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six athletes have made active rosters for NFL teams after completing the pathway program, according to the NFL. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round next month in a meeting of the competition's two most successful clubs.
 <br>
  <br>
  United are the holders after winning it for the 13th time last season, while Arsenal lifted the last of their record 14 trophies in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie is set for the weekend of January 11-12 at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City, winners in 2023 and runners-up in May, host fourth-tier Salford, owned by United's 'Class of 92' made up of David Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are also at home to League Two opponents in Accrington Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea play Morecambe, the fourth division's bottom side, while Newcastle play other League Two strugglers Bromley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham were drawn away to Tamworth, who are one of only two non-league clubs left in the competition. Fellow National League side Dagenham and Redbridge are away to second-tier Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the third round the 44 clubs from the Premier League and Championship enter the competition, joining the 20 lower-league and non-league sides who won in the previous round. (AFP)

 Italy will host the Davis Cup Finals from 2025 to 2027, the International Tennis Federation announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight-team men's event, called the "Final 8", was won this year by Jannik Sinner's Italy, who triumphed in Spain last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaga has hosted the event since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to partner with the FITP (Italian Tennis Federation) for the Davis Cup Final 8," said ITF president David Haggerty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Italy has a rich history in tennis and a proven ability to host world-class sporting events," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 finals will be staged in Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are thrilled to have been selected as hosts," Angelo Binaghi, president of the FITP, said. "We look forward to welcoming the best teams in the world to our country next November and for the next three years." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo watched on from the stands as already-qualified Al Nassr lost for the first time in this year's Asian Champions League Elite as they were beaten 2-1 in injury time by Qatar's Al Sadd on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese star, 39, was reportedly rested for the fixture in Riyadh given the Saudi club had secured their place in the knockout stages last week, with three rounds of the group phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo scored twice against Al Gharafa, another Qatari side, last time out, and then netted a double again in the Saudi Pro League on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Al Nassr captain was omitted from Stefano Pioli's matchday squad for the visit of Al Sadd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo, who has 15 goals in 18 appearances for his club this season, was spotted at Al Awwal Park sitting alongside his mother Dolores Aveiro and his partner Georgina Rodriguez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Sadd took the lead eight minutes into the second half through Akram Afif, when the reigning AFC Player of the Year raced from the halfway line onto a long ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif outpaced defender Mohammed Al Fatil and finishing low past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr drew level on 80 minutes, once Brazilian youngster Wesley's low cross was turned into his own goal by Al Sadd defender Romain Saiss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there would be a huge sting in the tail for Al Nassr, when Afif was tripped inside the hosts' penalty area and substitute Adam Ounas converted from the spot in the 99th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the defeat, Al Nassr stay third in the Western Region group stage, while Al Sadd move fourth to also claim a spot in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight teams qualify for the knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow Saudi side Al Ahli remain top – even if they surrendered their 100 percent record in this year's tournament – thanks to an Ivan Toney double that secured a 2-2 draw with Iran's Esteghlal in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England striker twice equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot, with the first coming deep into first-half injury time and the second converted in the 86th minute. Esteghlal had Mohammed Hossein Eslami sent off five minutes before.
  <br>
  <br>
  It represented a second successive Champions League Elite match in which Toney has scored twice following his double last week against Asian champions Al Ain. (AFP)

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell led all scorers with 35 points in the Cavs' victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781702_1_20241202112837.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers avenged a heartbreaking loss with a 115-111 victory over Boston on Sunday in a matchup of the NBA's top teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell scored 20 points in the fourth quarter as the Cavs rallied from 14 points down in the second half to defeat the reigning NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers started the season 15-0 but suffered their first loss at Boston last month by 120-117 and dropped their two prior games, both losses to Atlanta, before staging a fightback home triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, we've got to go out there and make a statement," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They beat us in the NBA Cup. No excuse. We've got to go out there and try to build – we had two losses that really hurt," he went on to say. "We weren't playing like ourselves – we needed this win."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 18-3 to stay atop the Eastern Conference while the Celtics fell to 16-4 as Cleveland snapped their seven-game win streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to trust your work and what we've been working on since training camp. That's the biggest thing," Mitchell said. "That's what you saw tonight, and that's what it's going to continue to be."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics were without starting guards Jaylen Brown due to illness and Derrick White with a sprained right foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because they've got two guys down, they've got a lot of guys who are capable," Mitchell said. "You've got to respect them – they're champions for a reason."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland led 51-49 at half-time but the Celtics dominated the third quarter for an 84-72 lead entering the fourth, Jayson Tatum scoring 17 of his 33 points in the third period to lead Boston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell responded for Cleveland, including a floater that gave the Cavs a 103-101 lead with 67 seconds remaining and concluded his run of 11 consecutive Cavaliers points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing is you've just got to pick your spots, find your moments throughout the game," said Mitchell. "They kind of went on a run and in the fourth quarter I started to make my imprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum missed a layup and Mobley followed with a dunk for a 105-101 Cavs lead. Porzingis responded with two free throws with 26 seconds to play but Mitchell sank two free throws of his own for a 107-103 Cavs lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teams traded free throws late until Pritchard deliberately missed one trying to get a rebound, but he committed a lane violation and Mitchell added two final free throws to seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end of the day, we executed on both ends of the floor," said Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I scored offensively but we were getting stops and finding ways to get rebounds, loose balls, different things," he added. "That's what ultimately ended up getting us the W." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Netherlands' Sifan Hassan and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo were named World Athletes of the Year on Sunday after they both scooped multiple medals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hassan won the women's marathon in an Olympic record time of 2.22:55. She also claimed bronze medals in the 10,000m and 5000m events.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to the fans, to everybody who voted," Hassan, also awarded women's out of stadium athlete of the year, said in Monaco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never thought I was going to win this one – this year was crazy," she added. "It's not only me, all the athletes have been amazing. I'm really grateful. What more can I say?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Tebogo, meanwhile, also made history in the French capital as he became the first African to win the Olympic men's 200-metre title and earned Botswana their first ever Olympic gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also set a national record of 9.86 when finishing sixth in the 100-metre final before being part of Botswana's silver medal-winning men's 4x400-metre team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels amazing to know that the fans are always there for us athletes. It was a great year," Tebogo, also named men's track athlete of the year, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This means a lot. It's not just about the team that is around you, there are a lot of fans out there that really want us to win something great for the continent," the 21-year-old went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a real surprise to hear my name because I didn't expect this." (Reuters)

    Eagles top Ravens, Steelers edge Bengals in Cincinnati

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday broke out of a tight encounter with the Baltimore Ravens to record their 10th win of the NFL season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star running back Saquon Barkley burst for a 25-yard rushing touchdown to put his team 21-12 up mid-way through the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-yard Jake Elliott field goal extended the lead to 12 points and although Lamar Jackson found Isaiah Likely with an 11-yard touchdown pass in the final seconds it was too late for a Ravens comeback as the Eagles won 24-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker's woes were evident again as he missed two field goals and an extra point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, enjoying an outstanding year after being traded by the New York Giants, put up 107 yards on 23 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geno Smith returned to haunt the New York Jets as he led the Seattle Seahawks to a 26-21 victory, clinched by Zach Charbonnet's 8-yard rushing score in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Jet Smith threw for 206 yards and a touchdown while opposite number Aaron Rodgers threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Pittsburgh quarterback Russell Wilson continued his renaissance, throwing for 414 yards and three touchdowns as the Steelers won 44-38 at the Cincinnati Bengals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson, a Super Bowl winner with Seattle in 2014, was released by Denver last year and signed on a one-year veteran minimum deal with the Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  But having earned the starting role in Pittsburgh ahead of Justin Fields, the 36-year-old is spearheading the team's strong push towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's 25-yard touchdown pass to Pat Freiermuth at the end of the third quarter was a reminder of his enduring quality, scrambling out of the pocket and finding his receiver with a fine pass on the run.
  <br>
  <br>
  That score gave the Steelers a 34-24 lead heading into the fourth, and a 21-yard fumble recovery returned by Payton Wilson put them in firm control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow threw two touchdowns in the final quarter, either side of a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal for the Steelers, Pittsburgh held on for a crucial win against their divisional rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers lead the AFC North on 9-3 with the Baltimore Ravens second on 8-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working for something and it matters to us, it matters, it was a great day," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are still learning, still growing – there is still a lot more to do," he added. (AFP)

    Man Utd thrash Everton to give Amorim perfect start

<img alt="Ruben Amorim during Man United's Premier League match against Everton. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781659_1_20241202053549.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim refused to rule out a top-four challenge after enjoying a dream home Premier League debut as Manchester United thrashed Everton 4-0 thanks to doubles from Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese's first Premier League game in charge at Ipswich last weekend showed how much work he has ahead as United blew an early lead to draw 1-1 at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they cut loose against another opponent struggling at the wrong end of the table to the delight of the home crowd as chants of Amorim's name rang around Old Trafford in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss made six changes from Thursday's rollercoaster 3-2 win over Bodo/Glimt and was rewarded with a performance full of attacking verve that has been so often lacking from the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  United are up to ninth place, within touching distance of the top four, and Amorim knows a challenge to qualify for the Champions League would be a good first impression at his new club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard for me. If I say no, you will say that I cannot be a Manchester United coach," he said. "I said this many times, I will be judged about the place that we finish. I know that. But let's focus just on the next game and look at the performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford has found his form under the new boss with three goals in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international opened the floodgates on 34 minutes when his effort deflected in off Jarrad Branthwaite.
  <br>
  <br>
  United had tried to sign Branthwaite during the summer transfer window, but his first half to forget continued when he was dispossessed by Amad Diallo before Zirkzee struck his first goal since the opening day of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored inside two minutes of Amorim's first two games in charge, United this time took just seconds to net from the restart for the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo played in Rashford, who showed impressive pace and then poise to beat Jordan Pickford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee had netted just once in 18 previous appearances since joining from Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman looked a different player after the confidence boost of his first goal and rounded off the scoring after the impressive Diallo again won possession and provided the assist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts United up to ninth and within four points of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much tougher challenges are to come, starting with a daunting trip to Arsenal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for a fan base starved of excitement in recent times, Amorim's home Premier League bow delivered exactly what United supporters craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim saluted the influential Diallo's contribution to United's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really good again. He's in a great moment, but that moment starts with Ruud (van Nistelrooy). I just take advantage of his work with Amad," he said.

  <br>
  "He was really good defending and really good attacking, so he has to continue to play like that," Amorim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, Everton remain just two points above the relegation zone ahead of a devilishly difficult run of fixtures over the festive period. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool opened up a nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League as Manchester City's crisis deepened in a 2-0 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo's 12th-minute goal was scant reward for the Reds' first-half domination and they sealed an 18th win in 20 games under Arne Slot thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are now 11 points off the runaway leaders down in fifth and winless in seven games, including six defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal and Chelsea are Liverpool's closest challengers as City appear set to lose their crown as English champions after winning an unprecedented four consecutive titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola was taunted with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning" in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The City boss responded by showing six fingers, one for each of his Premier League title wins in the past seven seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola insisted he is not living in the past as he looks to turnaround the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you win you laugh, when they win, they laugh. It's part of the game," said Guardiola on his interaction with the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it will be so difficult to repeat (winning the title) this season but all the club, we will reflect together, to try and come back strong," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only point since October 26 even felt like a defeat as they blew a 3-0 lead in the final 15 minutes to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord in the Champions League in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola responded by dropping goalkeeper Ederson, while Kyle Walker and Ruben Dias were restored to the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no response from the defending champions as they were blown away in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  City could barely get out of their half in the opening quarter and the goal duly arrived when Gakpo bundled in Salah's enticing cross to the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk hit the post and powered another big headed chance inches wide as the chances continued to come for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even during City's finest seasons under Guardiola, they have struggled to contain the power of the Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's only away win against Liverpool since 2003 remains behind closed doors during the coronavirus-impacted 2021/22 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today really stood out," said Slot on whether this was his finest day as Liverpool boss to day. "The culmination of the energy we had and the energy the crowd had."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men did at least manage to stem the bleeding either side of half-time, but should still have been punished several times on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefan Ortega saved from Gakpo and Trent Alexander-Arnold, either side of a stunning Salah miss when one-on-one with the German goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another turnover deep inside their own half finally cost City the decisive second goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah had fired wide from the spot in Wednesday's 2-0 Champions League win over Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Egyptian found the bottom corner for his 13th goal of the season to round off Liverpool's dream week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But they were able to win every single three days," he said. "We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola emptied Jeremy Doku, Savinho, Jack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne off the bench in the second half in search of a lifeline.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, City's reliance on Erling Haaland for goals was again evident as he was marked out of the game by Van Dijk, who had been imperious until a late lapse of concentration should have gifted City a consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He presented the ball to De Bruyne, but he could not beat the in-form Caoimhin Kelleher. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Olympic fencing champions Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong are among the winners of the annual Fencing World Cup, after topping the rankings of their respective disciplines over the past season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair received their awards at this year's International Fencing Federation Congress in Uzbekistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the end of the 2023-24 season, Cheung topped the men's foil table for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won gold at the Paris Olympics for the SAR and finished on top of Grand Prix events in Turin and Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to win this award, and I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has helped and supported me," Cheung wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kong, who announced her retirement from professional fencing after winning gold in the Olympics, she returned to the world number one spot in women's individual epee.
  <br>
  <br>
  She made history at the Paris Games, clinching the first-ever gold medal in the individual epee event for Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kong also reached the top of the rankings in the 2018-19 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team's fencing coach, Greg Koenig, attended the ceremony and called the pair "the pride of Hong Kong".

<img alt="Bournemouth's Justin Kluivert celebrates scoring a third goal with Milos Kerkez and Marcus Tavernier. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781574_2_20241201073101.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal thrashed West Ham 5-2 on Saturday to climb up to second in the Premier League, while Justin Kluivert scored the first ever Premier League hat-trick of penalties in Bournemouth's 4-2 win at Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have struck 13 goals in a week to refind their form and cut the gap to runaway leaders Liverpool, who host struggling defending champions Manchester City in Sunday's blockbuster clash, to six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are back to our best form. We look fluid and dynamic we are all enjoying football right now," said Bukayo Saka, who shone with a goal and two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a top week for us. We have built a lot of momentum and we want to go on to the next few games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal scored four times before the break in a 6-0 rout at the London Stadium last season and went one better this time as all the goals came in a manic first half,
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes' threat from set-pieces is well-known but the Brazilian was inexplicably not picked up to head in Saka's corner on 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka then teed up Leandro Trossard to double the lead before he stepped aside for Martin Odegaard to score Arsenal's third from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz slotted in from Trossard's pass to make 4-0 after just 36 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another heavy home defeat increased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers flickered into life with two goals in two minutes through Aaron Wan-Bissaka and a brilliant Emerson Palmieri free-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Saka restored the three-goal advantage from the spot after Gabriel was felled from another corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made history at Molineux to curtail Wolves' mini-revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were three goals inside eight minutes as the Dutchman opened the scoring, Jorgen Strand Larsen replied for Wolves before Milos Kerkez made it 2-1 for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kluivert made it 3-1 just 10 minutes later and completed his hat-trick 16 minutes from time after Evanilson also set a record by winning a third penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was not completely sure I should allow him to take the third one," said Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is difficult, every time you shoot the first one, you give information to the keeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen pulled another goal back for Wolves, but Gary O'Neil's men slip back into the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford continued their stunning home form to thrash Leicester 4-1 in front of the Foxes' in-coming manager Ruud van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facundo Buonanotte had put the visitors in front in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brentford roared back to make it six wins and one draw from seven home league games this season -- the best points return in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa started the comeback before Schade took centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German had only scored two Premier League goals since joining the Bees in 2023 but matched that tally before half-time to put the home side in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schade then rounded off the scoring to show Van Nistelrooy the scale of the task that awaits him ahead of his first game in charge at home to West Ham on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The shining star today was Kevin Schade," said Brentford manager Thomas Frank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I celebrated so much his first because I know how hard it's been for him because he's had so many injuries and he's wanting to play in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood's emphatically struck penalty was enough to get Forest back to winning ways and leave Ipswich still in the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace edged out of the relegation zone on goal difference thanks to late drama in a 1-1 draw against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marc Guehi, who had been the subject of multiple bids from Newcastle during the transfer window, put the Magpies in front early in the second half with an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the England defender redeemed himself as from his cross Daniel Munoz powered home a header at the back post. (AFP)

    Saudi Arabia all but certain to host 2034 World Cup
   </title>

<img alt="Saudi Arabia is planning massive sports infrastructure projects if its bid is successful. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781554_1_20241130214244.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Saudi Arabia's bid to host the 2034 World Cup was considered "medium risk" for human rights by Fifa in its evaluation report, which said implementing reforms could take "significant time and effort."
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the report on Saturday comes ahead of the Fifa Congress on December 11, when a vote will be held to select the hosts for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia is the lone candidate for 2034 while Morocco, Spain and Portugal have formed a joint bid for the 2030 tournament, with Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay all set to host a match as part of the centenary edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid "presents a very strong all-round proposition, reflected in the results of the technical evaluation, which assesses the proposed infrastructure (both sporting and general) as well as its commercial potential," Fifa said in its report.
  <br>
  <br>
  But football's world governing body cautioned, "in terms of human rights, the undertaking involved in implementing the various measures... particularly in certain areas, could involve significant effort and time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifa said that was the basis for the elevated risk rating for a bid that received an average score of 4.2 out of 5 – higher than the combined bid by the United States, Canada and Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to note that the bid involves significant opportunities for positive human rights impact," added Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is good potential that the tournament could serve as a catalyst for some of the ongoing and future reforms and contribute to positive human rights outcomes for people in Saudi Arabia and the region that go beyond the scope of the tournament itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia has yet to build several proposed stadiums for a tournament that could be held in winter, as was the case in Qatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Human rights, a source of deep controversy at the 2022 World Cup in neighbouring Qatar, threatens to become a major talking point once again in the run-up to 2034.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights groups highlight mass executions in Saudi Arabia and allegations of torture, as well as restrictions on women under the conservative country's male guardianship system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Free expression is severely restricted, with some people handed lengthy jail terms over critical posts on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia, which is hosting several high-profile events including Formula One and the WTA Finals tennis, is often accused of "sportswashing" – using sport to divert attention from its rights record. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Africa had to overcome determined resistance from Sri Lanka's batsmen before winning the first Test by 233 runs at Kingsmead on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set a massive 516 runs to win, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 282.
  <br>
  <br>
  Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen, the destroyer in Sri Lanka's record-low first innings of 42, took four for 73 to finish with match figures of 11 for 86.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast to the first innings, the tourists made the South Africans work for their wickets on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dinesh Chandimal (83) and captain Dhananjaya de Silva (59) put on 95 for the sixth wicket and kept South Africa in the field for most of the morning after resuming at 101 for five.
  <br>
  <br>
  The breakthrough for South Africa came when De Silva chipped a catch to midwicket off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kusal Mendis made an attacking 48 before he became Jansen's 10th victim of the match, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal and De Silva took advantage of the best batting conditions of the match against bowlers who were not as effective as they had been when the ball was shiny and new.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were also without all-rounder Wiaan Mulder, who was ruled out of the rest of the series with a broken finger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chandimal, who was 29 not out overnight, continued to defy the bowlers on the ground where he marked his Test debut with two half-centuries 13 years ago. He made his 83 off 174 balls before being caught and bowled by Gerald Coetzee. (AFP)

    'Perfect time to develop sports as an industry'

<img alt="Patrick Lau says the government should do more promotion on sports and legal knowledge. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781529_1_20241130153943.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A sports professor at the Hong Kong Baptist University on Saturday said now is the best time for Hong Kong to develop sports as an industry and that promoting sports arbitration would be crucial.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee mentioned in his Policy Address that the government will look into establishing a sports dispute resolution system and promoting sports arbitration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Lau from the university's Department of Sport, Physical Education and Health said Hong Kong athletes had some great achievements at international events recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the city's sports sector had experienced controversial issues, relating to athlete selection mechanisms, sports associations making use of government funds, and compensation for sports injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau urged the government to do more promotion on sports and legal knowledge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although other regions in Asia have set up institutions for sports arbitration, Hong Kong has advantages in internationalisation and its legal talents," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with mature infrastructures and financial supporting facilities, I believe Hong Kong can finish strong and become an important place in Asia for sports arbitration."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau said the SAR government lacks systematic planning for sports development, and he urged the authorities to set up long-term plans every five years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 De'Andre Hunter scored 23 points off the bench as the Atlanta Hawks beat league-leading Cleveland again on Friday to advance in the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks, who handed the Cavs their first home defeat of the season on Wednesday, came out on top at home, parlaying a 52-50 halftime lead into a 117-101 triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was enough to put Atlanta into the NBA Cup knockout rounds as winner of their group after the Boston Celtics beat the Bulls 138-129 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 21 points and handed out 11 assists and Jalen Johnson chipped in 20 points for Atlanta, who had six players score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 29 points for Cleveland and Evan Mobley added 24 points for the Cavs, who opened the season on a 15-0 tear and at 17-3 still boast the best record in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hawks held Cavs star Donovan Mitchell to 12 points and out-scored Cleveland 39-23 in the third quarter to take control for good in the contest that was one of 10 NBA Cup group stage games scheduled on the Thanksgiving holiday on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They outplayed us," Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said after the Cavaliers were held to their lowest points total of the season. "Sometimes you just have to call it like you see it."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers, who won the inaugural edition of the Cup last season, were essentially eliminated from the in-season tournament after falling 101-93 to the Oklahoma City Thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 15 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter for Oklahoma City, draining a three-pointer that put the Thunder up 95-91 with 1:35 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added a pair of free throws and Jalen Williams came up with a steal and a dunk as the Thunder kept the Lakers at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dalton Knecht was the Lakers' top scorer with 20 points. Anthony Davis added 15 and LeBron James scored 12 points but produced five of the Lakers' 17 turnovers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBA champion Celtics, meanwhile, maintained their wildcard hopes with their win over the Bulls – who came into their game fighting the Hawks for group supremacy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 35 points and pulled down 14 rebounds and reserve Payton Pritchard scored 19 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to help Boston pull away in a see-saw battle that featured 14 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown and Kristaps Porzingis scored 21 points apiece for the Celtics while Nikola Vucevic led the Bulls with 32 points and 11 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks, buoyed by Jalen Brunson's fourth-quarter heroics, improved to 3-0 in Cup play with a 99-98 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hornets challenged despite missing five of their top six scorers, with LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Tre Mann, Grant Williams, Mark Williams and Nick Richards all sidelined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Outside looking in, you're thinking they've got some key guys out, so this is supposed to be an easy game. That's not how the NBA works," New York's Josh Hart told reporters after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson scored 11 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter, draining a pair of free throws with 8.6 seconds left that pushed New York's lead to four points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win left the Knicks tied atop their group with Orlando, who beat the Brooklyn Nets 123-100. The Knicks and Magic will face off for the group crown on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Franz Wagner scored 29 points with eight rebounds and eight assists to fuel the Magic in their fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 19 points for Orlando, who had little trouble with a Nets team missing top-scorer Dennis Schroder – who was absent for personal reasons – and injured playmaker Cam Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Minnesota Timberwolves halted their four-game losing streak with a 93-92 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards connected on just seven of 21 shots from the field but led the Timberwolves with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a terrible game tonight," said Edwards, adding that Minnesota's defence carried the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively I think we dominated the game," he said. (AFP)

    VAR breaks Southampton hearts in Brighton

<img alt="Southampton's Flynn Downes celebrates scoring the visitors' first goal against Brighton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781500_1_20241130095714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton were denied victory by a controversial VAR decision in a 1-1 draw at high-flying Brighton on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Flynn Downes had just cancelled out Kaoru Mitoma's opener for Brighton when Cameron Archer thought he had put the Saints 2-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR check of more than four minutes eventually decided Archer was onside but penalised Adam Armstrong, who was offside but did not touch the ball, for interfering with play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton had to settle for a first away point of the season as a result and remain bottom of the table, four points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point was enough to lift Brighton up to second on alphabetical order ahead of Manchester City, who face leaders Liverpool in the pick of the weekend's action on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were left to rue not making more of a dominant first-half display.
  <br>
  <br>
  Georginio Rutter hit the post and fired another effort wide, while Mitoma wasted a huge chance in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's pressure finally paid off on the half hour mark when Mitoma stooped to head in Tariq Lamptey's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton levelled 13 minutes into the second half with the impressive Tyler Dibling the architect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The teenager's square ball teed up Armstrong, whose shot was blocked, but the loose ball found its way to Downes, who hammered home first time from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight minutes later Dibling wriggled clear of three Brighton players inside his own half and then spread the ball to Fraser.
  <br>
  <br>
  His low cross evaded Armstrong and was finished at the far post by Archer - only to be chalked off to the dismay of boss Russell Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm fed up talking about decisions," said Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were told it affects Bart Verbruggen ability (to play the ball) and if Adam's run moved Verbruggen from his position then I would understand the decision, but he hasn't moved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cannot see how it has affected the goalkeeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The VAR delay led to 13 minutes of added time and Brighton nearly snatched victory at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Adingra's effort on the stretch flicked off the outside of the far post. (AFP)

    Halep blasts tennis doping body for Swiatek leniency

<img alt="Simona Halep is angry because Iga Swiatek seems to have been let off lightly for a similar offence. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781458_1_20241129204705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romania's Simona Halep on Friday rounded on the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) for discrepencies in the treatment of world number two Iga Swiatek after testing positive for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA announced a one-month ban on Thursday for Swiatek after the 23-year-old had tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now 33, returned to tennis in March this year after her own career had been on hold since October 7, 2022, the date of the start of her provisional suspension after testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon singles titles was then caught up in a second affair, this time "irregularities" in the data of her biological passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA, but Halep successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February, arguing her positive test for roxadustat – used to treat anaemia and banned as a blood doping agent – was the result of a tainted supplement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wonder why there is such a difference in treatment and judgement? I don't find and I don't think there can be a logical answer," Halep said in a long message posted in Romanian on her Instagram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can only be bad will on the part of the ITIA, the organisation that did everything to destroy me despite the evidence. It wanted at all costs to destroy the last years of my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep, now sitting 877th in the world rankings, added: "I suffered, I suffer and I will perhaps always suffer from the injustice that was done to me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How is it possible that in identical cases taking place at roughly the same time, the ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?
  <br>
  <br>
  "I lost two years of my career, I suffered many sleepless nights, thoughts, anxiety, unanswered questions... but I got justice. It turned out that it was a contamination and that (the anomaly in my) biological passport was pure invention." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Premier League side Eastern on Thursday night crashed out of contention in the AFC Champions League Two – Asia's second-tier club football tournament – suffering a 4-1 defeat to Australian side Sydney FC in their Group E match-up at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sydney jumped out to a commanding 3-0 lead in the first half, thanks to an early goal from Moroccan striker Anas Ouahim in the fifth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed up by a 16th-minute half-volley by Patryk Klimala, as Ouahim deflected a shot for Sydney's third goal to close out the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastern striker Noah Baffoe pulled one goal back for the home team with a glancing header from a free kick in the 49th.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Ouahim's individual brilliance that sealed the victory for the Australians, scoring a penalty in the 62nd minute to secure the first-ever hat-trick of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one round left, the win guarantees Sydney's progression to the last 16 of the continental competition for just the second time in the club’s history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They next face Philippine side Kaya FC in their final group match on December 5, while Eastern will travel to Hiroshima to play Japan side Sanfrecce on the same day.

<img alt="Jansen holds the ball after taking seven wickets in the first innings. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781315_1_20241129075058.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marco Jansen bowled South Africa into a dominant position as Sri Lanka crashed to 42 all out, their lowest total in Test cricket, on the second day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The left-arm fast bowler took seven for 13 as Sri Lanka were bowled out in 13.5 overs – the second-shortest completed Test innings in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  It gave South Africa a first innings lead of 149 after they had been dismissed for a modest 191 in their first innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts stretched their lead to 281 runs when they scored 132 for three in their second innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the 2.06-metre Jansen, one of the tallest players in international cricket, admitted that he struggled to control the ball at the start of his spell with a strong wind blowing across the ground being a "massive factor".
  <br>
  <br>
  Having played only in eight T20 matches since returning from a three-month "conditioning break", the 24-year-old Jansen sent down a wide and a no-ball before opening batsman Pathum Nissanka had to put bat on ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I struggled to get my wrist behind the ball. It felt like I was battling something but I just tried to make it work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kagiso Rabada made the breakthrough for South Africa when he had Dimuth Karunaratne caught at first slip before Jansen, in his second over, bowled a delivery close enough to Nissanka to induce an edge to third slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked an inspired spell. Jansen's pace and bounce, allied with the ability to make the ball swing in as a variation to his natural angle across right-handed batsmen, proved devastating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he still bowled another two no-balls. After at least two of his wickets he looked back anxiously at the umpire to make sure he hadn't over-stepped again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said, though, that once he found his rhythm, "the ball was moving nice and quickly off the pitch. We knew if we put the ball in the right areas we would always be in the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his break from cricket, ordered by Cricket South Africa, had refreshed him mentally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel I can go for longer periods of time, concentrating at a high level," said Jansen. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund scored twice as Manchester United won a chaotic Uefa Europa League encounter against Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, giving Ruben Amorim a vital win in his first home game at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho gave the home side a lightning start after a shocking error from opposition goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hakon Evjen levelled for the Norwegians and Philip Zinckernagel surged down the right wing to give them a shock lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hojlund pulled United level with a superb finish just before half-time and poked them ahead early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  New United boss Amorim said the match was a "real ride" and that he was on a steep learning curve as he gets to know his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I see what everybody sees – good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end trying to hold the result, but the lads did a great job," Amorim said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ran, they pressed, they tried to do the thing we worked for these three days and we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he said he was touched by the reception he was given by the home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn't know me, doesn't really know me," he added. "I came from Portugal. I did nothing for this love yet so the way they made me feel at home, it's so special."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who has said his methods will take time to implement, made six changes from the side that laboured to a 1-1 draw against Ipswich in his first game in charge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrell Malacia returned to the United line-up for the first time since the final game of the 2022 to 2023 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt also made multiple changes with one eye on domestic matters – they are top of the Norwegian league table by a point with one match to come. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, 23, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA, however, accepted that it was caused by "the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication (melatonin), manufactured and sold in Poland that the player had been taking for jet lag and sleep issues".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violation was therefore not intentional – the player's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for 'No Significant Fault or Negligence'," the ITIA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning French Open champion Swiatek, who has five Grand Slam singles titles – four at Roland Garros and the 2022 US Open – accepted the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm finally allowed – so I instantly want to share with you something that became the worst experience of my life," an emotional Swiatek said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the last two-and-a-half months I was subject to strict ITIA proceedings, which confirmed my innocence," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive doping test in my career, showing unbelievably low level of a banned substance I've never heard about before, put everything I've worked so hard for my entire life into question.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both me and my team had to deal with tremendous stress and anxiety. Now everything has been carefully explained, and with a clean slate I can go back to what I love most."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek was provisionally suspended from September 22 until October 4, missing three tournaments, which counts towards the sanction, leaving eight days remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will also forfeit prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I will be stronger than ever," continued Swiatek. "Right now I'm just relieved it's over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be open with you, even though I know I did nothing wrong. Out of respect for my fans and the public, I'm sharing all the details of this longest and toughest tournament of my career," she went on to say. "My biggest hope is that you will stay with me." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Detroit Lions survived a late rally from the Chicago Bears, with a little piece of good fortune, to make it ten wins a row with a 23-20 win on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening game of a trio of Thanksgiving Day clashes went down to the wire but Chicago made a mess of their final possession, allowing Detroit to move to 11-1 on the season for the first time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions had led 16-0 at the half after three field goals and a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Sam LaPorta.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bears fought back strongly with three touchdowns in the second half – two of them on the connection between quarterback Caleb Williams and receiver Keeman Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Williams found D.J. Moore with a superb 31-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter, the Lions' advantage was reduced to three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago forced Detroit to punt on the next possession, leaving Williams with the ball and the chance to take the game to overtime or win it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of penalties hampered the Bears' final drive but despite Williams taking a sack with 36 seconds left in the game, a field goal opportunity remained well within reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  But instead of taking a timeout, the Bears offense tried to set up to gain some more yards for kicker Cairo Santos losing precious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was snapped with just six seconds left and Williams threw an incomplete pass as the clock ran out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bears, who suffered their sixth straight loss, looked confused and frustrated while the sense of relief was evident on the faces of the Lions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a crazy ending and we fought hard to the end to get it done – but it was scary," admitted Goff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our defense held strong. Our defense, they'll bend not break and they made those plays at the end there and we win," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared Goff went 21-for-34 for 221 yards and two touchdowns while on the ground, the running back pair Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery put up 175 yards between them. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leaders the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered their first home loss of the season with a surprise 135-124 defeat to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's second loss of the season came afer a strong second half display from Atlanta with De'Andre Hunter scoring 26 points off the bench, Jalen Johnson adding 22 points and Trae Young contributing 20 with a career-high 22 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young put the game beyond the Cavs with a 39-foot three pointer to make it 129-122 with just under two minutes remaining, moments after he had turned the ball over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson said Young's assists had been crucial to the victory, and that he deserved more credit for his role on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really getting off the ball and finding everyone," Johnson said. "A lot of people don't necessarily talk about him, even though he's leading the league in assists – but they don't talk about him as the playmaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win moves the Hawks to 8-11 on the season, and Young said the team had shown what they were capable of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a really good team who have been playing well all year, and I feel we have been a little inconsistent but the times that we have played well, we've played really well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 30 for Cleveland and Evan Mobley put up 22 points and 13 rebounds, but the Cavs missed out on a chance to become the first team to start with an 18-1 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets needed overtime to beat the 3-14 Philadelphia 76ers, with Alperen Şengün scoring 22 points and claiming 14 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of Şengün's points came in overtime, where the Rockets made sure of moving to 14-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, James Harden scored 43 points for the Los Angeles Clippers as they beat the struggling Washington Wizards 121-96.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden scored 23 of his points in the first quarter, and left the game late in the third quarter with the Wizards already condemned to their 13th straight defeat. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Barcelona and Uruguay striker Luis Suárez has signed a one-year contract extension with the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and will line up under new coach Javier Mascherano next season, the team said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old striker has scored 25 goals in all competitions since joining the club before the start of this season including 20 in Miami's record-breaking regular season campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After winning the Supporters' Shield for the best record in the regular season, with a new points tally record, Miami were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then Argentina head coach Gerardo Martino has left the club with his compatriot and Suárez's former team-mate at Barca, Mascherano appointed on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy, very excited to continue for another year and to be able to enjoy being here with this fan base, which for us is like family," said Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel very, very connected with Suárez, and hopefully, next year, we can bring them even more joy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's president of football operations Raul Sanllehi said Suárez had shown he remains an elite level forward, but was also a key component in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luis was not only our leading scorer this season, but also a leader for the group. His impact cannot be understated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suárez announced in September he was retiring from international duty with the Uruguay national team after scoring 69 goals in 143 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward played in Europe for Ajax, Liverpool and Atlético Madrid and had a season in Brazil with Gremio before joining Miami. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly set to be appointed as Leicester City's new manager, various British media outlets said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy recently left Manchester United after a short spell as interim manager and serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on Sunday after just 12 Premier League games in charge, with the Foxes 16th in the table and only one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Van Nistelrooy's three wins in four games as United's caretaker boss in the past month came against Leicester in the League Cup and Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old Dutchman has previous managerial experience from one year in charge of PSV Eindhoven from 2022 to 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky Sports reported that he could even be appointed in time to lead Leicester in their next game away at Brentford on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a glorious playing career, most notably at PSV, Man United and Real Madrid. (AFP)

    Kumara gives Sri Lanka edge against South Africa

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lahiru Kumara struck twice as Sri Lanka's bowlers had the better of a rain-hit opening day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were 80 for four when rain stopped play for the day shortly before lunch. Fast bowler Kumara took wickets in successive overs to put his team on top – and was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot in favour of the bowling team and they bowled well. The deliveries that got wickets were all pretty decent," said South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a skilled bowling line-up and obviously they have done their homework," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan bowling coach Darshana Gamage said pace was Kumara's biggest asset. With a history of hamstring injuries, he is now being used as a Test specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this Test championship, we wanted to have all our bowlers fresh," said Gamage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our biggest challenge is to have quicks who will win us Test matches and I can say that we have the nucleus now to do the job away from home," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka's decision to bowl first on a well-grassed pitch paid off under a heavily overcast sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Namesakes Ajitha and Vishwa Fernando dismissed both South Africa's openers with the total on 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tristan Stubbs and South African captain Temba Bavuma defended doggedly, taking the total to 29 after 13 overs.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a flurry of scoring when Kumara came into the attack in the 14th over, with 17 runs added off his first over – four leg-byes, a no-ball and three boundaries by Stubbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the strongly-built Kumara found extra bounce with the first ball of his second over, having Stubbs caught at third slip for 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather is expected to clear from Thursday and Prince said South Africa were in a reasonable position, referring to the first Test between Australia and India in Perth last weekend when two low first innings totals were followed by a strong Indian second-innings performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-Test series is crucial to both sides' hopes of reaching next year's World Test Championship final at Lord's, with Sri Lanka sitting third in the table and South Africa fifth. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé saw a penalty saved as Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday to inflict a third Uefa Champions League defeat in five matches on the holders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored the goals in the second half as the Reds maintained their perfect record to return to the top of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah also fired wide from the spot, but it mattered little as Liverpool secured a 17th win in Arne Slot's first 19 games in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has already achieved what Jurgen Klopp could not as Liverpool boss by slaying the Spanish giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had a score to settle with Madrid, who were unbeaten in eight previous meetings between the sides, including Champions League finals against Klopp's men in 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat sends Carlo Ancelotti's side tumbling down to 24th in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the first minute they just took control of the game," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham, in what was a disappointing return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think they were more up for it than us, to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. It's a bad result against probably the best-performing team in Europe," he added. "It's no disgrace to come here and lose, but we are disappointed in how we performed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top 24 progress to the knockout stage with the top eight advancing directly to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are well on course to do just that and the confidence coursing through a side also eight points clear at the top of the Premier League was in evidence throughout in front of a highly-charged Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hamstrung by a lengthy injury list and made the trip to England without Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young centre-back Raul Asencio has been pressed into action by those absences and he made a vital goal-line clearance on four minutes. (AFP)

 Manchester City blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in a Champions League thriller on Tuesday and extend their winless run to six games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions did snap a five-game losing streak, but did little to boost confidence ahead of Sunday's trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool by conceding three times in the final 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola admitted his star-studded squad were "fragile" and lacking in confidence after the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two goals from Erling Haaland, either side of Ilkay Gundogan's deflected effort, looked set to restore some order for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defensive frailties that have been the root cause for a staggering collapse in recent weeks was exposed in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko hit back to salvage a vital point for the Dutch giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We concede a lot of goals because we are not stable," said Guardiola. "We lost a lot of games lately – we are fragile, and of course we need a victory."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game [at 3-0] was good for the confidence, playing at a good level and the first time something happens we have problems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draw leaves City with plenty of work to do to reach the knockout stages with trips to Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain to come in their next two Champions League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top eight progress directly to the last 16 with a place in the top 24 of the 36-team table enough to reach the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig meanwhile remain on no points after a fifth defeat in as many games in the Champions League, with even qualification for the play-offs looking tricky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal extended their revival with a ruthless 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side ended a three-match winless run in all competitions by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard netted late on to give Arsenal five away goals in a Champions League game for the first time since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's third win in five Champions League matches this season lifted them into seventh place, with the top eight teams in the revamped tournament earning automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting's first defeat in Europe's elite club competition this season leaves them below Arsenal on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their dip, but this swaggering effort suggested they are finally back in the groove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta had challenged Arsenal to make a statement against Sporting and they responded in emphatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners' first away win in the Champions League in six attempts was a welcome tonic after a 1-0 loss at Inter Milan in their last European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's impressive performance was all the more notable as Sporting had crushed Manchester City 4-1 in their final Champions League game under Ruben Amorim, who has since taken charge of Manchester United. (AFP)

    Bayern edge PSG to dent Champions League hopes

<img alt="Bayern Munich players celebrate after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780966_1_20241127071610.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A first-half header from Min-jae Kim guided Bayern Munich to a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, worsening the French side's hopes of progressing in the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre-back scored after an error from PSG goalkeeper Matvei Safonov, starting ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who spilled the ball into Kim's path.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean's effort was the only goal in the rematch of 2020's Champions League final, won by Bayern by the same scoreline, and all but extinguishes PSG's hopes of a top-eight finish and avoiding the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ousmane Dembele picked up a second yellow for an unnecessary challenge with half an hour remaining, with Bayern successfully shutting up shop as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just three games remaining, even making the knockouts is not a given for the French champions, who are in 26th spot – outside the playoff placings.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG host Manchester City in January along with facing tricky away trips to Red Bull Salzburg and Stuttgart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's top-eight hopes look rosier after the win, which extended their run of clean sheets to seven straight games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern now sit 11th and take on relative European minnows Shakhtar Donetsk, Feyenoord and Slovan Bratislava in their remaining games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides came into the game unbeaten and six points clear in their domestic leagues but in dire need of points in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern coach Vincent Kompany opted for the speed of Leroy Sane over the creativity of France winger Michael Olise up front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG boss Luis Enrique made five changes to his side but it was his decision to stick with goalkeeper Safonov, rather than Donnarumma, who had played all but one Champions League game this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enrique defended his call before the game, telling reporters "I make my choices based on what I see on the pitch and what's best for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision appeared to pay off early, with Safonov responsible for good saves from Jamal Musiala and Leroy Sane inside the opening 12 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kingsley Coman, the PSG academy product who scored the only goal in the 2020 final, almost broke the deadlock shortly afterwards, dribbling through five defenders and blasting just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After PSG had a few opportunities of their own, including Joao Neves' long-range effort whistling past the goalpost on 33 minutes, the Russian goalkeeper made a mistake which led directly to the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich swung in a corner on the 38-minute mark which Safonov spilled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim was on the spot to power an ascending header against Safonov's momentum and into the top left corner of the net, his first Champions League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern were happy to let the game come to them in the second-half but Dembele's second yellow – his first had come for dissent – took the steam out of PSG's hopes of a comeback. (AFP)

    Andrey Rublev hopes to swing another victory in HK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis sensation Andrey Rublev says he is looking forward to playing in Hong Kong again, emphasising that having a strong mindset sets the stage for his entire tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World No. 8 player is eager to defend his title at the Hong Kong Tennis Open 2025, which will take place from December 29 to January 5 at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev said he is excited for the event, adding that the unwavering support of the SAR fans and the welcoming environment boosted his comfort and motivation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great the atmosphere there last year. There was a lot of people who came from [the mainland] to watch me play and it was nice. It's a bit different compared to Europe audience because in general in Asia, they like to draw some posters," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They like to draw. Some put something on the face or to wear the flags or to wear some T-shirts with some signs. Last year, I remember there was a lot of people that had a flag with my photo and it was nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev exited the 2024 ATP Finals more than a week ago without securing a victory, having been defeated in his last match against Casper Ruud, but he said he is actively enhancing his physical abilities to boost his speed for the upcoming tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he opts to refrain from setting rigid goals to prevent burnout, and instead focuses on enjoying the sport he loves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working much more in a bit in a different direction and I start to feel that I'm doing this better, so I just want to keep doing that, to play better at the net because, especially now, there is many matches that somehow can be one or two points different and this one or two points different [is] because I didn't play well at the net and then the other guy, when he went to the net and I tried to pass him he played really well and that was the difference in the most important time and the most important moment of the match," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things like that with the serve with the changing a bit of the rhythm, I start to hit better because I start to feel that I'm doing it better. We'll see just to keep doing them because in the end, it's not about preseason. It's a bit like a daily routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to do it a bit every day. It doesn't matter if you're in a tournament or not. That's it. It's something that we were doing the last couple of months and it's just now preseason and we have even more time to do it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, DP World Tour Championship winner Rory McIlroy, and two-time major winner Xander Schuaffele were named Monday as 2024 PGA Tour Player of the Year award nominees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jack Nicklaus Award, named for the record 18-time major winner, and the Arnold Palmer Award for the PGA Rookie of the Year will be voted upon by PGA Tour members through December 4 with winners announced by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nominees for PGA Rookie of the Year include France's Matthieu Pavon and Americans Nick Dunlap, Jake Knapp and Max Greyserman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler and Schauffele are favorites in the top player race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler won Paris Olympic gold and captured seven titles on the PGA Tour, including his second Masters title in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old American also won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, the Heritage and Memorial tournaments, the Travelers Championship and the season-ending Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the season money leader and took the Byron Nelson Award for low scoring average at 68.645 strokes. He had 16 top-10 PGA finishes without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schauffele captured his first two major titles, winning the PGA Championship and the British Open, and the 31-year-old American was second in scoring average at 69.137. He had 15 top-10 efforts without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy won the Zurich Classic pairs event with Irishman Shane Lowry and his fourth Wells Fargo Championship on the PGA Tour and had 15 top-10s without a missed cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland almost captured his fifth major title and first since 2014 but settled for second at the US Open to Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the rookies, 20-year-old Dunlap was the surprise story. He won the American Express title as an amateur on a sponsor exemption in January, turned professional and then captured the Barracuda Championship, becoming the first player in tour history to win as a pro and amateur in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pavon, 32, won the Farmers Insurance Open and was third at Pebble Beach as well as fifth in the US Open. He was the only rookie to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knapp, 30, won his first PGA title at the Mexico Open while Greyserman, 29, was a three-time runner-up. (AFP)

    West Ham stun Newcastle to ease pressure on Lopetegui

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham produced a clinical away performance to beat resurgent Newcastle 2-0 on Monday, easing the pressure on beleaguered manager Julen Lopetegui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek headed the visitors in front against the run of play at St James' Park and Aaron Wan-Bissaka grabbed a rare goal in the second half to double the Hammers' lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle were unable to capitalise on the chances they created, failing to build on the momentum created by recent wins against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result, only West Ham's second win on the road this season, lifts them to 15 points, just three behind 10th-placed Newcastle, who missed out on the chance to move into the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made the early running and in-form forward Alexander Isak had the ball in the net in the fifth minute after a delicate dink over Lukasz Fabianski, only for it to be ruled out for offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham, expected to face a tough test on Newcastle's home turf, showed little adventure in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their first real foray up the pitch resulted in a corner and the unmarked Soucek powered home a header from close range in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle enjoyed the bulk of the possession as a lively first half unfolded but West Ham were robust in defence and threatened when they went forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon had a glorious chance to level after a poor clearance from Jean-Clair Todibo but fired straight at Fabianski.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes later Isak chested down a superb cross from Bruno Guimarães but steered narrowly wide on the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's Newcastle were again on the front foot at the start of the second half but it was West Ham who doubled their lead through Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United man scored his first goal for West Ham and just his third career goal after picking up Jarrod Bowen's pass and firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe brought on Jacob Murphy and Callum Wilson in a bid to turn the tide but Newcastle failed to build up a head of steam against their determined opponents, who saw out the game with relative ease. (AFP)

    Cadillac to join Formula 1 grid in 2026

<img alt='F1 had reached an "agreement in principle" with Cadillac owner General Motors. File photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780809_1_20241126073224.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American car manufacturer Cadillac will become the eleventh team on the Formula One grid in 2026, after the sport's owners announced Monday they had given their backing to the plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Formula 1 said it had reached "an agreement in principle" with General Motors (GM), which owns Cadillac, to support bringing a team into the paddock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Formula 1 has maintained a dialogue with General Motors, and its partners at TWG Global, regarding the viability of an entry following the commercial assessment and decision made by Formula 1 in January 2024," Formula One said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time," Formula One said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cars are expected to be powered by Ferrari before it develops its own engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Formula 1 rejected the bid which was headed up by Andretti – owned by Michael Andretti, son of 1978 world champion Mario Andretti – earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly a fortnight ago, GM announced it had registered with the FIA to become a Formula One engine manufacturer from 2028, offering support to Andretti's bid to join the F1 grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Andretti name has since been dropped from the proposal with Michael no longer involved, although Mario is understood to be taking on an ambassadorial role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an honour for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world's premier racing series, and we're committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world," said GM president Mark Reuss.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US has become an increasingly important stop on the F1 tour. This announcement comes less than 48 hours after the Las Vegas Grand Prix which, after Miami and Austin, is the third US race on the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netflix series 'Drive to Survive' has also boosted the sport's profile in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who had been in favour of the original Andretti bid, said he was "fully supportive" of the arrival of the GM/Cadillac team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All parties, including the FIA, will continue to work together to ensure the process progresses smoothly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefano Domenicali, the president and CEO of Formula 1, described the news as "an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport".
