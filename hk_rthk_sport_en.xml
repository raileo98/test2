<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund scored twice as Manchester United won a chaotic Europa League encounter against Bodo/Glimt 3-2 on Thursday, giving Ruben Amorim a vital win in his first home game at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho gave the home side a lightning start after a shocking error from opposition goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hakon Evjen levelled for the Norwegians and Philip Zinckernagel surged down the right wing to give them a shock lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hojlund pulled United level with a superb finish just before half-time and poked them ahead early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  New United boss Amorim said the match was a "real ride" and that he was on a steep learning curve as he gets to know his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I see what everybody sees – good moments, difficult moments, some confusion in the end trying to hold the result, but the lads did a great job," Amorim said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They ran, they pressed, they tried to do the thing we worked for these three days and we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he said he was touched by the reception he was given by the home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first thing is that half of the stadium doesn't know me, doesn't really know me," he added. "I came from Portugal. I did nothing for this love yet so the way they made me feel at home, it's so special."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss, who has said his methods will take time to implement, made six changes from the side that laboured to a 1-1 draw against Ipswich in his first game in charge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrell Malacia returned to the United line-up for the first time since the final game of the 2022 to 2023 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt also made multiple changes with one eye on domestic matters – they are top of the Norwegian league table by a point with one match to come. (AFP)

    Poland's Swiatek accepts one-month doping suspension

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek has accepted a one-month suspension after testing positive for a banned substance, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, 23, tested positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, when the Polish player was ranked number one in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ITIA, however, accepted that it was caused by "the contamination of a regulated non-prescription medication (melatonin), manufactured and sold in Poland that the player had been taking for jet lag and sleep issues".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The violation was therefore not intentional – the player's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range for 'No Significant Fault or Negligence'," the ITIA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning French Open champion Swiatek, who has five Grand Slam singles titles – four at Roland Garros and the 2022 US Open – accepted the suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm finally allowed – so I instantly want to share with you something that became the worst experience of my life," an emotional Swiatek said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the last two-and-a-half months I was subject to strict ITIA proceedings, which confirmed my innocence," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only positive doping test in my career, showing unbelievably low level of a banned substance I've never heard about before, put everything I've worked so hard for my entire life into question.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both me and my team had to deal with tremendous stress and anxiety. Now everything has been carefully explained, and with a clean slate I can go back to what I love most."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek was provisionally suspended from September 22 until October 4, missing three tournaments, which counts towards the sanction, leaving eight days remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will also forfeit prize money from the Cincinnati Open, the tournament directly following the test, where she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I will be stronger than ever," continued Swiatek. "Right now I'm just relieved it's over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be open with you, even though I know I did nothing wrong. Out of respect for my fans and the public, I'm sharing all the details of this longest and toughest tournament of my career," she went on to say. "My biggest hope is that you will stay with me." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Detroit Lions survived a late rally from the Chicago Bears, with a little piece of good fortune, to make it ten wins a row with a 23-20 win on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The opening game of a trio of Thanksgiving Day clashes went down to the wire but Chicago made a mess of their final possession, allowing Detroit to move to 11-1 on the season for the first time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions had led 16-0 at the half after three field goals and a 3-yard touchdown pass from Jared Goff to Sam LaPorta.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bears fought back strongly with three touchdowns in the second half – two of them on the connection between quarterback Caleb Williams and receiver Keeman Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Williams found D.J. Moore with a superb 31-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter, the Lions' advantage was reduced to three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago forced Detroit to punt on the next possession, leaving Williams with the ball and the chance to take the game to overtime or win it.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of penalties hampered the Bears' final drive but despite Williams taking a sack with 36 seconds left in the game, a field goal opportunity remained well within reach.
  <br>
  <br>
  But instead of taking a timeout, the Bears offense tried to set up to gain some more yards for kicker Cairo Santos losing precious time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was snapped with just six seconds left and Williams threw an incomplete pass as the clock ran out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bears, who suffered their sixth straight loss, looked confused and frustrated while the sense of relief was evident on the faces of the Lions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a crazy ending and we fought hard to the end to get it done – but it was scary," admitted Goff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our defense held strong. Our defense, they'll bend not break and they made those plays at the end there and we win," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared Goff went 21-for-34 for 221 yards and two touchdowns while on the ground, the running back pair Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery put up 175 yards between them. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leaders the Cleveland Cavaliers suffered their first home loss of the season with a surprise 135-124 defeat to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's second loss of the season came afer a strong second half display from Atlanta with De'Andre Hunter scoring 26 points off the bench, Jalen Johnson adding 22 points and Trae Young contributing 20 with a career-high 22 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young put the game beyond the Cavs with a 39-foot three pointer to make it 129-122 with just under two minutes remaining, moments after he had turned the ball over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Johnson said Young's assists had been crucial to the victory, and that he deserved more credit for his role on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was really getting off the ball and finding everyone," Johnson said. "A lot of people don't necessarily talk about him, even though he's leading the league in assists – but they don't talk about him as the playmaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win moves the Hawks to 8-11 on the season, and Young said the team had shown what they were capable of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a really good team who have been playing well all year, and I feel we have been a little inconsistent but the times that we have played well, we've played really well," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 30 for Cleveland and Evan Mobley put up 22 points and 13 rebounds, but the Cavs missed out on a chance to become the first team to start with an 18-1 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets needed overtime to beat the 3-14 Philadelphia 76ers, with Alperen Şengün scoring 22 points and claiming 14 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Half of Şengün's points came in overtime, where the Rockets made sure of moving to 14-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, James Harden scored 43 points for the Los Angeles Clippers as they beat the struggling Washington Wizards 121-96.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden scored 23 of his points in the first quarter, and left the game late in the third quarter with the Wizards already condemned to their 13th straight defeat. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Barcelona and Uruguay striker Luis Suárez has signed a one-year contract extension with the Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and will line up under new coach Javier Mascherano next season, the team said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old striker has scored 25 goals in all competitions since joining the club before the start of this season including 20 in Miami's record-breaking regular season campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  After winning the Supporters' Shield for the best record in the regular season, with a new points tally record, Miami were eliminated from the playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then Argentina head coach Gerardo Martino has left the club with his compatriot and Suárez's former team-mate at Barca, Mascherano appointed on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy, very excited to continue for another year and to be able to enjoy being here with this fan base, which for us is like family," said Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel very, very connected with Suárez, and hopefully, next year, we can bring them even more joy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's president of football operations Raul Sanllehi said Suárez had shown he remains an elite level forward, but was also a key component in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Luis was not only our leading scorer this season, but also a leader for the group. His impact cannot be understated," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suárez announced in September he was retiring from international duty with the Uruguay national team after scoring 69 goals in 143 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward played in Europe for Ajax, Liverpool and Atlético Madrid and had a season in Brazil with Gremio before joining Miami. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy is reportedly set to be appointed as Leicester City's new manager, various British media outlets said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy recently left Manchester United after a short spell as interim manager and serving as assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester sacked Steve Cooper on Sunday after just 12 Premier League games in charge, with the Foxes 16th in the table and only one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Van Nistelrooy's three wins in four games as United's caretaker boss in the past month came against Leicester in the League Cup and Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old Dutchman has previous managerial experience from one year in charge of PSV Eindhoven from 2022 to 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky Sports reported that he could even be appointed in time to lead Leicester in their next game away at Brentford on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a glorious playing career, most notably at PSV, Man United and Real Madrid. (AFP)

    Kumara gives Sri Lanka edge against South Africa

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lahiru Kumara struck twice as Sri Lanka's bowlers had the better of a rain-hit opening day of the first Test against South Africa at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Africa were 80 for four when rain stopped play for the day shortly before lunch. Fast bowler Kumara took wickets in successive overs to put his team on top – and was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot in favour of the bowling team and they bowled well. The deliveries that got wickets were all pretty decent," said South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a skilled bowling line-up and obviously they have done their homework," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lankan bowling coach Darshana Gamage said pace was Kumara's biggest asset. With a history of hamstring injuries, he is now being used as a Test specialist.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this Test championship, we wanted to have all our bowlers fresh," said Gamage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our biggest challenge is to have quicks who will win us Test matches and I can say that we have the nucleus now to do the job away from home," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka's decision to bowl first on a well-grassed pitch paid off under a heavily overcast sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Namesakes Ajitha and Vishwa Fernando dismissed both South Africa's openers with the total on 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tristan Stubbs and South African captain Temba Bavuma defended doggedly, taking the total to 29 after 13 overs.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a flurry of scoring when Kumara came into the attack in the 14th over, with 17 runs added off his first over – four leg-byes, a no-ball and three boundaries by Stubbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the strongly-built Kumara found extra bounce with the first ball of his second over, having Stubbs caught at third slip for 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weather is expected to clear from Thursday and Prince said South Africa were in a reasonable position, referring to the first Test between Australia and India in Perth last weekend when two low first innings totals were followed by a strong Indian second-innings performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-Test series is crucial to both sides' hopes of reaching next year's World Test Championship final at Lord's, with Sri Lanka sitting third in the table and South Africa fifth. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé saw a penalty saved as Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 on Wednesday to inflict a third Uefa Champions League defeat in five matches on the holders.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored the goals in the second half as the Reds maintained their perfect record to return to the top of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah also fired wide from the spot, but it mattered little as Liverpool secured a 17th win in Arne Slot's first 19 games in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has already achieved what Jurgen Klopp could not as Liverpool boss by slaying the Spanish giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had a score to settle with Madrid, who were unbeaten in eight previous meetings between the sides, including Champions League finals against Klopp's men in 2018 and 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat sends Carlo Ancelotti's side tumbling down to 24th in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the first minute they just took control of the game," said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham, in what was a disappointing return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think they were more up for it than us, to be honest, which is really disappointing to say. It's a bad result against probably the best-performing team in Europe," he added. "It's no disgrace to come here and lose, but we are disappointed in how we performed."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top 24 progress to the knockout stage with the top eight advancing directly to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are well on course to do just that and the confidence coursing through a side also eight points clear at the top of the Premier League was in evidence throughout in front of a highly-charged Anfield crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hamstrung by a lengthy injury list and made the trip to England without Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao, Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young centre-back Raul Asencio has been pressed into action by those absences and he made a vital goal-line clearance on four minutes. (AFP)

<img alt="Man City's Erling Haaland (L) fights for the ball with Feyenoord's Bart Nieuwkoop. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780973_1_20241127074637.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City blew a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in a Champions League thriller on Tuesday and extend their winless run to six games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions did snap a five-game losing streak, but did little to boost confidence ahead of Sunday's trip to Premier League leaders Liverpool by conceding three times in the final 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola admitted his star-studded squad were "fragile" and lacking in confidence after the worst run of his managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two goals from Erling Haaland, either side of Ilkay Gundogan's deflected effort, looked set to restore some order for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defensive frailties that have been the root cause for a staggering collapse in recent weeks was exposed in the closing stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anis Hadj Moussa, Santiago Gimenez and David Hancko hit back to salvage a vital point for the Dutch giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We concede a lot of goals because we are not stable," said Guardiola. "We lost a lot of games lately – we are fragile, and of course we need a victory."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game [at 3-0] was good for the confidence, playing at a good level and the first time something happens we have problems," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  A draw leaves City with plenty of work to do to reach the knockout stages with trips to Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain to come in their next two Champions League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top eight progress directly to the last 16 with a place in the top 24 of the 36-team table enough to reach the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  City drop to 15th on eight points from five matches, just one point ahead of Feyenoord in 20th. (AFP)

<img alt="Inter Milan's Stefan de Vrij waves to fans after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780968_1_20241127072051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig meanwhile remain on no points after a fifth defeat in as many games in the Champions League, with even qualification for the play-offs looking tricky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal extended their revival with a ruthless 5-1 rout of Sporting Lisbon to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side ended a three-match winless run in all competitions by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 in the Premier League last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard netted late on to give Arsenal five away goals in a Champions League game for the first time since 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's third win in five Champions League matches this season lifted them into seventh place, with the top eight teams in the revamped tournament earning automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting's first defeat in Europe's elite club competition this season leaves them below Arsenal on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their dip, but this swaggering effort suggested they are finally back in the groove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta had challenged Arsenal to make a statement against Sporting and they responded in emphatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners' first away win in the Champions League in six attempts was a welcome tonic after a 1-0 loss at Inter Milan in their last European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's impressive performance was all the more notable as Sporting had crushed Manchester City 4-1 in their final Champions League game under Ruben Amorim, who has since taken charge of Manchester United. (AFP)

    Bayern edge PSG to dent Champions League hopes

<img alt="Bayern Munich players celebrate after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780966_1_20241127071610.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A first-half header from Min-jae Kim guided Bayern Munich to a 1-0 home win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, worsening the French side's hopes of progressing in the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre-back scored after an error from PSG goalkeeper Matvei Safonov, starting ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma, who spilled the ball into Kim's path.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean's effort was the only goal in the rematch of 2020's Champions League final, won by Bayern by the same scoreline, and all but extinguishes PSG's hopes of a top-eight finish and avoiding the playoff round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ousmane Dembele picked up a second yellow for an unnecessary challenge with half an hour remaining, with Bayern successfully shutting up shop as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just three games remaining, even making the knockouts is not a given for the French champions, who are in 26th spot – outside the playoff placings.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG host Manchester City in January along with facing tricky away trips to Red Bull Salzburg and Stuttgart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's top-eight hopes look rosier after the win, which extended their run of clean sheets to seven straight games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern now sit 11th and take on relative European minnows Shakhtar Donetsk, Feyenoord and Slovan Bratislava in their remaining games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides came into the game unbeaten and six points clear in their domestic leagues but in dire need of points in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern coach Vincent Kompany opted for the speed of Leroy Sane over the creativity of France winger Michael Olise up front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG boss Luis Enrique made five changes to his side but it was his decision to stick with goalkeeper Safonov, rather than Donnarumma, who had played all but one Champions League game this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enrique defended his call before the game, telling reporters "I make my choices based on what I see on the pitch and what's best for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision appeared to pay off early, with Safonov responsible for good saves from Jamal Musiala and Leroy Sane inside the opening 12 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kingsley Coman, the PSG academy product who scored the only goal in the 2020 final, almost broke the deadlock shortly afterwards, dribbling through five defenders and blasting just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After PSG had a few opportunities of their own, including Joao Neves' long-range effort whistling past the goalpost on 33 minutes, the Russian goalkeeper made a mistake which led directly to the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich swung in a corner on the 38-minute mark which Safonov spilled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim was on the spot to power an ascending header against Safonov's momentum and into the top left corner of the net, his first Champions League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern were happy to let the game come to them in the second-half but Dembele's second yellow – his first had come for dissent – took the steam out of PSG's hopes of a comeback. (AFP)

    Andrey Rublev hopes to swing another victory in HK

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis sensation Andrey Rublev says he is looking forward to playing in Hong Kong again, emphasising that having a strong mindset sets the stage for his entire tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World No. 8 player is eager to defend his title at the Hong Kong Tennis Open 2025, which will take place from December 29 to January 5 at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev said he is excited for the event, adding that the unwavering support of the SAR fans and the welcoming environment boosted his comfort and motivation last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great the atmosphere there last year. There was a lot of people who came from [the mainland] to watch me play and it was nice. It's a bit different compared to Europe audience because in general in Asia, they like to draw some posters," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They like to draw. Some put something on the face or to wear the flags or to wear some T-shirts with some signs. Last year, I remember there was a lot of people that had a flag with my photo and it was nice."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev exited the 2024 ATP Finals more than a week ago without securing a victory, having been defeated in his last match against Casper Ruud, but he said he is actively enhancing his physical abilities to boost his speed for the upcoming tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he opts to refrain from setting rigid goals to prevent burnout, and instead focuses on enjoying the sport he loves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're working much more in a bit in a different direction and I start to feel that I'm doing this better, so I just want to keep doing that, to play better at the net because, especially now, there is many matches that somehow can be one or two points different and this one or two points different [is] because I didn't play well at the net and then the other guy, when he went to the net and I tried to pass him he played really well and that was the difference in the most important time and the most important moment of the match," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things like that with the serve with the changing a bit of the rhythm, I start to hit better because I start to feel that I'm doing it better. We'll see just to keep doing them because in the end, it's not about preseason. It's a bit like a daily routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You need to do it a bit every day. It doesn't matter if you're in a tournament or not. That's it. It's something that we were doing the last couple of months and it's just now preseason and we have even more time to do it."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, DP World Tour Championship winner Rory McIlroy, and two-time major winner Xander Schuaffele were named Monday as 2024 PGA Tour Player of the Year award nominees.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Jack Nicklaus Award, named for the record 18-time major winner, and the Arnold Palmer Award for the PGA Rookie of the Year will be voted upon by PGA Tour members through December 4 with winners announced by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nominees for PGA Rookie of the Year include France's Matthieu Pavon and Americans Nick Dunlap, Jake Knapp and Max Greyserman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler and Schauffele are favorites in the top player race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scheffler won Paris Olympic gold and captured seven titles on the PGA Tour, including his second Masters title in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old American also won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship, the Heritage and Memorial tournaments, the Travelers Championship and the season-ending Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the season money leader and took the Byron Nelson Award for low scoring average at 68.645 strokes. He had 16 top-10 PGA finishes without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schauffele captured his first two major titles, winning the PGA Championship and the British Open, and the 31-year-old American was second in scoring average at 69.137. He had 15 top-10 efforts without missing a cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy won the Zurich Classic pairs event with Irishman Shane Lowry and his fourth Wells Fargo Championship on the PGA Tour and had 15 top-10s without a missed cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland almost captured his fifth major title and first since 2014 but settled for second at the US Open to Bryson DeChambeau.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the rookies, 20-year-old Dunlap was the surprise story. He won the American Express title as an amateur on a sponsor exemption in January, turned professional and then captured the Barracuda Championship, becoming the first player in tour history to win as a pro and amateur in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pavon, 32, won the Farmers Insurance Open and was third at Pebble Beach as well as fifth in the US Open. He was the only rookie to qualify for the season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knapp, 30, won his first PGA title at the Mexico Open while Greyserman, 29, was a three-time runner-up. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham produced a clinical away performance to beat resurgent Newcastle 2-0 on Monday, easing the pressure on beleaguered manager Julen Lopetegui.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek headed the visitors in front against the run of play at St James' Park and Aaron Wan-Bissaka grabbed a rare goal in the second half to double the Hammers' lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle were unable to capitalise on the chances they created, failing to build on the momentum created by recent wins against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result, only West Ham's second win on the road this season, lifts them to 15 points, just three behind 10th-placed Newcastle, who missed out on the chance to move into the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made the early running and in-form forward Alexander Isak had the ball in the net in the fifth minute after a delicate dink over Lukasz Fabianski, only for it to be ruled out for offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham, expected to face a tough test on Newcastle's home turf, showed little adventure in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their first real foray up the pitch resulted in a corner and the unmarked Soucek powered home a header from close range in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle enjoyed the bulk of the possession as a lively first half unfolded but West Ham were robust in defence and threatened when they went forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon had a glorious chance to level after a poor clearance from Jean-Clair Todibo but fired straight at Fabianski.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes later Isak chested down a superb cross from Bruno Guimarães but steered narrowly wide on the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's Newcastle were again on the front foot at the start of the second half but it was West Ham who doubled their lead through Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United man scored his first goal for West Ham and just his third career goal after picking up Jarrod Bowen's pass and firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe brought on Jacob Murphy and Callum Wilson in a bid to turn the tide but Newcastle failed to build up a head of steam against their determined opponents, who saw out the game with relative ease. (AFP)

    Cadillac to join Formula 1 grid in 2026

<img alt='F1 had reached an "agreement in principle" with Cadillac owner General Motors. File photo: AFP' src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780809_1_20241126073224.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American car manufacturer Cadillac will become the eleventh team on the Formula One grid in 2026, after the sport's owners announced Monday they had given their backing to the plan.
 <br>
  <br>
  Formula 1 said it had reached "an agreement in principle" with General Motors (GM), which owns Cadillac, to support bringing a team into the paddock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Formula 1 has maintained a dialogue with General Motors, and its partners at TWG Global, regarding the viability of an entry following the commercial assessment and decision made by Formula 1 in January 2024," Formula One said in its statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the course of this year, they have achieved operational milestones and made clear their commitment to brand the eleventh team GM/Cadillac, and that GM will enter as an engine supplier at a later time," Formula One said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cars are expected to be powered by Ferrari before it develops its own engines.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move comes after Formula 1 rejected the bid which was headed up by Andretti – owned by Michael Andretti, son of 1978 world champion Mario Andretti – earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nearly a fortnight ago, GM announced it had registered with the FIA to become a Formula One engine manufacturer from 2028, offering support to Andretti's bid to join the F1 grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Andretti name has since been dropped from the proposal with Michael no longer involved, although Mario is understood to be taking on an ambassadorial role.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an honour for General Motors and Cadillac to join the world's premier racing series, and we're committed to competing with passion and integrity to elevate the sport for race fans around the world," said GM president Mark Reuss.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US has become an increasingly important stop on the F1 tour. This announcement comes less than 48 hours after the Las Vegas Grand Prix which, after Miami and Austin, is the third US race on the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Netflix series 'Drive to Survive' has also boosted the sport's profile in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, who had been in favour of the original Andretti bid, said he was "fully supportive" of the arrival of the GM/Cadillac team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All parties, including the FIA, will continue to work together to ensure the process progresses smoothly," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stefano Domenicali, the president and CEO of Formula 1, described the news as "an important and positive demonstration of the evolution of our sport".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to seeing the progress and growth of this entry, certain of the full collaboration and support of all the parties involved," he said. (AFP)

    Ronaldo leads Al Nassr to brink of AFC quarter-finals

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice for Al Nassr as they continued to thrive in the AFC Champions League Elite, with the Saudi champions defeating Al Gharafa 3-1 in Qatar on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old's contributions moved Al Nassr nearer to the last eight, needing just two points from their final three group games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only Al Shorta on two points, with four games to play, can deny Ronaldo's side a place in the next round, after Persepolis drew 1-1 at Al Rayyan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr captain Ronaldo had looked destined to endure a hugely frustrating game following a series of missed opportunities in the first half at Al Bayt Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Portugal star finally opened the scoring little more than 50 seconds into the second half, when he headed home Sultan Al Ghannam's cross from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr then doubled their advantage through Angelo Gabriel, a summer signing from Chelsea, on 58 minutes, before the Brazilian turned provider six minutes later to tee up Ronaldo for his second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal took the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus forward to four goals in this season's rebranded competition before he was replaced on 74 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Gharafa did pull one back through Joselu, a former team-mate of Ronaldo at Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet their hopes of an unlikely late rally disappeared when Seydou Sano was sent off six minutes from the end of normal time for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win ensures Al Nassr remain unbeaten through five matches in the Western side of the draw, and move second in the 12-team table. (AFP)

    Australia's most decorated Olympian McKeon retires

<img alt="McKeon on the podium after the final of the women's 50m freestyle at Tokyo 2020. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780806_1_20241126070625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Emma McKeon, Australia's most decorated Olympian and an eight-time world-record holder, retired from the sport on Monday aged 30.
 <br>
  <br>
  McKeon won 14 Olympic medals, six of them gold, over the Rio, Tokyo and Paris Games this summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today I am officially retiring from competitive swimming," she said on Instagram, along with a collage of clips showcasing her many career highlights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Leading into Paris I knew it would be my last Olympics and the months since have given me time to reflect on my journey and think about what I wanted my future to look like in swimming," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was at the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021 that McKeon really made her name, winning an unsurpassed seven medals to join the all-time swimming greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her four gold and three bronze bettered the six won by East German Kristin Otto in 1988 and American Natalie Coughlin in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also matched the record for most decorated woman athlete at a single Games, tied with Russian gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya in 1952.
  <br>
  <br>
  A versatile and tenacious freestyle and butterfly racer, her career looked in jeopardy after failing to qualify for the London 2012 Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, she went on to become her country's most honoured Olympian -- a field with plenty of competition given Australia's swimming prowess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am proud of myself for giving my swimming career absolutely everything, both physically and mentally," she said on Monday. "I wanted to see what I was capable of – and I did."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Wollongong in New South Wales, McKeon, whose excellence was matched by her humility, had heritage in the pool with her father Ron swimming at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKeon's mother Susie swam at the 1982 Commonwealth Games while her brother David competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, with Emma and David becoming the first brother and sister to swim for Australia at the same Games in 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She was and will continue to be a great role model for younger athletes," said Australian swim team head coach Rohan Taylor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She always carried herself with dignity and while we all saw her grace the public can not truly appreciate how tough she is," she added. (AFP)

    Former Irish rugby international Brendan Mullin jailed

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Ireland rugby international Brendan Mullin was on Monday sentenced to three years in prison, after being found guilty of stealing more than 500,000 euros (nearly US$525 million) from a bank.
 <br>
  <br>
  A jury in Dublin earlier this month found Mullin, 61, guilty of 12 out of 14 charges, which ranged from theft, deception and furnishing false information to the bank authorising invoice payments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offences took place between 2011 and 2013 when he was chief executive of Bank of Ireland Private Bank in the Irish capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mullin won 55 caps for Ireland between 1984 and 1995, scoring 17 tries, and also played at three World Cups in 1987, 1991 and 1995.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Martin Nolan said Mullin offered no motive for his actions but could only infer that he was "somewhat desperate for funds and embarked on this endeavour to obtain money", national broadcaster RTE reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  In sentencing, he said he took into account that the bank was repaid in full and not at a loss, and that Mullin had shown remorse. But he said a custodial sentence was inevitable. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Sports Institute cycling head coach Hervé Dagorne on Monday hailed as a success Sunday's cross-border road race, an event that was largely seen as the first major test ahead of the 15th National Games to be held next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said the organisation of the race, which featured dozens of cyclists traversing a 230-kilometre route that included a crossing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, was behind the positive result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was very impressed with how smooth it all turned out," Dagorne said. "This was the first time we could hold such a race passing through a bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's one of the longest bridges in the world, so for us, we were able to gain more knowledge on how we can manage the actual race come next year. We were all very excited, and interested to see what we can achieve in the National Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne also highlighted the obstacles that came with organising the large scale sporting event, and noted what needs to be done ahead of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The matter of immigration is an important aspect when it comes to organisation [of the race]." he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must also determine how wind and slope can affect athletes – as such factors can be difficult to predict while passing a bridge compared to when on a car or bus."
  <br>
  <br>
  The race is set to be the first national sports event that connects Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.

    Road cycling trial took less time than anticipated

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Games Coordination Office on Monday said the overall time taken for a cross-border cycling race on Sunday was shorter than expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event was held as a test race for the National Games that will be staged in the Greater Bay Area next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told an RTHK radio programme that the race went very smoothly, and cyclists completed the event safely.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were also no special incidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The cyclists rode slightly faster than we thought. At first, we expected them to take around an hour and 30 minutes to complete the Hong Kong section of the race. But it turned out they completed the leg in an hour and 22 minutes," Yeung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That meant that for the whole event, whether heading to Hong Kong Disneyland after passing the bridge as well as heading back to the mainland, it was faster than we anticipated."
  <br>
  <br>
  He said cyclists and their supporting crews told the office after the event that the race distance of 230km posed a challenge for them, and they also struggled with strong winds on the bridge, as well as light rain in Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said the cyclists managed to go faster once they had adapted to the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the race route is suitable for the National Games, but did not rule out the possibility of making adjustments.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah fired Liverpool eight points clear at the top of the Premier League as the leaders survived a scare from lowly Southampton, thanks to the Egypt star's second half double in a 3-2 away win on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had squandered the lead given to them by Dominik Szoboszlai's second goal this season as Adam Armstrong levelled before the break at St Mary's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's 10th win in 12 league games ensured they capitalised on City's dismal 4-0 defeat against Tottenham 24 hours earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first Premier League crown since 2020, the Reds have a golden opportunity to throttle City's hopes of a fifth successive title when Pep Guardiola's team visit Anfield on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have lost five in a row in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully, we keep going in that direction," Salah said. "We have a game against them so hopefully, we win it and go 11 points clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Man City is Man City", he added. "They have a bad time now, but they have great players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah now has 12 goals in all competitions this term, including six in his last five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were very important, especially after being down 2-1. It's the most important thing to have won the game," he said. "Each game is different. They had a game plan and played very well – we managed to come back and win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mateus Fernandes put bottom of the table Southampton ahead after the interval before Salah sparred Liverpool's blushes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah coolly netted the equaliser and then held his nerve to stroke home the late penalty that gave him 12 goals in all competitions this season and six in his last five league appearances.

  <br>
  Thanks to Salah's late heroics, Liverpool have left second placed Manchester City trailing in their wake after the champions' dismal 4-0 defeat against Tottenham on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has made a remarkable start to his time in charge of the Reds, winning 16 of his first 18 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Feyenoord manager's deft touch has established Liverpool as favourites for a first Premier League title since 2020 in his maiden season at Anfield after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were below their best against Southampton but the gritty victory was the ideal start to a pivotal period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning champion Kansas City edged Carolina and Detroit ripped Indianapolis on Sunday to reach an NFL-best 10-1 while Dallas shocked arch-rival Washington to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns and Spencer Shrader kicked a 31-yard field goal on the final play to lift Kansas City over the host Panthers 30-27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chuba Hubbard's 1-yard touchdown run and a 2-point conversion run had put Carolina level with just under two minutes remaining, setting the stage for the Chiefs' seven-play, 57-yard march to set up the winning kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the Chiefs with a 10th triumph to keep a conference lead was Detroit, with Jahmyr Gibbs rushing for 90 yards and two touchdowns and David Montgomery running for another score in the Lions' 24-6 triumph at Indianapolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  A wild finish with 38 points in the last 5:16 marked the Dallas Cowboys' 34-26 victory at Washington, where the Commanders appeared to have lost, then made an amazing comeback only to fall in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooper Rush's second touchdown pass, a 22-yarder to Luke Schoonmaker with five minutes remaining, gave Dallas a 20-9 edge, but Jayden Daniels threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz and ran for a 2-point conversion to pull Washington within 20-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  KaVontae Turpin answered with a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown on the ensuing play, but again the Commanders responded as Austin Seibert kicked a 51-yard field goal and Daniels connected with Terry McLaurin on an 86-yard touchdown pass with 21 seconds remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seibert, however, shockingly missed the conversion kick to keep Dallas ahead 27-26 and the Cowboys added a Juanyeh Thomas 43-yard kickoff return touchdown on the next play to seal victory. (AFP)

    Sinner leads Italy to second straight Davis Cup title

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner completed his sensational year by leading Italy to a successful defence of the Davis Cup with victory over the Netherlands in the final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number one eased to a 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 triumph against Tallon Griekspoor for the winning point after Matteo Berrettini had put the defending champions ahead with a convincing 6-4, 6-2 win against Botic van de Zandschulp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner ends 2024 with titles at the Australian Open, US Open and the ATP Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The whole team is amazing, we tried to defend our title and we have done it, so we're extremely happy – there's a lot of work behind it," said Sinner as Italy won the Davis Cup for a third time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy became the first team to defend the title since the Czech Republic in 2013, and the fifth nation to win it along with the Billie Jean King Cup in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strong Italian support, along with an orange wall of Dutch fans, made for a fine atmosphere at the Martin Carpena arena, with the Netherlands in the final for the first time in 104 years of trying.
  <br>
  <br>
  However defeating Sinner this year has been nigh on impossible for most players, let alone with the pressure of carrying a nation's hopes on their shoulders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor, ranked 40th, has now lost all six meetings with Sinner but battled remarkably well, forcing Sinner to save two early break points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serving brilliantly, Griekspoor twice held to love and hit two aces in the 12th game to force a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner secured an early mini-break and another for a 5-2 lead, firing down his 12th ace to take the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian brought up and converted his first break point of the match to take a 2-1 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor produced a backhand winner to drag his way back on serve but undid his good work with a double fault that allowed Sinner to break again for a 3-2 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was up for the Dutch and Sinner broke again in the seventh game before sealing his triumph with his fourth match point with a scorching serve Griekspoor could not return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had no other option than playing a high level match – if you want to have a chance against Jannik in this kind of form, this kind of shape, this kind of confidence," said Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jannik is very tough to beat, especially, with the season he had, he deserves all of it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands captain Paul Haarhuis was part of the last Dutch team to reach the semi-finals 22 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a love relationship with second place, I have a hate relationship with second place," said Haarhuis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though I'm unbelivably proud of the guys, for now it feels (terrible)."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini edged the first set against Van de Zandschulp but hit his peak in the second and left the Dutchman no chance, winning in 76 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 35, who came to support Italy as they ended a 47-year wait for the trophy in 2023 as he missed out with an ankle injury, was crucial in their Davis Cup defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old paired up with Sinner to help Italy triumph in a doubles decider against Argentina in the last eight, before winning his semi-final singles rubber against Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels unbelievable, it feels really great to be on court – if you win it's better, but being able to be healthy, here and enjoying this kind of atmosphere is the most important thing for me, because I missed that," said Berrettini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely feel that my level never really left. When you're struggling physically and mentally it's not easy to play your best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Van de Zandschulp, ranked 80th, became the last player to defeat Rafael Nadal before the Spanish superstar headed into retirement earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  However he was blown away by Berrettini, who moved ahead in the ninth game of the first set. The Italian opened up three break points and took the first to claim a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second set Berrettini, who was Wimbledon runner-up in 2021, broke in the third game and again in the seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian produced 10 forehand winners and 16 aces on his way to victory, teeing up Sinner to finish the tie. (AFP)

    Man Utd held by Ipswich in Amorim's first match

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim was given a stark illustration of the size of his task at Manchester United after his uninspiring team were held 1-1 by struggling Ipswich in his first match in charge on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former Sporting Lisbon boss – the latest man tasked with restoring the club to the top of English football – spoke before kick-off about the need to be "patient".
  <br>
  <br>
  But he had barely settled in his seat at a blustery Portman Road before Marcus Rashford turned in Amad Diallo's inviting cross, stunning the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich, who started the day in the relegation zone, battled back, earning the equaliser they deserved through Omari Hutchinson just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither side could find a winner in the second period despite chances at both ends, with the result leaving both managers unsatisfied.
  <br>
  <br>
  United are a lowly 12th in the Premier League, six points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, while Ipswich are still in the drop zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who cut an animated figure on the touchline, said his players were guilty of over-thinking during the game against Kieran McKenna's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think my players were thinking too much," he told Sky Sports. "We lost some balls without pressure. But they really, really tried and they want this."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This week I spoke more to the media than I did in four years at Sporting," he added. "I just want to work with my players – nothing more." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 American golfer Patrick Reed has won the Hong Kong Open in style, shooting a 22-under overall to clinch the title on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The overnight leader entered the final day with a three-shot lead, after notching a 59, an 18-hole record at the historic Fanling course.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA Tour professional ended up edging defending champion, Ben Campbell from New Zealand by the same margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was Reed's fifth time playing in Hong Kong, and he told reporters that he was glad to have finally triumphed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome playing this golf course, to come out and learn from the mistakes from the past on this place, and to go out and really feel like I was in command and control around a golf course," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was able to hit quality golf shots after quality golf shots, which has always been a tough thing around here for me in the past."
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho finished six shots behind Reed, good for a tied-sixth overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he didn't have the best of starts on the final day, but he felt he bounced back well and there were still plenty of positive takeaways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was just really focused out there and I was able to let myself play golf. You know, towards the start of it, I wasn't too comfortable to swing, so I was aiming away, aiming at the middle of the greens," the Hong Kong, China golfer said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But once I felt like I'd gone in the groove of it, I was able to aim at flags a bit more and get a bit more aggressive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of spectators were on hand for the tournament at the Fanling Golf Course, with many families bringing their children for a nice day out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among them was Queenie, a mother of two who managed to share a photo moment with Kho.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m so excited, I got an autograph, a photograph with him. He’s so nice, very friendly,” she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament was also a test event for next year’s National Games, when golf will be one of eight sports Hong Kong will be hosting while other events take place in Macau and Guangdong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Golf Club captain Andy Kwok said both local and mainland officials have been at the site in the past few days to gauge the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They assess various aspects of the tournament. My feeling is I think they are quite happy with what the club and the organisers have put forward in this tournament," Kwok told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully we can carry this momentum forward to the National Games next year and put together a very good show for both Hong Kong and spectators from afar."

    Smooth riding for cyclists in cross-border test race

<img alt="Some travellers were left frustrated by the closure of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780609_2_20241124141606.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A cross-border road cycling race which doubled as a test event for the National Games held in the Greater Bay Area next year went ahead smoothly on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of 67 cyclists set off from Zhuhai at 9am for the men's individual 230-kilometres event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The peloton arrived in Hong Kong about 90 minutes later via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The cyclists continued east along the North Lantau Highway, and headed back to the mainland after passing Hong Kong Disneyland in Sunny Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offered authorities a chance to gauge disruption to traffic. Lanes in both directions on the cross-border bridge were closed in staggered intervals to allow the cyclists to pass through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traffic fully resumed shortly after 12:30pm.
  <br>
  <br>
  But some Hong Kong travellers arriving the border checkpoint were unaware of the temporary arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know the roads were closed today. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come. I plan to go home, and return this afternoon," Mr Fong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but there wasn't much information available. I'm really frustrated because I have no idea how to get to Zhuhai," another man bemoaned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they should definitely issue more information or reminders on the MTR. There should be announcements at every station. If I'd known in advance, I could have made alternative plans," said another traveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  The unique nature of the race drew a lot of interest from locals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I saw the news yesterday, so I wanted to come here and take pictures. I used to take part in road cycling races ... I hope Zhuhai will continue to develop this sport and hold similar events every year,” a Zhuhai resident said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another man said he came all the way from Zhongshan to support his former teammates who participated in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I arrived in Zhuhai two days ago because my former teammates also arrived early to acclimatise to the environment. I came here to cycle with them. It really brought back memories of us training together," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung said his colleagues would review the arrangements with their mainland and Macau counterparts, and seek further improvements.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said as a result of the road closures, travellers to and from the airport spent 20 to 25 minutes longer on average this morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was already less than what we forecast at the beginning. So I think overall, the test event has been carried out very smoothly,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted three cyclists had to abandon the Hong Kong section of the race, although there were no accidents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office, revealed the General Administration of Sport of China has not decided how many cyclists can sign up for the actual race next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City collapsed to their fifth straight defeat on Saturday, hammered 4-0 by Tottenham in another huge blow to their Premier League title hopes as Arsenal got their challenge back on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rout at the Etihad ends City's 52-game unbeaten home run and leaves manager Pep Guardiola scrambling for answers just two days after he signed a contract extension with the club he has guided to four consecutive league titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the start of the match, City staged a spectacular tribute to the injured Rodri, who showcased the Ballon d'Or trophy he won last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the feel-good spirit did not last long as Spurs showed the home team how much they are missing the Spain midfielder, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored twice in the opening 20 minutes and Pedro Porro extended Tottenham's lead early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs completed their crushing win in stoppage time when Timo Werner raced down the left, squaring for Brennan Johnson to slide home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we have to live it and break it winning the next games, especially the next one. Now we see things in one way, maybe in a few weeks we see it differently."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added: "The fire is when you win a lot of games, which is better than when you are losing, but we accept this. We have to move forward and break it and try."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who have lost their past three Premier League matches and their last five in all competitions, remain five points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand against Southampton on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time defending Premier League champions travel to Anfield next weekend, where defeat would leave their title hopes in tatters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are now in sixth spot, said he was proud of his side, admitting said it was possible to become "spooked" against City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They test you in every way - mentally, physically, tactically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal earlier crushed Nottingham Forest 3-0 to pull level on 22 points with third-placed Chelsea, who saw off Leicester in the early kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's Gunners were expected to be contenders for City's crown after finishing second in each of the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they had failed to win in their previous four league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard's return from a long injury lay-off is a major boost for Arsenal and he teed up Bukayo Saka to blast home the opener on 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka turned provider for another special strike, this time by Thomas Partey early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenager Ethan Nwaneri then came off the bench to score his first Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking about Odegaard, who returned to action at Inter Milan earlier this month, Arteta said: "It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea remain ahead of Arsenal on goals scored after a 2-1 win on manager Enzo Maresca's return to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson scored the opener but Chelsea struggled to make their dominance count until Enzo Fernandez headed home, before a late consolation goal from the penalty spot for Jordan Ayew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa are now winless in six games in all competition and had to twice come from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's incredible start under 31-year-old boss Fabian Hurzeler continued with a 2-1 win at Bournemouth to climb to fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are out of the bottom three thanks to a stunning 4-1 win at Fulham, with Matheus Cunha scoring twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton failed to take advantage of an early red card for Brentford's Christian Norgaard in a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.

<img alt="South Africa's Aphelele Fassi crashes over for the Springboks' fifth try against Wales. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780579_1_20241124073302.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World champions South Africa hammered Wales 45-12 in Cardiff on Saturday to condemn Warren Gatland's team to a 12th consecutive Test defeat and a winless calendar year for the first time since 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Springboks were dominant throughout at the Principality Stadium, scoring seven tries to two in a relentless display that matched attacking accuracy with defensive brutality and set-piece mastery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result meant the Boks, who wrapped up the Rugby Championship title this year, finish their season with 11 victories from 13 Tests, having used a whopping 52 players and scoring 57 tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first two games we weren't happy, there was so much we could have done better," Springbok captain Siya Kolisi told TNT Sports of opening November victories over Scotland and England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Results are important but it's how you do things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the first time South Africa have won all their matches on their November tour since 2013 and means they will see in 2025 as World Rugby's number one ranked country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boks' sole losses were one-point defeats by Argentina and Ireland, a record of which Gatland and his backroom staff could only dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales' last victory came over pool opponents Georgia in October 2023 at the Rugby World Cup, with Gatland having to blood a raft of inexperienced players after a host of seniors hung up their boots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-match entertainment included choirs singing "Yma O Hyd", the Dafydd Iwan folk song that has become the go-to song for Welsh football's "Red Wall" support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, it translates into English as "Still Here", albeit in reference to Wales and the Welsh language and not Gatland per se.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Welsh Rugby Union has its AGM on Sunday where discussions are expected on the New Zealander's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You don't make a decision straight after a game," said Gatland. "Let's just see what happens over the next few days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales captain Dewi Lake told TNT Sports his side had showed "a lot of heart and character".
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are double world champions, that's not for no reason," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to keep the faith, the second we lose our faith in ourselves then it's pointless us stepping on the field, we can definitely see a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scene was set within the opening eight frantic minutes in the Welsh capital as the visiting lock pair of Franco Mostert and Eben Etzebeth each crossed for a try after deft attacking lead-up play by Kurt-Lee Arendse on both occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kolisi was held up over the line by James Botham, but the Boks fired back to the Welsh line and Arendse got his just rewards for his strong start, stepping inside Blair Murray's attempted tackle with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Hendrikse converted two of the three tries to make it 19-0 after the opening quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray did well to hold up Aphelele Fassi over the line and Kolisi had a try disallowed, but the toll on Wales was beginning to show.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long could their defence hold out? Not long as the Boks promptly pushed Wales off their own ball at scrum time and flanker Elrigh Louw barged over for the visitors' fourth five-pointer after a quick tap penalty by Jasper Wiese.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rare Welsh incursion into the opposition half saw the home side, wearing white to avoid a colour-blindness clash with the green of South Africa, go for an attacking line-out, but the Boks repelled two 12-man mauls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was eventually moved wide and Welsh winger Rio Dyer showed a brilliant flash of raw pace to scorch the defence for a fine individual try. Sam Costelow missed the conversion to leave the score 26-5 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fassi crossed for South Africa's fifth try after the outstanding Arendse split the Welsh line early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A raft of replacements for both sides gave Wales a degree of respite, but it was not long before Gerhard Steenkamp was driven over from short range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things turned scrappy and the 67,236-strong crowd turned attention away from the action and Welsh hymns to foot-stomping Mexican waves, always a sure sign the game was well and over as a contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrikse crossed for the Boks' seventh try and converted for a personal game tally of 15 points before a Botham consolation try converted by Ben Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other Test action, New Zealand saw off Italy 29-11 in their final match of the year as Sam Cane was given a winning farewell to international rugby in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Roigard, Will Jordan, Mark Tele'a and Beauden Barrett scored the tries as the All Blacks beat Italy for the 18th consecutive time, with fly-half Barrett kicking the rest visitors' points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cane closed out his Test career with 104 caps, and T-J Perenara also played his final All Blacks match as a second half substitute. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was an historic day for American Patrick Reed at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling on Saturday, as he shot a rare round of 59 to catapult himself into a three-stroke lead at the end of day three.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 2018 winner at Augusta carded 11 birdies in his sizzling 11-under-par third round to go 18-under overall on the prestigious Asian Tour event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old's milestone is the lowest score ever in the tournament and overtakes a 60 scored by Britain's Ian Poulter in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had probably one of my worst warm-ups ever," Reed, 34, who is among a number of big-name players to have jumped ship to the Saudi-backed Liv Golf circuit, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked at my caddie and he said, 'Hey, a warm-up's a warm-up. Let's go out and just play golf. Some of your best rounds have come from a poor warm-up.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  The American started with a blistering five birdies in a row and rattled off four more on the trot to finish with a flurry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I honestly felt it could have been lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going into the final round in Fanling, Reed holds a three-shot lead over India's Rashid Khan and Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand as he chases a first win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand is a further shot back at 14-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong golfing sensation Taichi Kho shot a four-under-par 66 for round three to go 12-under overall, as the tournament gears up for its final round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho, along with six other players, ended the afternoon strong to hold on to a tie for sixth place – after a dominant display that saw him grouped with Japan's Kazuki Higa and Kevin Yuan of Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting off with a birdie was great," Kho told reporters. "I capitalised on a good second shot on the sixth [hole], and got away with a good break on thirteenth being behind a tree – but I had a big gap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So being able to hit it on and two from there, and two putting from birdie, definitely helped boost my round quite a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the 24-year-old bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open crown, he also noted the challenges he overcame throughout the afternoon under rainier conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A bit of fortune there," Kho said. "There were times where I found myself in the trees, but I managed to find an opening without much concern, which gave me the focus I needed to hit a good shot."
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the 63rd edition of the Hong Kong Open. (AFP/RTHK)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown drains a three-pointer on his way to top-scoring for the Boston Celtics. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780523_1_20241123151736.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown top-scored with 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics struggled to a 108-96 win at Washington in the NBA Cup on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics moved to 13-8 on the season but still have some work to do in the NBA Cup, where they are in second place at 2-1 in Eastern Conference Group C behind the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their celebratory trip to the White House on Thursday, the Celtics trailed by two at half-time, having been 11 points behind at one stage, and it wasn't until late in the fourth quarter that they were able to pull away from the Wizards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown delivered down the stretch, his superb turnaround jumper giving Boston a 99-92 lead and ending Washington's resistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a vintage Celtics performance though.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum, who scored 16 points, was 0-for-10 from three-point range and Boston shot 42.4 percent from the floor and 23.9 percent from three-point range, equalling their lowest scoring output of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla picked up a technical foul in the second half for remonstrating with the referee but said his emotions had an impact on the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It changed the energy in the arena. Did you feel that? It wasn't really about energising the guys, it was more about manipulating the environment. It was just what the environment needed at the time," said Mazzulla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, without the injured Luka Doncic, survived a strong comeback from the Denver Nuggets to emerge with a 123-120 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naji Marshall top-scored for the Mavs, off the bench, with 26 points, while PJ Washington put up 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic had a triple-double, top-scoring for Denver with 33 points along with 17 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas had a 24-point lead early in the third but Denver battled back and DeAndre Jordan's alley oop dunk shot made it a two-point game with 8:47 left in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Gafford's two-point shot levelled the game 108-108 with 5:13 remaining and it was nip and tuck all the way down the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Denver down a point and just four seconds left on the clock, Jamal Murray tried to hit the rim with his second free throw but inadvertently found the basket and two free throws from Washington sealed the win for Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all stepped up at the right time and we gutted out this win," said Mavs point guard Kyrie Irving, who said the team had shown the right attitude without Doncic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is next-man-up mentality and we've got to do our best to find that rhythm. Consistently feed each other that confidence, especially in tough environments like this. We had to will ourselves to this win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philadelphia 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 113-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared McCain scored 30 points and Tyrese Maxey 26 as the 76ers coped without the injured Joel Embiid and Paul George.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Johnson top-scored for the Nets with 37 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 30 points for the Golden State Warriors as they won 112-108 at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of free throws from Draymond Green saw the Warriors over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State's win moves them to 12-3 in the regular season and put them into the quarter-finals of the NBA Cup as they sit on a 3-0 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo produced his second triple-double in four games putting up 37 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Indiana Pacers 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard helped out with 24 points and 12 assists as the Bucks claimed their third straight win and went 2-0 in the NBA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary Trent Jr, off the bench, added 18 points for Milwaukee with his 6-of-10 three-point shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's playing with confidence, walks with confidence, works hard," Antetokounmpo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are the shots he makes in practice and we knew that sooner or later he would make them in games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am happy for him and need him to keep playing with confidence." (AFP)

    'Two years suitable to comply with new sports rules'
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780509_1_20241123114216.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok said that a two-year time frame is suitable for sports bodies to comply with new standards, adding that the National Sports Associations responded positively to the review report and governance code.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China had earlier reviewed the operations and governance of 77 member associations across six key areas - board governance, integrity management, selection of athletes, management of coaches and umpires, administration of membership, and general administration - totalling 243 governance items.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, Fok, who is also vice-president of SF&OC, noted that nearly 60 percent of these items have been fully or partially implemented.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that when it comes to selecting athletes, the criteria must be fair, just and open.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think past performance or potential should account for the vast majority of the selection process for all athletes. The responsibility of the National Sports Associations is to write down clear requirements. For each competition, what goals do I hope to achieve and what athletes do I hope to select? Performance may account for 60 percent, and there may be other indicators that account for the rest of the percentage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important principle is that the athlete's performance cannot be buried and cannot be prevented by other factors or institutional factors from being able to perform to the best of their abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said that the code of governance recommends that sports bodies implement a maximum tenure and length of term of office an individual may serve on the Board of Directors, adding that the age should not exceed 70 or 75 years old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each sports association faces different situations. Their initial establishment or stage of development and the level of talent participation in their industry or sports field are different. If there's a hard-and-fast age set, it may not necessarily be the best for the development of the sport so it's important to leave room for flexibility," he said.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 France eased to a 37-23 victory over an ill-disciplined Argentina at a bitterly cold Paris in their final game of the November internationals on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus claimed four tries including a superb solo effort from in-form winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey, following on from victories over Japan and New Zealand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three from three during the series makes us happy, it was the objective," Bielle-Biarrey told TF1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan was a little warm-up, then against the All Blacks we fought until the end. We end with three wins and I feel we improved game on game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Pumas had two players shown yellow cards in the first half, captain Julian Montoya and Juan Martin Gonzalez, which led to the hosts leading 30-9 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't start the way we wanted, our discipline wasn't good," Montoya told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What made me proud was we went again until the 80th minute, there's things to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  France coach Fabien Galthie made four changes from last Saturday's nerve-wracking one-point win over New Zealand as Charles Ollivon came in for the dropped Gregory Alldritt at No 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina boss Felipe Contepomi switched his scrum-half giving Gonzalo Garcia a start instead of Gonzalo Bertranou after last Friday's loss to Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the All Blacks, Les Bleus lost prop Tevita Tatafu to an early injury and loose-head Jean-Baptiste Gros suffered a similar fate after four minutes on Friday with a leg problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gros's injury was caused by Montoya's dangerous clean at a ruck and the hooker was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie's side made the extra man count to open the scoring as Antoine Dupont fed lock Thibaud Flament to crash over from short range after a powerful rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Ramos slotted the easy conversion to make it 7-0 after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the half hour mark the hosts lead 13-9 as Ramos traded penalty goals with Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz.
  <br>
  <br>
  France stretched their advantage to 20-9 as winger Gabin Villiere dived over following some dominant forward carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos added the conversion to overtake Dimitri Yachvili in third place on France's scoring charts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things worsened for Contepomi's outfit as they conceded a penalty try with four minutes of the first half to play and had a second player sent to the bin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flanker Gonzalez was shown a yellow card for palming a loose ball into touch after Dupont and Ramos showed their class with delicate chip kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France went into the break 30-9 ahead as Ramos slotted his third penalty of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the interval Galthie brought 20-year-old back-rower Marko Gazzotti on for his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flanker's main intervention was to scramble onto a loose ball three metres from his own line before Les Bleus cleared with Argentina working their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 24 minutes to play they were rewarded as prop Thomas Gallo benefitted from a rolling maul and Albornoz brought the score to 30-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas' comeback hopes were shortlived as Bielle-Biarrey scored his fourth try in three games, showing lightning speed to gather his own grubber kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos converted to make it 37-16 leaving the south Americans, fourth at last year's World Cup, with a mountain to climb in the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deficit was cut once again as Perpignan hooker Ignacio Ruiz, one of 10 French-based players in Argentina's matchday squad, barrelled over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz took the score to 37-23 with his two-pointer with nine minutes to play but it wasn't enough to claim a first win over France in Paris since 2014. (AFP)

    Vegas disaster for Verstappen as team bring wrong wing

<img alt="Senior adviser Helmut Marko says Red Bull are losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight because of the blunder. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780438_1_20241122193419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen's hopes of clinching a fourth consecutive drivers' world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend took a dent on Friday when Red Bull revealed they had brought the wrong rear wing.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Auto Motor und Sport, the team's senior advisor Helmut Marko said Red Bull were losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight, the Las Vegas Boulevard leading to Caesars Palace, after a packing blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have another rear wing, a smaller rear wing, as we see on our competitors," said Marko. "It would be more helpful, for sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it was too late for the team to arrange for a more appropriate trimmed rear wing to be flown out to Las Vegas before the race on Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen leads McLaren's Lando Norris by 62 points with three races remaining and simply needs to finish ahead of him in Las Vegas to become the sixth man to win four world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, however, struggled in second practice on Thursday night, finishing 17th in slippery conditions on the cold, dry and dusty circuit around the streets of 'Sin City' where the three-time champion won last year's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen tried to make light of the team's error, in packing the wrong rear wing, and blamed his struggle on the slippery conditions and difficulty with tyre temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The issue for us is definitely tyre-related as we have no grip and it feels like driving on ice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We struggled to make the tyres work, especially over one lap and we were quite far off with the pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team-mate Sergio Perez was 19th in the session topped by Mercedes' seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of Norris of McLaren, who said on Wednesday it is "probably too late" to stop Verstappen from taking the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were flashes of speed," said Marko. "We just have to get consistency into it. On the single lap we can improve but on the long run, the tyre wear is a problem at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that conditions may change in favour of Red Bull before the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow is a different day," he said. "You see it a lot of times. People will be fastest on Friday, or Thursday, but it doesn't mean that they are fast in the race. We will, for sure, make a reasonable step." (AFP)

<img alt="Ben Campbell leads the pack at the end of round two of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780434_1_20241122190618.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell on Friday shot a five-under 65 to surge to the top of the leaderboard at the Hong Kong Open, putting the defending champion one shot ahead of Thailand's Nitithorn Thippong as the competition entered the halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a dominant display for Campbell, 33, who took advantage of his familiarity with the course in Fanling to outperform his group comprising South Korean phenom Tom Kim and American Peter Uihlein under sunny and bright conditions, a far-cry from Thursday's wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell had a two-day total of 12-under 128, overtaking opening round leader Nitithorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – Australian Kevin Yuan, Kazuki Higa of Japan and Yongjun Bae of South Korea, who had the day's best score of 62 – were tied for third at 9-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho moved up the leaderboard in his bid to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China star had another solid outing with a round of five-under 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho and four others were tied for sixth at eight under at the end of round two, four shots behind Campbell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim and Uihlein, meanwhile, were among those missing the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today gave me a lot of confidence and proved what I was doing was working," Campbell told reporters after his strong performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think being out on LIV as a reserve this year really helped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being around some of the best players in the world, seeing what they do, allowed me to back up the things I've learned from the team around me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell also spoke about what it meant to be competing in the SAR again, as he looks to defend his title and add a second Asian Tour title to his resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've found a swing that my body seems to like a lot more," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning here last year was massive. It's always nice to come back to a golf course you really like and feel comfortable on, so it's definitely great to be back here again."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

    Ohtani, Judge win 2024 MLB MVP awards

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honour on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, 30, was a unanimous MVP for the third time, receiving all 30 first-place votes and 420 points in voting by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points, and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVP's here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me – which I think he’ll do.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani was unanimously voted the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting. He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record US$700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first player to twice become an unanimous MVP. He combined with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023 for the first year both MVP's were unanimous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He helped the Dodgers to the World Series title, playing the final three games with a torn labrum in his left shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter to win an MVP. He joined Frank Robinson for Cincinnati in 1961 and Baltimore in 1966 as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds with seven and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout with three each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Balloting was conducted before the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull Italy SailGP Team was on Thursday unveiled as the 12th and final entry for the 2025 SailGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Jimmy Spithill, who serves as the team's CEO and founder, the team will make its debut this weekend at the Emirates Dubai Sail Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian lineup includes double Olympic gold medallist Ruggero Tita as driver and twice world bronze medallist Giulia Fava as strategist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the team are three-time SailGP champion Kyle Langford, who made a surprise move from Australia, and grinders Matteo Celon and Enrico Voltolini, both veterans of America’s Cup racing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s debut comes after Spithill announced plans to form an Italian team following his departure from the US SailGP Team last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is one of two new entries in the global league this season, alongside the Mubadala Brazil SailGP Team.
  <br>
  <br>
  SailGP is an international sailing competition featuring high-speed races in identical F50 foiling catamarans, capable of reaching speeds exceeding 100 km/h.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league pits national teams against each other in a series of regattas held across iconic locations worldwide. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Jannik Sinner triumphed in singles and doubles to help Davis Cup holders Italy beat Argentina 2-1 on Thursday to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italy will face Australia after they earlier defeated record 32-time winners the United States with a tense 2-1 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first two Grand Slams this season, as well as triumphing at the ATP Finals last week without dropping a set, and blew Sebastian Baez away 6-2, 6-1 after Francisco Cerundolo comfortably beat Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 in the opening rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decisive doubles battle, Sinner and Matteo Berrettini shaded Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez 6-4, 7-5 to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they put me on the court in doubles I try my best," said Sinner. "Matteo played unbelievable today, he carried me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy booked a third consecutive return to the semi-finals and are favourites to win the Davis Cup for a second year running, in no small part because of Sinner's presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old is still waiting for the outcome of the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner beat Novak Djokovic in singles and doubles in last year's semi-finals on the way to helping Italy end a 47-year wait to lift the trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't have time to adapt to this court after the ATP Finals, so I'm very happy with how I handled the situation today," Sinner told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very good doubles pairing, he played unbelievable," he added. "I tried to stay there with Berrettini, he also gave me a lot of confidence to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  The doubles teams were tied until the ninth game of the first set when Sinner won three points and then Molteni clipped his passing shot which was heading wide to hand Italy the decisive solitary break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set was even tighter with Italy breaking for a 6-5 lead and sealing their victory with a Sinner smash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini more than held his own alongside Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're playing with Jannik the pressure is off a little bit, he's going to play great," said the world number 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's captain Guillermo Coria said he was pleased with his team taking Italy to the wire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It speaks of the respect Italy have for us, and my doubles pairing, that they put the world number one out there," he said. "We were close to taking out a powerful team like Italy." (AFP)

    Taichi Kho 'solid' as Thai star leads HK Open

<img alt="Taichi Kho says he got off to a slow start before playing better on day one of the Hong Kong Open. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780280_1_20241121190146.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local golfing sensation Taichi Kho said he had a "solid day" at the office as he shot a three-under 67 in the opening round of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  That put the Hong Kong, China star tied for 20th place, five shots off the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand led the pack at the end of day one with a sizzling round of eight-under 62.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appearing in his second Hong Kong Open, the 24-year-old Kho braved the rainy and windy conditions and teed off in a group comprising 2015 champion Justin Rose and American Patrick Reed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was a solid day overall," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Got off to a bit of a slow start, but I feel like Patrick [Reed] and Justin [Rose] were very encouraging of me to play well out there today, which allowed me to feed off of their energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learned a lot from how they played, which helped me get my momentum going midway through the round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the putts didn't quite drop, I still felt like I played well towards the end and did a lot of good things out there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho is bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open after his historic victory at the World City Championship last year made him the first Hong Kong player to win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand, along with Australian Kevin Yuan and Kazuki Higa of Japan, were a shot behind Nitithorn at seven under 63, tied for second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the other top finishers from the SAR, Jason Hak had a round of 66 and Michael Wong, like Kho, shot a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kho, the Hong Kong Open serves as a test match for the 2025 National Games, where he is set to compete in the event co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely want to represent Hong Kong, China," Kho said, as he weighed in on the opportunity to compete for the SAR on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This course has stood the test of time. It's one of the best ones we play out on tour, making it a great venue for the upcoming Games."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid eased into the Uefa Women's Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday with a 3-2 win over Dutch side FC Twente, while Chelsea also booked their places in the knockout phase with a win over Celtic en route to their third consecutive victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch hosts led through Jaimy Ravensbergen's opener, but Linda Caicedo levelled on the stroke of half-time before Madrid took control with goals from Signe Bruun and substitute Alba Redondo, who scored in added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twente pulled a goal back right at the end courtesy of Sophie te Brake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid are second on nine points but cannot be overtaken by Twente after winning both meetings between the teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can see Real Madrid going really far in this Women's Champions League campaign," said Danish forward Bruun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has always been my dream to win trophies," she added. "This one might be the biggest, so again, we're one step closer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, joining Real in the quarter-finals from the same section will be Chelsea – after they came away with a convincing 3-0 victory over Scottish club Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  England international Lucy Bronze struck with a volley in the second minute at Stamford Bridge, and Dutch midfielder Wieke Kaptein's header doubled Chelsea's lead midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eve Perisset added a third from the penalty spot in second-half stoppage time, as Women's Super League leaders Chelsea made it four wins from four in Group B to guarantee their passage to the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A great result. Really happy with the win, the three points, we are top of the table. It was really important to score the first goal especially really early in the game," Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We scored three goals, clean sheet, so a perfect night again," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have won all 11 games under Bompastor, who moved to London in May after three years in charge of Lyon. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 LPGA golfers will compete for a record US$131 million in prize money over a 33-event season in 2025, the tour's 75th anniversary campaign, LPGA officials announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the season-ending Tour Championship at Naples, Florida, next year's schedule was unveiled, including two new tournaments and two unofficial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total prize money will have jumped US$62 million in four years, next season's payout jumping 90 percent from the pandemic-hit 2021 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 season was another year of historic growth for the LPGA Tour, and with this 2025 schedule we will continue to improve on that growth," LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA's global schedule will begin two weeks later than this year and see competition in the United States and 11 other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The season-opening LPGA Tournament of Champions in Orlando on January 30-February 2 will be followed the next week by the Founders Cup at Bradenton before the tour heads for Asia in February and March for events in Thailand, Singapore and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA Match Play will be contested April 2 to 6 in Las Vegas ahead of the year's first women's major, the Chevron Championship at The Woodlands, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  May will feature two new LPGA events, the Black Desert Championship in Ivins, Utah on May 1 to 4 and the first LPGA event in Mexico since 2017, the Riviera Maya Open in Cancun on May 22 to 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second major, the US Women's Open, will be contested May 29 to June 1 at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, followed by the Women's PGA Championship on June 19 to 22 at PGA Frisco in Frisco, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year's final majors will be the Evian Championship in France on July 10-13 and the Women's British Open on July 31 to August 3 at Royal Porthcawl in Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA returns to North America until a late-season Asia swing with events in October at Shanghai, South Korea and Malaysia and a November stop in Japan before two final events, the Annika on November 13 to 16 and the 2025 season-ending Tour Championship in Naples on November 20 to 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean tournaments will include the biennial International Crown team event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FM Championship in Boston on August 28 to 31 will have a US$4.1 million purse, the first event to crack US$4 million in prize money outside of the majors and Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, nine tournaments will have elevated purses from 2024. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup for the fifth time as Jasmine Paolini beat Rebecca Sramkova to secure a dominant 2-0 win over Slovakia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number four Paolini triumphed 6-2, 6-1 in the second singles rubber to follow up Lucia Bronzetti's 6-2, 6-4 victory against Viktoria Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy were runners-up to Canada in last year's final but went one better in Malaga to become world champions for the first time since 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory capped a stunning year for Paolini who finished as runner-up at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable year, unbelievable, to finish like this with the Billie Jean King cup, it's amazing, I don't have words to describe it," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trying just to enjoy it, it's important to understand where you are, I feel lucky to be in this position – I feel lucky to be part of this team," she added. "I'm really happy that this year we could bring the trophy home again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, who won the competition in 2002, had never lost a BJK Cup tie in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underdogs defeated USA, Australia and Great Britain on a stunning run to this year's final, but Bronzetti breezed past Hruncakova in under 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Sramkova, ranked 43rd, survived two break points to hold for 2-2 in the first set but the superior Paolini broke for a 4-2 lead, which she consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian double faulted to hand Paolini two set points and the Italian took the first of them when Sramkova slapped a shot into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini broke in the second game of the second set and it looked like she might power to victory without a fight, but Sramkova immediately hit back to get back on serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova defeated Danielle Collins, Ajla Tomljanovic and Katie Boulter on Slovakia's charge to the final but Paolini was a bridge too far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Italian restored her advantage with a fizzing forehand to move 3-1 ahead and then consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having spent most of her career outside the top 50, 2024 has been a huge leap forward for Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  She broke again when Sramkova went long and served it out to seal an emphatic victory in one hour and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel so sad now, disappointed, but all respect to Italy, for what they did," a deflated Sramkova told reporters. "Maybe in a few days we will enjoy that we are second, and take something for the future from those matches." (AFP)

    Sports bodies that don't improve face subsidy cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 33 points as the Boston Celtics ended the Cleveland Cavaliers' 15-game unbeaten start to the season with a hard-fought 120-117 victory in the NBA Cup on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics unleashed a barrage of 22 three-pointers to overwhelm Cleveland, who clawed their way back to within two points of the lead late in the game after trailing by 21 early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite the Cleveland fightback, reigning NBA champions Boston held their nerve and kept the scoreboard ticking over to close out a deserved win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 33 points included six three-pointers while the Boston star added 12 rebounds and seven assists in an all-round Celtics effort that saw six players finish in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum said Boston's championship pedigree had helped the Celtics over the line as Cleveland threatened late in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of basketball, we've played in the biggest games," Tatum said. "NBA is a bunch of talented teams – guys are gonna make plays, they're gonna make shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time – how you respond shows your growth and how special your team is," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum admitted that ending Cleveland's unbeaten record, which has left them sitting on top of the Eastern Conference, had motivated the Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They came in 15-0 feeling like they were the best team; we felt like we were the best team – it's all competition. We were ready to play today," Tatum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston were quickly into their stride, rattling in five early three-pointers to sprint into an 18-8 in the opening minutes of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland rallied to reduce the deficit to 26-20 at the end of the first quarter, but the Celtics kept up the pressure in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum drained a superb three-pointer in the final seconds of the first half to give Boston a commanding 65-48 lead at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics stretched into a 21-point lead early in the second half, but the Cavaliers clicked into gear and came roaring back to close the gap to two points at 88-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum though had the last word, nailing an imperious three-pointer to give Boston a five-point lead heading into the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nip-and-tuck final period saw Cleveland repeatedly close to two points but Boston pulled clear in the final minutes to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland's scoring with 35 points while Evan Mobley added 22 with 11 rebounds and six assists. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Slovakia swept past Britain in the Billie Jean King Cup semi-final doubles decider on Tuesday to seal a 2-1 victory and set up a title showdown with Italy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Tereza Mihalikova saw off British duo Olivia Nicholls and Heather Watson 6-2, 6-2 in the decisive rubber. Slovakia, the 2002 winners, face last year's runners-up Italy in Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cried like a baby but now I'm very calm and ready for tomorrow," said an emotional Mihalikova. "We need one more win, then we can touch the trophy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia are into their second final having lifted the trophy the last time against Spain in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Jasmine Paolini's Italy reached a second consecutive BJK Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland. Four-time winners Italy last lifted the women's team trophy in 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu, who won the US Open in 2021, won the opening singles tie 6-4, 6-4 against Hruncakova to keep four-time runners-up Britain's hopes of a first final in 43 years alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rebecca Sramkova's comeback from a set down to beat British number one Katie Boulter 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 forced a decisive doubles rubber which Slovakia dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are just enjoying every match, we have got nothing to lose, we're just trying to do our best," said Stramkova. "I don't think the (doubles) girls have the pressure, I don't have the pressure either, because we're underdogs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu opened the first set with a break against Hruncakova, ranked 238th in the world, 180 places beneath her.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton led 5-2 with another break in the fifth game before Hruncakova found her footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian saved a set point, breaking back for 5-3 and then consolidating as Raducanu wobbled but then closed out comfortably on her serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sidelined with a foot injury since mid-September until this week, the 22-year-old at times struggled with her opponent's power but was otherwise superior. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Superstar Rafael Nadal's glittering career in professional tennis came to an end on Tuesday as the Netherlands eliminated Spain in the Davis Cup quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard, a 22-time Grand Slam winner, was defeated in the first singles rubber and after Carlos Alcaraz won the second match to send the tie to a doubles decider, the Dutch triumphed to snatch a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Botic van de Zandschulp in the opening singles clash, before Alcaraz defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (7/0), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the deciding doubles rubber, Van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof secured a 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/3) victory to set up a semi-final clash with Canada or Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  After years ravaged by injuries and not having played an official singles match since July, doubts hung over Nadal's involvement in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were resolved when captain David Ferrer confirmed he would play in the first singles rubber of the opening finals clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal appeared emotional during the Spanish national anthem, and over 10,000 fans filled the arena with chants of "Rafa, Rafa," when it ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was having an emotional day, nerves before what could be my last singles match as a professional," said Nadal. "The emotions hearing the national anthem for the last time as a professional were very special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal had won his last 29 Davis Cup singles matches out of 30 played after debuting in the tournament in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite giving every ounce of his energy in the second set and buoyed by immense home support, Nadal fell short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the beginning I think we were both nervous – the crowd was tough, understandably," said Van de Zandschulp. "That is what it is to play against Rafa in Spain – he is probably the biggest sportsman here in Spain that ever lived."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given his diminished physical condition Nadal, ranked 154th in the world, attempted to keep points short, with big serves and occasional flashes of his lethal forehand, followed by a classic fist pump and roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 80 Van de Zandschulp sought to put Nadal on his backhand and the indoor hard-court tournament was far from an ideal surface for the record 14-time Roland Garros winning 'King of Clay'.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman opened up two break points at 4-4 and took the second with a fine cross-court winner to claim the lead, and then converted his second set point to dampen Spanish spirits. (AFP)

    Guardiola set to extend stay as Man City boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola is set to extend his stay in charge of Manchester City by signing a one-year extension to his contract, the Athletic reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won six Premier League titles and the club's first ever Champions League since arriving at the Etihad in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach's current contract expires at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been speculation that Guardiola's time could be coming to an end with City facing an uncertain future due to an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's director of football Txiki Begiristain, a close ally of Guardiola, has confirmed his departure at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported that the 53-year-old will pen a one-year extension to his deal with the option for another year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola also signed his two previous contract extensions at City during the November international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions return to action on Saturday, looking to snap an unprecedented losing streak for their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has lost four consecutive games for the first time in his coaching career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hit by the loss of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri to a season-ending knee injury, City have fallen five points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after defeats to Bournemouth and Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also lost 4-1 to Sporting Lisbon in their last Champions League outing and were eliminated from the League Cup by Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won 15 major honours in total during his eight full seasons in Manchester, which also includes two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Club World Cup and one Uefa Super Cup. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China on Tuesday beat Mauritius 1-0 in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium to record their third consecutive victory for the first time in eight years.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a promising look for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood, as the win guarantees a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw – following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's goal in the 11th minute proved to be the winner, who cut in from the right wing to unleash a powerful left-foot drive just beyond the reach of Mauritius goalkeeper Kevin Jean-Louis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius had a player sent off in the 42nd minute for two yellow cards, but managed to hold on the rest of the way without conceding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory means Westwood is the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three straight games, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong are qualifying matches for the East Asian Football Federation, where they will take on Mongolia on December 8 and Chinese Taipei on December 14.

<img alt="Japan's Ao Tanaka and China's Wei Shihao and Lin Liangming are in action in Xiamen. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779963_1_20241119222713.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ruthless Japan moved to the brink of qualifying for their eighth straight World Cup after beating China 3-1 away from home on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Headers from Koki Ogawa and Ko Itakura put runaway group leaders Japan two goals up at half time before Lin Liangming pulled one back for China early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa snuffed out China's hopes of a comeback with his second of the game six minutes later in front of a vociferous crowd of 45,000 in Xiamen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were playing their first senior international in China in nine years and there is a long history of rivalry between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a heavy police presence outside the Xiamen Egret Stadium where hundreds of Japan fans were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loud booing greeted the Japanese national anthem before kick-off and the game was briefly stopped in the first half when a fan invaded the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win gave Japan five wins and a draw in Asian qualifying Group C and took them to within touching distance of a place at the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two teams in each of the three groups will reach the showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan are at home to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in their next fixtures in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China gave a much-improved performance after losing 7-0 to Japan in Saitama in their opening group game.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have six points from six games and are still in the hunt for a place at their first World Cup since 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan made several changes to the team that beat Indonesia 4-0 in Jakarta on Friday with Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma and Crystal Palace's Daichi Kamada among those dropping to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa opened the scoring in the 39th minute, planting a firm header past goalkeeper Wang Dalei direct from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan doubled their lead just before the half-time whistle and again it came from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Koki Machida flicked on Junya Ito's delivery and Itakura was unmarked at the back post to nod the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  China found the perfect reply to start the second half when Lin pulled a goal back for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie Wenneng cleverly dummied Wei Shihao's pass and Lin slotted the ball past goalkeeper Zion Suzuki.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's joy lasted just six minutes before Ogawa headed in another Ito cross to restore Japan's two-goal cushion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy reached a second consecutive Billie Jean King Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland on Monday in Malaga.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Swiatek came from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles rubber but the Italian earned immediate revenge over the five-time Grand Slam winner in the deciding doubles clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini and veteran Sara Errani overcame Swiatek and Katarzyna Kawa 7-5, 7-5 in the doubles rubber to send the four-time champions through to Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening singles rubber, Italy's Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Magda Linette in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed by Swiatek's three-set battle with Paolini which ran over two-and-a-half hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough today – the intensity was insane, I was a little bit tired but I said to myself, you still have to play the doubles, you have to give everything for Italy, for my team," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I lost the singles match I was a little bit sad, but then tried to go in the locker room and think positive about the doubles," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linette, world number 38, was largely outclassed by Bronzetti, ranked 78th, in the first singles rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 4-1 down in the second set, Linette battled back strongly to force a tie-break but was eventually beaten when she slapped a return into the net after saving one match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  It left the pressure on Swiatek to deliver, which she did in thrilling fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten every time in their three prior clashes and having never managed to take a set off Swiatek, Paolini battled with fierce determination from the outset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek crushed the world number four in straight sets in the French Open final earlier this year but found a vastly tougher opponent in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole saved two break points to hold at 2-2 and then broke with a fizzing forehand to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not deter Paolini, who doubled down and won the next four games, securing two breaks of her own, to claim the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek spurned three break points in the final game and showed signs of tiredness after helping Poland reach the semi-finals by winning both her singles match and a doubles rubber against the Czech Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini had done the same for last year's runners-up Italy against Japan but dug deep to keep Swiatek at bay until the 10th and final game of the second set, which the Pole won to force a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the players exchanged breaks in the decider, Swiatek eventually triumphed when Paolini went long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 13 of the 16 break points she faced, proving the stronger in the key moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it was tough, my energy level was down in the second set but I managed to get back and that was the most important thing," said Swiatek, explaining she had "no time to celebrate" as the job was not done yet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryan Zaragoza won and converted a late penalty to help Euro 2024 winners Spain beat Switzerland 3-2 in a Uefa Nations League dead rubber on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nations League holders, already guaranteed top spot in Group A4, twice took the lead but were pegged back by the already-relegated Swiss in Tenerife.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first Spain match on the island in 28 years and fans were able to celebrate a win after Bayern Munich winger Zaragoza's late spot-kick settled the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Luis de la Fuente changed his whole line-up from the win over Denmark on Friday, handing Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aitor Paredes his debut in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeremi Pino, a Canary Islander, sent Spain ahead on home territory after 32 minutes after Pedri's penalty was saved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Alvaro Morata won the penalty and handed Pedri, born in Tenerife, the ball to take the spot kick, but Yvon Mvogo saved the Barcelona midfielder's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here at home with a goal, the win – I can't ask for more," Pino said. "It was a very special game – full marks to the fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente sent on another Spain debutant at half-time in Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joel Monteiro levelled for Switzerland but a few minutes later Bryan Gil stole the ball back to restore Spain's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andi Zeqiri fired home from the spot after a foul by Fabian Ruiz in the 85th minute but Zaragoza ensured Spain could finish a spectacular year on a high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, on loan at Osasuna from Bayern, burst into the box and was brought crashing down by Vincent Sierro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaragoza clinically dispatched the resulting penalty to spark jubilant celebrations in Tenerife. (AFP)

    Bentancur gets seven-game ban over alleged racial slur

<img alt="Rodrigo Bentancur has since apologised to South Korean teammate Son Heung-min. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779739_1_20241118195332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur was on Monday given a seven-match domestic ban by the Football Association over an alleged racist remark made about teammate Son Heung-min in a TV interview.
 <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was charged by the FA in September in connection with an alleged breach of its rules during the interview in his home country of Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Juventus player, who has also been fined £100,000 (US$126,000), had been asked in June by a presenter for a Spurs player's shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replied: "Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur, 27, apologised to the South Korea international but because it was deemed an "aggravated breach," an independent regulatory commission panel was required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel upheld the charge and Bentancur will have to sit out Tottenham's next seven domestic fixtures, though he will be able to play in Europa League matches against Roma and Rangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA said in a statement that it was alleged that the incident constituted an "aggravated breach... as it included a reference – whether express or implied – to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rodrigo Bentancur denied this charge, but the independent regulatory commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son, speaking in late September, said: "He apologised straight afterwards when we had holiday. I was at home. I didn't even realise what was going on. He sent me a long message and you could feel it was coming from his heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said Bentancur had acknowledged his mistake and had pleaded for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur will not return to domestic action until December 26, missing Premier League matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Tottenham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Uruguayan has played 15 times for Tottenham this season, scoring one goal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

    Bills hand Chiefs first loss of 2024 NFL season

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)

 Britain knocked out defending Billie Jean King Cup champions Canada as singles wins for Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter completed a 2-0 victory in Malaga on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu powered through the first set of the opening rubber against Rebecca Marino and held off the Canadian in the second set to wrap up a 6-0, 7-5 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu saved seven break points as Marino tried to force a third set, eventually earning a break of her own in the 11th game before closing out the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments," said the 58th-ranked Raducanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 24 Boulter then brushed aside Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-4 to send Britain through to a semi-final against Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really happy with me level today," said Boulter, who produced another assured display after dropping only three games in her first-round match against Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to say, firstly, Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing a 1-0 up, so full credit to her for starting us off well," she added. "Really proud of my performance today. I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1981.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, the 2002 champions, overcame Australia 2-0 earlier in the day to make the last four of the competition for the first time in 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Rebecca Sramkova both won their singles ties as Slovakia backed up their victory over the United States in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another big country which we beat, and I'm so proud for the girls, for our team members, for our country – because we are a small country," said Slovakia captain Matej Liptak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it really means so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 241 Hruncakova emerged victorious against Kimberly Birrell 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 after over two-and-a-half hours on court to give the central European country the lead over Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova then needed just over an hour to win 6-1, 6-2 against former world number 32 Ajla Tomljanovic, who injured her knee in the third game of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have nothing to lose. That's why I think we enjoy it so much. We are doing good, and hopefully we're going to keep doing that," said Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek will lead Poland as they take on world number four Jasmine Paolini's Italy in the other semi-final. (AFP)

 World number one Nelly Korda captured her seventh LPGA title of the season and 15th career crown on Sunday, firing a three-under par 67 to win the Annika tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old American, playing her first event since being sidelined by a neck injury last month, reeled off five consecutive back-nine birdies to seize the crown by three strokes at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After taking some time off with an injury it was great to be back out here," Korda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing like being in the hunt," she added. "There's nothing like the adrenaline feeling going on the back nine, being in contention – I love it so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Im Jin-hee, China's Zhang Weiwei and England's Charley Hull shared second on 269 with Sweden's Linn Grant and American Rose Zhang sharing fifth on 270.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Korda's third victory in the event after taking the 2021 and 2022 titles and made her the first player since Taiwan's Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annika Sorenstam, the tournament namesake from Sweden, holds the record with 11 titles in the 2002 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is the first American player to win seven LPGA titles in a season since Beth Daniel in 1990 and four of Korda's victories, including Sunday's triumph, came when she trailed entering the final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensured she will be a heavy favorite at next week's season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda added to a 2024 LPGA trophy haul that began in January at the Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  It continued with wins at the Pak Se-ri Championship in Los Angeles, the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play ahead of her second major title at the Chevron Championship and the Americas Open in May, her most recent victory until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The neck injury kept Korda from playing in October in Asia and she had not walked a full 18 holes in nearly two months until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda struggled early with a bogey at the second hole then sandwiched a birdie between bogeys at the sixth and eighth holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that only set the stage for Korda's run of birdies from the 11th through 15th holes, going from two adrift to secure the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not a lot of happy thoughts at the beginning," Korda said. "You should have felt the nerves I was feeling on the back nine." (AFP)
