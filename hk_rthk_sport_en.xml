<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City survived a scare to beat giant killers Plymouth 3-1 and progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, after Crystal Palace striker Jean Philippe-Mateta was hospitalised in the Eagles' 3-1 win over Millwall.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had shocked Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round and were on course for another stunning upset at the Etihad when Maksym Talovierov headed them in front on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argyle boss Miron Muslic said it would be the "biggest honour" of his life to go head-to-head with Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  With FA Cup glory City's only realistic hope of silverware this season, Guardiola surprisingly rotated his side with Erling Haaland among those left on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was one of City's youngsters who took his chance to shine as Nico O'Reilly turned the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslic will be furious at the manner of both the 19-year-old's goals as he twice headed in from set-pieces under little pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Reilly's equaliser just before half-time calmed City's nerves before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that point Guardiola had summoned Haaland off the bench and he teed up the third for Kevin De Bruyne in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Big compliments to Plymouth for making our job so difficult. They were incredibly organised, but we played a good game," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace's progress into the last eight came at a cost as Mateta was stretchered off the field straight into an ambulance and taken to hospital in the early stages of their south London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was sent off just eight minutes in after catching Mateta's head with his boot as he raced out of the penalty area to clear the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Michael Oliver only issued a red card after a VAR review of the challenge, with Roberts winning the ball before accidently crashing his boot into Mateta's head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today," Mateta posted on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace later said he had been discharged from hospital after receiving 25 stitches "to a severe laceration to his left ear".
  <br>
  <br>
  Manager Oliver Glasner said the incident could have ended the Frenchman's career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career," said Glasner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace chairman Steve Parish described as the "most reckless challenge" he had ever seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made use of the man advantage to book their place in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japhet Tanganga's own goal put Palace ahead in the 33rd minute before Daniel Munoz prodded in the second seven minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth advanced to the last eight for only the third time in their history with a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Wolves after their 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson's 30th-minute opener for Bournemouth was followed by VAR controversy as Milos Kerkez had a second ruled out for offside after an eight-minute check when the new semi-automated version of the system broke down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha levelled for Wolves with a second-half rocket to force extra-time, but the Brazilian was sent off for violent conduct after repeatedly clashing with Kerkez just before the penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Matt Doherty missed when he had the chance to send Wolves through, Boubacar Traore hit the crossbar and Luis Sinisterra sealed the win for Andoni Iraola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milutin Osmajic taunted Burnley fans after helping Preston into the quarter-finals for the first time since 1966 with a 3-0 win at Deepdale.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the Championship sides played in the league two weeks ago, Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri accused Osmajic of racist abuse, allegations which the Preston striker denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnley players declined to shake hands with Montenegro international Osmajic before their latest meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osmajic got Preston's second goal late in the first half and celebrated by taunting Burnley fans with his hands cupped around his ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robbie Brady and Will Keane were also on target as Preston ended Burnley's 23-game unbeaten run. (AFP)

<img alt="O'Sullivan had been looking forward to playing in front of a home crowd in Hong Kong, after becoming an SAR resident last October.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

    Tennis star welcomes WTA rebranding

<img alt="Aryna Sabalenka at the Qatar Open 2025 WTA 1000 tennis tournament in February. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793781_1_20250301123815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka praised on Friday the WTA's mission to highlight the personalities of its athletes and called Saudi Arabia's investment in the women's tennis tour an important part of growing the game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WTA rebranding, complete with a new logo and "Rally the world" tagline, comes amid a rise in global viewership and a record US$4.8 million prize awarded last year to Coco Gauff for winning the WTA Finals in Riyadh, a tournament sponsored by Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot. We needed this refreshing moment for so long," Sabalenka told Reuters at a WTA-hosted cocktail party in Hollywood celebrating the tour's new look and mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big move and I hope it's going to help our sport to get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, a big-serving Belarusian who grew up admiring the power games of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, said giving fans a more intimate look at the stars of the tour would pay off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The WTA should show our personalities and what it takes to become a top athlete," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have to be an inspiration for the younger generation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Announced in May, the multi-year partnership with PIF marked the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership amid criticisms of the Gulf nation's human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been there a lot and they have passion for sport. Their help means a lot for us," Sabalenka said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support is very important for the WTA. I think all of us will be very grateful for their support."
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's ATP Tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" last year with PIF, which has pumped huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit. (Reuters)

    Jos Buttler quits as England's white-ball captain

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jos Buttler resigned as England white-ball captain on Friday after his team made an early exit from the Champions Trophy with back-to-back defeats against Australia and Afghanistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team," Buttler said. "Hopefully somebody else who can come in alongside Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) will take the team to where it needs to be.”
  <br>
  <br>
  England lost two high-scoring games in Lahore and conceded the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 against Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler said he would lead England for the final time against South Africa in the last group match at Karachi.
  <br>
  <br>
  England had a disastrous preparation for the Champions Trophy when it won only one of its eight white-ball matches against India before arriving in Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overriding emotions are still sadness and disappointment,” Buttler said while expressing his willingness to continue representing England as a player.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure, in time, that (disappointment) will pass and I can get back to really enjoying my cricket, and (will) also be able to reflect on what an immense honour it is to captain your country and all the special things that come with it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler replaced Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball captain in 2022 and only months later won the T20 World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a sharp decline in England’s white-ball cricket with three unimpressive runs at the 2023 World Cup in India, 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies and now the Champions Trophy. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Asian Games gold medallist, Stone Shek, on Friday announced his retirement from gymnastics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shek, 33, said on social media that it's been a difficult yet rewarding journey, saying gymnastics has been his life and he would give his career a full score of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to grow every day, from all the injuries to different low points in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I could choose again, I would choose gymnastics every time," Shek wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Staying committed to something difficult is hard, but it's the mindset that defines success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having taken up gymnastics as a boy, Shek said he has gone through everything after 26 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked his family, coaches, friends and supporters for "remembering him as the prince of gymnastics".
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek won gold at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon on the vault, and successfully defended the title in Jakarta four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also captured two World Cup gold medals in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek represented Hong Kong, China at three Olympics: London in 2012, Tokyo in 2021 and Paris last year.

    Spurs' coach Popovich says he won't return this season

<img alt="Popovich said he hopes to make a return to coaching in the near future. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793588_1_20250228074546.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovich said Thursday he won't return this season as coach of the San Antonio Spurs as he continues to recover from a stroke he suffered in November.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I've decided not to return to the sidelines this season," the 76-year-old coach said in a statement posted on the Spurs X account. "Mitch Johnson and his staff have done a wonderful job and the resolve and professionalism the players have shown, sticking together during a challenging season, has been outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to focus on my health with the hope that I can return to coaching in the future," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that the statement came after Popovich met with Spurs players – their first chance to see him since he suffered what the team has described as a "mild stroke" on November 2 at the team's arena before a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Mitch Johnson was named interim coach, with Popovich saying in December he was working toward a return to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich, the oldest coach in NBA history, has 1,412 regular-season wins and another 170 post-season triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has guided the Spurs to five NBA titles in his 29 seasons at the helm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also the USA to basketball gold at the Tokyo Olympics and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of fame in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich's stroke is just one of the setbacks for the young Spurs team this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team announced this month that second-year star Victor Wembanyama would miss the rest of the regular-season after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right shoulder. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leicester sank closer to an immediate return to the Championship after West Ham pulled clear of the bottom three with a convincing 2-0 win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek and a Jannik Vestergaard own goal did for the Foxes before half-time as the Hammers climbed to 15th and 16 points clear of the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Leicester won the reverse fixture in Ruud van Nistelrooy's first game in charge in early December, the Dutchman has overseen 11 defeats and one draw in 13 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goals we concede are easy goals. It's a reflection of how we played in the first half," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were way too passive," he added. "We are in a situation where we are not winning games and we are in a situation where we are in the bottom three. The pressure is on – we cannot wait and sit back."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were buoyant after their shock 1-0 victory at Arsenal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Graham Potter's men were well worthy of another three points and could have ran out much more comfortable winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a professional performance. Not fantastic, but we are delighted with two wins, two clean sheets and six points," said Potter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soucek had the simple task to tap into an empty net after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen saved Mohammed Kudus' effort from close range on 21 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen then took advantage of slack Leicester defending from a corner just before half-time and his shot deflected off the unfortunate Vestergaard beyond Hermansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Ferguson wasted the chance to score his first West Ham goal when his shot was blocked by Wout Faes after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the home side had already done enough to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves Leicester still five points adrift of safety in 19th and showing no signs of being able to stop a slide back into the second tier. (AFP)

    Russian chess grandmaster Spassky dies aged 88

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Soviet chess grandmaster Boris Spassky, who was famously defeated in the so-called match of the century at the height of the Cold War, has died aged 88, the Chess Federation of Russia said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The federation called his death a "great loss to the country", saying generations of chess players had learned from his matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the first to react was Soviet grandmaster Anatoly Karpov, who told TASS state news agency: "He was always one of my main idols."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spassky is best remembered for his duel with American Bobby Fischer in 1972, which was emblematic of the confrontation between East and West.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Soviet chess giant lived a checkered life, flitting between top-level clashes against the best players of the era and periods of virtual disappearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in 1937 in Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, Spassky showed prodigious talent early, becoming junior world champion and the youngest grandmaster in history at the time at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to play chess at the age of five in an orphanage, having managed to flee Leningrad with his family when it was besieged by the Nazis during World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the war, his aggressive style of play without fear of sacrifice was noticed by his peers and encouraged by the state, which provided him with a scholarship and a coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having made a strong impression, he found himself in the shadow of another rising figure in Soviet chess, Mikhail Tal, the so-called "Magician of Riga".
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not until 1961 that Spassky made a remarkable comeback by winning the USSR Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight years later he defeated his compatriot Tigran Petrosian to take the world title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I never set myself the goal of becoming world champion. Everything worked out by itself. I was progressing in leaps and bounds," Spassky said in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Spassky would keep his title for just three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1972 in Iceland he played the match that would define his career, against the American prodigy Fischer.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Cold War at its height and the Soviet Union having dominated the game for years, Spassky faced a must-win situation in his match-up with the eccentric 29-year-old, who openly criticised Soviet chess players.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a comfortable start for Spassky, the American roared back to win, ending an unbroken streak of Soviet world champions since 1948.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the loss was a slap in the face for Moscow, for Spassky it was a relief to be rid of a "colossal responsibility".
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can't imagine how relieved I was when Fischer took the title away from me. I freed myself from a very heavy burden and breathed freely," he said nearly four decades later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The iconic Cold War duel has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and films. Most notably it inspired the Walter Tevis novel "The Queen's Gambit," which was adapted into the acclaimed Netflix series in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at the time, in the wake of his defeat, Spassky fell out of favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four years later, in 1976, he moved to France, after marrying a Frenchwoman of Russian origin. He obtained French citizenship in 1978. Spassky did not return to the public sphere for years, until he played an unofficial rematch against Fischer in Yugoslavia in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last years of his life were marked by ill health and a mysterious family conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  After two strokes, he returned to Russia in 2012 with the help of a sponsor and against the advice of his wife and sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to start over from scratch, but I'm not afraid," Spassky said on Russian television after his return.
  <br>
  <br>
  A few years earlier, in 2008, he had visited the grave of his former rival Fischer, who died that year and was buried in a small cemetery in Iceland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do you think that the neighbouring spot is available?" Spassky asked journalists accompanying him on the visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spassky lived in Moscow and his relatives informed the chess federation of his death, its executive director Alexander Tkachev told RIA Novosti news agency. (AFP)

    Legendary Irish trio to retire at end of Six Nations

<img alt="Last year's Six Nations title-winning skipper Peter O'Mahony is as famous for his gardening skills as his rugby prowess. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793545_1_20250227214946.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three "legends" of Irish rugby, record caps holder Cian Healy, last year's Six Nations title-winning skipper Peter O'Mahony and fellow Test centurion Conor Murray will retire from international rugby at the end of the Six Nations, they announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  They are on course for what could be a fairytale ending to their Test career with an unprecedented third successive Six Nations title.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish have recorded three victories from three Tests in this year's tournament – though they host biggest rivals France on Saturday week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They round off their campaign against Italy in Rome on March 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whilst back-row forward O'Mahony remains a starter both prop Healy and scrum-half Murray have added invaluable support off the bench for several years as Andrew Porter and Jamison Gibson-Park respectively replaced them in the first-choice XV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trio have been pivotal figures in the success the Irish have enjoyed under Joe Schmidt and then his successor Andy Farrell – winning the Six Nations title five times including the Grand Slam twice since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It goes without saying that Peter, Cian and Conor are legends of not just Irish rugby, but Irish sport, and have each made a significant contribution to the success of Irish rugby for more than 15 years," said Performance Director David Humphreys in an Irish Rugby Football Union statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is still so much to play for with Ireland and their provinces and we will mark their careers at an appropriate time in the near future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Interim Ireland coach Simon Easterby, who is standing in for Farrell as he focuses on the British & Irish Lions tour of Australia, knows the trio well as he has been part of the Ireland coaching set-up for the golden era too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby, who has also shared in the major disappointment for all of them – the failure to get past the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals (2015/19/23) – said it had been a "privilege" to work with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have each played a huge role in the success of Irish rugby over the course of their careers and they continue to inspire their teammates around them," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Watching how openly they engage with players in their own position and continue to add value around the set-up is testament to their collective character and they are also adding real value on the pitch."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both 37-year-old Healy, who has 136 caps and broke Brian O'Driscoll's previous record last November, and 112-times capped O'Mahony, 35, will retire from all rugby at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time British & Irish Lion tourist Murray, who forged the at-one-time most feared halfback partnership with Johnny Sexton, will be 36 come season-end but is due to play for a club outside Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Healy and O'Mahony retirement should not be a problem as the former has established himself as a renowned knife-maker and the latter is almost as well known for his gardening skills. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Abraham Ancer is gearing up to defend his LIV Golf Hong Kong title this March, eager to relive the unforgettable moments from last year’s tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ancer secured his first individual victory on the LIV Golf tour in a dramatic playoff against Australia’s Cameron Smith and England’s Paul Casey at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican golfer said that playing in Fanling is not only enjoyable but steeped in rich history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really fun and you have to be extremely accurate, not necessarily hitting it very far, but it's like playing chess, you really have to pick your battles and know when to attack and when to hold back," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I like that kind of golf where you have to think about what you're going to do off the tee, so [Hong Kong] will always be a super special place for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the 2024 US Open champion, is also eager to return to Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  As captain of Crushers GC, he aims to lead his team in defending their title from last season, and deliver an exciting performance for the fans in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong loves their golf, and they thrive around golf. It was cool to see that last year, how much they embraced all of us and really wanted us to be there and just loved every second of it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s going to be a lot of fun going back there, being the US Open champion, hopefully [we will be] showing some fireworks and winning. I want to win this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament at the Hong Kong Golf Club will be the third event of the League's 2025 season taking place from March 7 to 9.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Ibrahim Zadran's 177 and five wickets by Azmatullah Omarzai helped Afghanistan knock England out of the Champions Trophy with a thrilling eight-run victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan posted 325-7 in a virtual knockout tie in Lahore and then bowled out England for 317 in 49.5 overs to stay alive in the race for a semi-final place while England have no chance of reaching the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joe Root's 120 went in vain as England lost regular wickets to lose their second straight ODI to the Afghans after their shock defeat in the 2023 World Cup in India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing 13 off the last six balls with one wicket in hand, pace bowler Omarzai kept calm to give away just four runs and dismiss Adil Rashid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Playing under the cloud of boycott calls from some British politicians over the plight of women in the Taliban-ruled nation, Afghanistan elected to bat in a bid to bounce back from their opening loss to South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they soon slipped to 37-3 inside nine overs before Zadran pulled the innings together with a fourth-wicket partnership of 103 with skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi, who made 40.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zadran, 23, later added 111 for the sixth wicket with Mohammad Nabi, who hit 40 in 24 balls. He took the England bowling apart and went past his previous ODI best of 162 in his 146-ball knock laced with 12 fours and six sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He not only broke his own record for Afghanistan's highest individual ODI score but also a tournament record, days after Ben Duckett's 165 in England's opening loss to Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it was one of the best ODI innings I have ever seen," said Shahidi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Wood's injury in the middle of his fourth over hampered England as the fast bowler managed just eight overs and went off with a knee issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply, England lost two early wickets to be 30-2 after senior spinner Mohammad Nabi struck with his first ball to send back Jamie Smith for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duckett attempted to hit back in a 68-run stand with Root to steady the chase but Rashid Khan trapped the left-handed opener lbw for 38.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harry Brook looked fluent in his 25 but fell caught and bowled to Nabi in a soft dismissal to further put England in trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Root kept calm and along with skipper Jos Buttler, who took time to settle before hitting two sixes, put on 83 runs to keep the chase going.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afghanistan bowlers kept up the pressure with dot balls and Omarzai got the skipper out for 38 off a top edge caught at deep square-leg and Liam Livingstone departed soon after.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Root hung on as he reached his first ODI ton in almost five years and 37 innings and with Jamie Overton kept chipping away with regular boundaries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Omarzai got the prized wicket as he had Root caught behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He played an unbelievable innings tonight. The way to handle pressure in a run-chase," said Buttler. "He needed one of the other top six batters to stay in with him and take the game deeper."
  <br>
  <br>
  The pendulum kept swinging as Omarzai dismissed Overton but despite Jofra Archer's late push England went down as the third team to be eliminated in the eight-nation tournament after hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved a giant step closer to the Premier League title with a ruthless 2-0 win against Newcastle, while Arsenal's challenge was left in tatters after a 0-0 draw against Nottingham Forest.
 <br>
  <br>
  With suspended boss Arne Slot watching from the Anfield stands, Liverpool opened up a massive 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal thanks to goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's other action, Manchester City won 1-0 at Tottenham, while 10-man Manchester United held on to beat lowly Ipswich 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is Liverpool who continue to hog the Premier League spotlight as an almost-flawless campaign approaches a memorable climax.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds look certain to win the Premier League for the first time since 2020, which will move them level with Manchester United on a record-equalling 20 English titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having won 2-0 at fading champions City on Sunday 24 hours after Arsenal lost to West Ham, Slot's men kept their foot on the gas to turn the title race into a procession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szoboszlai netted with a clinical finish in the 11th minute and Mac Allister's fine strike in the 63rd minute made it 20 wins and just one defeat from 28 league games this term.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, Slot has made an astonishing impact, which could yet include Champions League and League Cup glory as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds play Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16 first leg next week and face a rematch with Newcastle at Wembley in the League Cup final on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said his side would concede the title "over my dead body".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have a game in hand on Liverpool, but Arteta may have to accept the stalemate at the City Ground was the final nail in the coffin for Arsenal's attempt to win a first title since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  The toothless Gunners, playing without a recognised striker, managed just one shot on target at the City Ground, with Riccardo Calafiori hitting the post in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-placed Forest's surprise challenge for Champions League qualification has also hit the rocks after just one win from their last five matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Erling Haaland returned from injury to clinch Manchester City's victory at Tottenham as the troubled champions moved into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had missed City's previous two defeats against Real Madrid and Liverpool with a knee injury suffered against Newcastle on February 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norway star showed no rust with the first-half winner in north London as City climbed one point above fifth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Haaland's 28th goal in all competitions this season, with 10 of those coming in his last 11 games to silence the critics after a barren spell earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  After four defeats in their last six games in all competitions, this was a much-needed victory for City, who started strongly but rode their luck as Tottenham missed a series of second-half chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Harry Maguire's header earned Manchester United a hard-fought win at Old Trafford, easing Patrick Dorgu's embarrassment after his part in a calamitous Ipswich opener was compounded by a first-half red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maguire's second-half header ended United's three-match winless run in the league and lifted a little of the gloom after Monday's announcement of a second round of redundancies at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim secured just his fifth league win as United boss despite a disastrous mix up between Dorgu and keeper Andre Onana that gifted Jaden Philogene an early goal. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool manager Arne Slot will not be on the touchline for Wednesday's home match against Newcastle after he was handed a two-match ban and given a hefty fine for his behaviour in the Merseyside derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Tarkowski's equaliser for Everton deep into stoppage time in the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park on February 12 provoked chaotic scenes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff were sent off by referee Michael Oliver, along with Liverpool's Curtis Jones and Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA issued a statement on Wednesday saying an independent regulatory commission had sanctioned Everton, Liverpool, Slot and Hulshoff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was alleged that the Liverpool head coach acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards both the match referee and an assistant referee after the match had finished," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arne Slot admitted the charge, and the Regulatory Commission imposed a two-match touchline suspension and £70,000 (US$89,000) fine."
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, Everton have been fined £65,000 and Liverpool £50,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot and Hulshoff were both dismissed after approaching Oliver following the final whistle. Speaking about the incident at a press conference two days later, Slot admitted his emotions had got the better of him and he had "made the wrong decision."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I should have acted differently after the game, but it's an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that's definitely what I did," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Doucoure clashed after the Everton player celebrated in front of the Liverpool fans, leading Jones to confront him before players and staff from both sides raced over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot will be in the stands for Wednesday's game against Newcastle and the ban also covers Liverpool's home fixture against Southampton on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ban is for domestic games only, meaning he will be allowed in the technical area when Liverpool visit Paris Saint-Germain for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on March 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will also be on the touchline for Liverpool's League Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League leaders Liverpool are 11 points clear of second-placed Arsenal at the top of the table and are hot favourites to lift a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title. (AFP)

    Atlético hold Barca in eight-goal Copa del Rey clash

<img alt="Atlético Madrid's Marcos Llorente controls the ball against Barcelona's Frenkie de Jong. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793180_1_20250226074804.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Atlético Madrid conceded a two-goal lead then fought back from two down in a wild 4-4 draw with Barcelona in a Copa del Rey semi-final first leg thriller.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Diego Simeone's side scored twice in the opening six minutes through Julián Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann, Barca raced through the gears in a high-octane performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The superb Pedri Gonzalez pulled one back with Pau Cubarsi, Inigo Martinez and Robert Lewandowski going on to score for the Catalan giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Llorente netted for Atletico before Alexander Sorloth struck in the 93rd minute to leave the tie perfectly poised ahead of the second leg at the Metropolitano stadium on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a terrible result when you go 4-2 up," Pedri said. "You have to be more careful, these are things we have to learn."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we started badly but I'll focus on how the team reacted," he added. "When we got in front we have to be calmer. The second leg will be difficult, but we will go there to try and win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick left Barca's top goalscorer Lewandowski out of the starting line-up, with Ferran Torres taking his place in a false nine role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone picked a strong side despite his side's extremely tricky fixture list, with this the first of three matches against Barca and a Champions League last 16 tie against Real Madrid on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético took the lead inside the first minute, with Alvarez pouncing at the back post after Griezmann's cross was flicked on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético doubled their lead in the sixth minute when Jules Kounde gave the ball away and Alvarez produced a stunning pass to release Griezmann.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward was being pressured by Alejandro Balde but cleverly worked room for a shot, which Wojciech Szczesny got a hand to but could not keep out.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Atletico's opening salvo, Barcelona dominated the rest of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres should have levelled for Barcelona after Raphinha sent him through on goal but his shot was week and Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso saved easily.
  <br>
  <br>
  The La Liga leaders hit two goals in two minutes to pull back level, with Kounde setting up Pedri for the first before Cubarsi nodded home from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Torres spurned another golden chance for Barca's third, rounding Musso but misfiring under pressure from Clement Lenglet, on loan from the Catalans at Atlético. (AFP)

<img alt="Cheslea's Nkunku celebrates after scoring his team first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793177_1_20250226070748.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea moved into the Premier League's top four with a 4-0 demolition of hapless Southampton, but Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League football next season diminished after a 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a run of three consecutive defeats, Chelsea badly needed a response against bottom-of-the-table Saints, who are set for an immediate return to the Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues duly delivered with three first-half goals through Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Levi Colwill for just a third league win 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off at Stamford Bridge, a small band of Chelsea fans gathered to protest against the club's owners over the club's form and discontent over ticket prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once the action got underway, it was a much-needed comfortable evening for Enzo Maresca's men which the Italian will hope can restore confidence among his squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nkunku took his tally for the season to 14 but only three of those have come in the Premier League as he has often had to play reserve to the injured Nicolas Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman stooped to head in a corner at the back post before teeing up Neto to blast home a second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colwill headed in Neto's free-kick to make the points safe before the break. Marc Cucurella rounded off the scoring with a calm finish from teenager Tyrique George's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory takes Chelsea two points above Manchester City into fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to English clubs' strong performance in European competition this season, a top-five finish is likely to be enough for a place in next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa had rejuvenated their hopes of a second consecutive season in Europe's elite competition after beating Chelsea on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men have won just one of their last seven league games after a capitulation at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ismaila Sarr's first-half opener was cancelled out early in the second period by Morgan Rogers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta quickly restored Palace's advantage before Sarr and Eddie Nketiah maintained the Eagles fine form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oliver Glasner's side have won seven of their last nine games to rise to 12th, just six points behind Villa in 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton won the battle of the south coast clubs with ambitions of European football next season, over Bournemouth 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro won and converted a penalty on 12 minutes to give the Seagulls the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A wonder strike from Justin Kluivert levelled for the Cherries, but Danny Welbeck's winner moved the sides level on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth sit seventh on goal difference with Brighton in eighth, but now just one point behind fifth-placed City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves missed the chance to pull further clear of the relegation zone after a 2-1 home defeat to Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fast start to both halves saw the visitors take the points as Ryan Sessegnon struck inside the first minute and Rodrigo Muniz got the winner two minutes into the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves remain five points above the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  League leaders Liverpool can take another step towards just their second title in 35 years when they host Newcastle on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second faces third as Arsenal visit Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham host City. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rain washed out the Champions Trophy game between South Africa and two-time winner Australia on Tuesday without a ball being bowled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pitch remained under covers at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium throughout the day because of a persistent light drizzle before umpires called off the game shortly after 5 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both unbeaten teams go into their last Group B game with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals with three points already secured. Australia play against Afghanistan at Lahore on Friday while South Africa meet England at Karachi on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Australia began their campaigns by posting 300-plus scores against Afghanistan and England, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia, coming into the Champions Trophy without three frontline fast bowlers, made the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 on the back of Josh Inglis’ century against England at Lahore.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa registered an emphatic 107-run win over Afghanistan at Karachi after Ryan Rickelton made his maiden ODI hundred in a strong total of 315-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand and India have already qualified for the semi-finals after winning both their Group A games against Pakistan and Afghanistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  England will take on Afghanistan in a must-win game for both teams to stay in semi-final contention in Lahore on Wednesday. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Galatasaray have accused Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho of making "racist statements" following a 0-0 draw between the bitter Istanbul rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear what comments Galatasaray were referring to, and the former Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs coach Mourinho has not responded publicly to the allegation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking following their league draw at Galatasaray, the Portuguese coach reportedly said the home bench had been "jumping like monkeys".
  <br>
  <br>
  He also reportedly repeated his criticism of Turkish referees.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was refereed by Slovenia's Slavko Vincic, said to have been appointed after a request from both clubs that a foreign official take charge of the high-profile encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its statement, Galatasaray said it would launch criminal proceedings against the 62-year-old Mourinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Since the commencement of his managerial duties in Turkey, Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho has persistently issued derogatory statements directed towards the Turkish people," the club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today his discourse has escalated beyond merely immoral comments into unequivocally inhumane rhetoric," it continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hereby formally declare our intention to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the racist statements made by Jose Mourinho, and shall accordingly submit official complaints to Uefa and Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Furthermore, we shall diligently observe the stance adopted by Fenerbahce – an institution professing to uphold 'exemplary moral values' – in response to the reprehensible conduct exhibited by their manager."
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no immediate comment from Fenerbahce, who are second in the Super Lig six points behind Galatasaray. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World MotoGP champion Jorge Martin will miss the first race of the season this weekend in Thailand after sustaining several fractures in a fall, his Aprilia team announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard, who previously suffered several fractures when he crashed his Aprilia during pre-season testing in Malaysia, has a number of breaks in his left hand and also in his heel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is due to undergo surgery in Barcelona on Tuesday and "will miss the Thailand Grand Prix", the Italian manufacturer said in a statement. "Recovery times will be determined after the surgery."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest injury is unrelated to the Malaysia crash at the start of February when he broke his right hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia at turn two of the Sepang circuit, having emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old, who has already undergone successful surgery on his right hand, made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lorenzo Savadori will substitute for the reigning world champion in Thailand. (AFP)

<img alt="New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra celebrates after scoring a century against Bangladesh. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793008_1_20250225053556.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rachin Ravindra struck a superb 112 to lead New Zealand into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh, as hosts Pakistan were sent crashing out of the tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result in Rawalpindi also ensured India's semi-final berth in the 50-over tournament as Bangladesh became the other team from Group A to be knocked out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both New Zealand and India have two wins from two matches and will now meet in Dubai on Sunday to decide team one and two from the group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Feels nice to qualify," New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner said after the win. "Knew Bangladesh would be a challenge."
  <br>
  <br>
  Pakistan, who won the previous edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, lost to New Zealand and then India in the first International Cricket Council (ICC) event they are hosting since the 1996 ODI World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  India refused to tour Pakistan due to political reasons and instead are playing all their matches in Dubai, which will host the final if the Asian giants go the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand have been the team to beat in this group after they humbled Pakistan by 60 runs in the tournament opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming in as firm favourites in their second match, New Zealand elected to field first and spinner Michael Bracewell returned career-best ODI figures of 4-36 to restrict Bangladesh to 236-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing 237 for victory, New Zealand slipped to 15-2 and 72-3 before Ravindra and fellow left-hander Tom Latham, who made 55, added 129 for the fourth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both were dismissed before the end but New Zealand still achieved the target with 23 balls to spare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Caps had a disastrous start when pace bowler Tasking Ahmed bowled first-match centurion Will Young for a duck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh's new pace sensation Nahid Rana took down Kane Williamson caught behind for five with a delivery bowled at 148.8 kph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra, who returned to the team after recovering from a nasty blow to his forehead in a recent tri-series match against Pakistan, joined Devon Conway to rebuild the innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conway hit back with a flurry of boundaries and made 30 before Bangladesh checked the surge and Mustafizur Rahman hurried one on to the left-hander who chopped on to his stumps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra stood firm and with fellow left-hander Latham, another centurion in the opener against Pakistan, waded his way through the chase and after reaching his fifty bossed the bowlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  He raised his fourth ODI ton with a single off Rana and raised his bat to soak up the applause.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's doing Rachin things I guess," Santner said of his batter who hit a hundred in his ODI World Cup debut in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He loves ICC events – looks like he never left the game," he added. "He wasn't as fluid as he'd have liked but when he gets going he's tough to stop. His partnerships were good too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra's knock was interrupted by an intruder who barged on to the field to hug the batter before being escorted out of the ground by security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The young boy, wearing a white shalwar kameez, was carrying a photo of a leader of one of Pakistan's radical religious parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra finally fell, caught at long-on off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, and wicketkeeper-batsman Latham's run out added some late drama. But Glenn Phillips, 21 not out, and Bracewell, who hit the winning boundary, sealed the chase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Player of the match Bracewell set up victory with key strikes that started with his second delivery to dismiss Tanzid Hasan out for 24 and end a strong start by Bangladesh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto made 77 and Jaker Ali 45 in an attempt to put up a competitive total but Bracewell kept getting wickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was ably supported by the New Zealand quicks with rookie Will O'Rourke returning with two wickets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
  <br>
  <br>
  All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

<img alt="Mohamed Salah opened the scoring for Liverpool against Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792866_1_20250224053528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool took a giant stride towards the Premier League title as a 2-0 win over Manchester City opened up an 11-point lead over Arsenal at the top of the table.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah was again Liverpool's star performer as he opened the scoring with his 30th goal of the season in all competitions before setting up Dominik Szoboszlai to double the lead before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is special. Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible," said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade. "Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title."
  <br>
  <br>
  Just days after exiting the Champions League to Real Madrid, this was another sobering defeat for the dethroned English champions, who are now 20 points adrift of the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  So often during Pep Guardiola's glorious reign, Liverpool have come up just short in English football's great rivalry of recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, their time to match Manchester United's record of 20 English top-flight titles now appears just months away in Arne Slot's first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this," said Slot. "It is important to understand why we are where we are."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's shock 1-0 home defeat to West Ham on Saturday had eased the pressure on Liverpool, that had built after dropping points in two of their last three games at Everton and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A trip to the Etihad has for so long been the stiffest test of all, but City's defensive frailties were easily exposed and they also badly missed the presence of the injured Erling Haaland in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, by contrast, had their talisman fit and firing as Salah took his staggering tally this season to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian fired the visitors in front on 14 minutes thanks to a brilliantly executed set-piece routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister's corner was flicked by Szoboszlai into Salah's path and his shot deflected off Nathan Ake past the despairing dive of Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, City's own Egyptian international showed his ability to finish, but Omar Marmoush had strayed offside before being played in by Phil Foden.
  <br>
  <br>
  City winger Jeremy Doku was skipping past Trent Alexander-Arnold at will, yet the Belgian consistently failed to deliver a telling cross or shot. Salah was not so forgiving as he raced onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final outcome could have been much more humiliating for City had Liverpool had been as accurate on the counter-attack after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curtis Jones had a third goal ruled out by a VAR review for offside after Szoboszlai just failed to time his run through the heart of the City defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ederson was forced into a stunning save from Luis Diaz and only a brilliant last-ditch tackle from Abdukodir Khusanov denied Szoboszlai a second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marmoush scored a hat-trick in last weekend's 4-0 win over Newcastle and remained a lively threat as he flashed another effort across the front of Alisson Becker's goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City lacked the end product to make nearly 70 percent possession count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite an eighth league defeat of the season, Guardiola's men remain in fourth and will be confident of securing their place in the Champions League next season with a top-five finish likely to be enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, after an unprecedented run of four consecutive titles, City look like yesterday's team with Liverpool now champions in waiting. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed another test event has been scheduled next weekend -- the triathlon at the Central waterfront.

    Romantic Warrior claims second in close Saudi Cup race

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

<img alt="Luka Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792827_1_20250223135007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic delivered a dominant 32-point performance as the Los Angeles Lakers snapped the Denver Nuggets' nine-game winning streak on Saturday with an impressive 123-100 victory on the road in Colorado.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, playing only his fourth game for the Lakers since his blockbuster trade from Dallas, was in scintillating form as the Lakers conjured a statement wire-to-wire win over their Western Conference rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovenian superstar was the standout performer on a night when the Lakers saw four players finish with 20 points or more for the first time this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists while LeBron James backed him with 25 points. Austin Reaves added 23 points and Rui Hachimura 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm starting to feel a little bit more like myself, that's why I was smiling the whole game," Doncic said afterward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's still a lot of room for improvement and this is only my fourth game. Chemistry takes time. But you saw today that things are getting better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic had signalled he was in the mood for a stellar performance early in the first quarter, arrowing a couple of superb passes to James and Jaxson Hayes to help the Lakers take an 8-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sublime three-pointer from Doncic put the Lakers into a 31-18 lead as the visitors remained firmly on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished the first quarter with 16 points, four rebounds and three assists and was soon back into the groove in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A delicate lobbed assist to James for an alley-oop dunk made it 60-52 before Doncic unfurled a 24-foot three-pointer to put the Lakers 11 points up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets closed the deficit to 63-54 at the half, but the Lakers remained in control for much of the third quarter, taking a nine-point advantage into the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over in the fourth, and Doncic put Los Angeles into a 20-point lead at 117-97 with just over four minutes remaining after another Denver turnover to effectively ice the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 34-21 with the win and remain fifth in the West. The Nuggets fell to 37-20 with the defeat. (AFP)

<img alt="The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792765_1_20250222180132.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers boosted their NBA-best record with a 142-105 romp past the New York Knicks on Friday, tightening their grip on the Eastern Conference lead with an all-around dominant display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points to lead six Cavs players to score in double figures, connecting on five of seven three-pointers as Cleveland drilled 19 from beyond the arc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland out-scored the Knicks 66-38 in the paint and held a 23-6 edge in fast-break points, pushing their lead to as many as 42 on the way to a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 21 points and Jarrett Allen scored 10 before departing in the third quarter with a right hand injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland guard Darius Garland took a hard fall in the first half, striking his head on the court, but stayed in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 16 of his 26 points in the first quarter for the Knicks but was held scoreless in the second period as the Cavs roared to a 77-50 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns scored 23 points for New York, who are in third place in the East but fell to 0-6 this season against the three teams with the league's best records: Cleveland, Boston and Oklahoma City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the biggest thing was just try to set the tone early," Mitchell said, adding that the determination to dominate had nothing to do with the Knicks' first-round playoff win over the Cavs two seasons ago and everything to do with the fact that they could yet meet in this post-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's about how do we continue to build and get better," Mitchell said. "So we're trying to measure ourselves, continue to do what we've been doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City, stunned by a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves heading into the All-Star break last week, rebounded with a 130-107 victory over the Utah Jazz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. He added eight assists, two rebounds, three blocked shots and a steal in the wire-to-wire win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Orlando, where Memphis star Ja Morant drove for a layup that tied it at 104-104 with 1:50 remaining and Desmond Bane delivered the decisive free-throw in the Grizzlies' 105-104 victory over the Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 23 points while Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr added 16 apiece for the Grizzlies, with Jackson blocking a potential game-winner by Orlando's Paolo Banchero at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Jalen Green scored 35 points and Alperen Sengun added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets in a 121-115 victory over Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 37 points for the Timberwolves, but was held to just three in the fourth quarter as the Rockets, who led by as many as 14 in the first quarter, clamped down defensively to win a game that featured 20 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Kuzma, acquired by Milwaukee from the Wizards earlier this month, scored 19 points to lead the Bucks to a 104-101 victory over his former team in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, limited by foul trouble, scored 18 points before fouling out with 3:37 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, who arrived in Washington in the four-team deal that sent Kuzma to Milwaukee, scored 12 points against his former team in his Wizards debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton's three-pointer with 1:01 remaining pulled the Wizards within 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brook Lopez made a pair of free-throws and blocked a Middleton layup, and Middleton came up empty on a last-gasp three-point attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, fuelled by 35 points from Kyrie Irving, beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-103 for a third straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Cade Cunningham scored 25 points and handed out 12 assists as the Pistons notched a fifth straight win, 125-110 over the San Antonio Spurs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool will take on Paris Saint-Germain in one of the standout ties in the last 16 of this season's Champions League after the teams were paired together in Friday's draw.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool finished first in the 36-team league phase of the competition to qualify directly for this stage, while PSG had to come through a two-legged play-off tie in which they crushed fellow French side Brest 10-0 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg will take place at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 4 or 5, with the return at Anfield a week later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs last met in the Champions League in the group stage in 2018/19, when PSG won 2-1 at home after Liverpool triumphed 3-2 in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another eye-catching tie, reigning champions Real Madrid will play city rivals Atletico Madrid in a repeat of the finals of 2014 and 2016, both of which were won by Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern Munich will take on German rivals Bayer Leverkusen, while Arsenal face PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan take on Feyenoord, who are fresh from knocking out AC Milan in the play-offs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona will face Benfica, who they defeated 5-4 away in Lisbon in the league phase last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa will face Club Brugge, having already lost away to the Belgians in the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund will take on French side Lille. (AFP)

    Canada beats USA to win Four Nations Face-Off final

<img alt="Fans arrive before the big game in Boston. Canada eventually defeated the USA to win the Four Nations Face-Off ice hockey title. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792599_1_20250221130605.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In an ice hockey grudge match of border rivals fuelled by political tensions, "51st state" Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime on Thursday to win the Four Nations Face-Off final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Connor McDavid scored the title-winning goal off a pass from Mitch Marner to deliver Canada the victory after enduring political barbs from US President Donald Trump about being the "51st state."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game," outgoing Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- dubbed "Governor Trudeau" by Trump -- posted on X moments after the triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory came in the hard-hitting rematch of a bruising round-robin clash Saturday between NHL stars that produced three fights in nine seconds in a 3-1 US triumph -- but Canada won when it mattered most.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just to see the reaction, knowing what it means to us," McDavid, named the player of the game, said when asked the best part about the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not an Olympic gold medal but it means the world to our group. Everybody battled so hard. It was special."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the fight for bragging rights ahead of next year's Winter Olympics in Italy, Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington made several great saves early in overtime and 33 in all.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tone for a gripping contest was set when microphone-wearing referee Gord Dwyer said, "Let's get ready for an epic battle," just before dropping the puck to start the game, which went off without any brawling.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sellout crowd at Boston's TD Garden produced an electric atmosphere for one of the most hotly anticipated hockey games for years, an emotionally charged spectacle intensified by recent political sparring between the two North American neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense," US winger Matthew Tkacuk said of the buzz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This feeling is unbelievable. As big a game as I've ever played in in my life."
  <br>
  <br>
  US leader Trump ratcheted up the anticipation in a pre-game call to the American squad and social media remarks repeating his desire for Canada to become the USA's "51st state." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paulo Dybala scored twice as Roma beat Porto to clinch a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, as Ajax clawed through in extra time despite playing a man down for 95 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish forward Samu Aghehowa gave Porto the lead against Roma after a 1-1 draw in Portugal last week, but two quick-fire goals from Dybala turned the tie in favour of the 2023 runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porto were reduced to 10 men when Canada midfielder Stephen Eustáquio was sent off early in the second half, and Niccolo Pisilli struck what proved to be the crucial third goal for Claudio Ranieri's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devyne Rensch turned into his own net deep into added time as Roma progressed 4-3 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having a champion like Dybala means a lot. He's extraordinary; he says very little, but he is a leader and always says the right things," Ranieri said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma will find out whether they play Athletic Bilbao or city rivals Lazio in the next round when the draw for the last 16 is conducted on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a huge opportunity in Europe. This competition can give us a lot this year," said Dybala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, four-time European champions Ajax survived a huge scare against close neighbours Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium, nearly squandering a 2-0 advantage from a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Mac Allister's header halved the deficit and Promise David tucked away a penalty after Ajax captain Davy Klaassen was dismissed in the 25th minute for a deliberate handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kenneth Taylor's spot-kick in extra time was enough to put Ajax through 3-2 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  José Mourinho, a former winner of the competition with Porto and Manchester United, saw his Fenerbahce side go through 5-2 overall after a 2-2 draw away to Anderlecht in a match that was delayed in the first half by crowd trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt overturned a first leg deficit against Dutch side Twente with a dramatic 5-2 win after extra time in the Arctic Circle to progress 6-4 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts were heading out before striking twice in second-half stoppage time but Twente then levelled the tie and forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sondre Brunstad Fet put Bodo/Glimt back ahead in the 111th minute, with a second own goal of the night from Twente sealing qualification for their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, meanwhile, thrashed Midtjylland 7-3 on aggregate after a 5-2 win in San Sebastian. The Spaniards will take on United or Tottenham in the last 16. (AFP)

    Alcaraz knocked out by Lehecka in Qatar Open quarters

<img alt="The world number three Alcaraz was dealt his second loss of the year in the quarter-final upset. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792554_1_20250221073828.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz was sent crashing out of the Qatar Open in the quarter-finals after losing to Jiri Lehecka, as the Spaniard headed for the exit along with second seed Alex de Minaur.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alcaraz dropped the first set before recovering to level, and then led by a break in the decider, but world number 25 Lehecka won the final four games for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz entered the clash on a seven-match winning streak following his triumph in Rotterdam earlier this month but ran into trouble against a confident Lehecka, who won his second career title in Brisbane to start the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I don't know what I could have done better," said Alcaraz. "I have to give credit to him as well, because when he was down, especially in the third set, he didn't give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was returning pretty well, really aggressively, no mistakes, or almost no mistakes," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Lehecka will play British eighth seed Jack Draper on Friday for a place in the final. The Czech is through to the last four in Doha for the second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great," said Lehecka. "To win a match like that against a player like this is a super big achievement. I believed in myself and knew I had the level to produce this kind of tennis. I think the most important part was I believed in my game and did not back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper battled back to beat Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the last of the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini, a former world number six and Wimbledon runner-up, had knocked out Novak Djokovic in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrey Rublev converted his eighth match point against De Minaur to take his place in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, a Qatar winner in 2020, had to dig deep to down the Australian 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (10/8).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded Rublev let slip a 5-2 lead in the final set as De Minaur scrambled back into contention to force a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev finally got over the line, the 27-year-old saving a match point himself in a memorable quarter-final clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I had my first match point, I played really well," said Rublev. "I did everything amazing and he just played an unreal rally. He made the backhand down the line and I played a good volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then he makes a forehand pass down the line. In most of the matches, normally after these points, they win – it's a turning point," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I then started to get a bit more tight and more emotional, I was a bit unlucky," he went on to say. Then when I lost my serve, I said 'Okay, whatever, if I'm gonna lose, at least just try to do your best until the end'."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was his first win against a top-10 player since August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev's reward for his fourth semi-final appearance in Qatar is a meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian was leading his quarter-final against Daniil Medvedev 6-3 when the Russian had to retire. (AFP)

    Wembanyama to miss rest of NBA regular season
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The injury comes after Wembanyama made his first All-Star appearance this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792542_1_20250221053538.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the NBA season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the team announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs said in a statement that the 21-year-old French player was diagnosed with the blood clot after he returned to San Antonio following last Sunday's All-Star game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season," the Spurs said. "The team will provide updates as appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement brings a premature end to another outstanding campaign by Wembanyama, who earned Rookie of the Year honours last season after being taken first overall in the NBA draft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's tough," San Antonio's veteran point guard Chris Paul said of losing Wembanyama, who was averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-best 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other NBA players have dealt with similar health concerns. Chris Bosh, a two-time NBA champion with the Miami heat, was ultimately forced to retire at the age of 32 after repeatedly dealing with blood clots.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Detroit Pistons' Ausar Thompson has returned to play 33 games this season afer he was diagnosed with a blood clot in March of last year. Brandon Ingram, now with the Toronto Raptors, recovered after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right arm in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it's a big blow for a player who made an immediate impact on arriving in the league and whose influence is only growing in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama became an All-Star for the first time when he was chosen as a reserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young Minnesota star Anthony Edwards noted Wembanyama's rise during All-Star weekend when he was asked if he considered himself a candidate for "next face of the league".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not really," Edwards said, "That's what they've got Wemby for."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs have reportedly indicated they expect Wembanyama to make a full recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the team's announcement didn't rule out the possibility that Wembanyama could be fit for the playoffs, the chances of San Antonio reaching the post-season without him look slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs are in 12th place in the Western Conference, two spots away from the final play-in berth now held by the Golden State Warriors.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's High Court has found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and fined him over 10,000 euros (US$10,434), the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It acquitted him of charges of coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales, 47, in a case that caused heated debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said in a statement it had also acquitted Rubiales' three co-defendants who were accused of attempting to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ensuing furore overshadowed Spain's victory in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales has maintained through this month's trial that Hermoso had consented to be kissed amid the celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fine was set at 20 euros a day over an 18-month period. (Reuters)

    Handball National Games trials to be held this weekend

<img alt="Yeung Tak-keung said a series of trials for the National Games will take place in Hong Kong in the coming months. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792464_1_20250220161403.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

    Mbappé hat-trick dumps City out of Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck a brilliant hat-trick for Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 3-1 win over Manchester City, helping Los Blancos reach the last 16 with a 6-3 aggregate victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side, shorn of key striker Erling Haaland, suffered a painful early exit without laying a glove on the completely dominant 15-time record winners in the Spanish capital, until Nico González tapped home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  French superstar Mbappé broke the deadlock with a lob in the fourth minute and netted a fine second after combining with his attacking partners as the English side were sliced open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker, in sensational form after a slow start to life at Madrid, completed his treble in the second half with a low strike from the edge of the box to reach seven goals in the competition this season in 10 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to win and go through because for us it was logical that Real Madrid would be in the last 16 of the Champions League," Mbappé said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has scored 28 goals this season, with 18 in his last 18 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said it before, I didn't come to Real Madrid to play badly," continued Mbappé. "Making my dream come true is one thing, but I want to play well here – mark an era and make history at Real Madrid."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who won the competition in 2023, were a far cry from their best as has been the case for much of their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best team won, they deserve to be there and we don't," admitted Guardiola. "We had a bad year in the competition – when you finish 22nd in the group, it's because we haven't been good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been our worst year," he added. "We've been an incredible team and this year, for many reasons, we have lost that consistency."
  <br>
  <br>
  City were dealt bad news before the game with Haaland, who netted twice in the first leg, named on the bench after a suffering a knock at the weekend against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side performed almost flawlessly from the off and took the lead in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé shrugged off Ruben Dias and lofted the ball over City goalkeeper Ederson after young centre-back Raul Asencio played him in with a long pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy when you concede such an early goal," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Stones limped off for the visitors a few minutes later in another blow for the Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé netted his second in the 33rd minute after Madrid's "fantastic four" star players combined. Jude Bellingham fed Vinicius who rolled the ball across for Rodrygo, who nudged it to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Paris Saint-Germain forward slipped inside to leave the flailing Josko Gvardiol sliding in the wrong direction and drilled home at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City only had "one percent chance" of beating Madrid and his team played like they believed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's only blot on their copybook was a booking for Bellingham for fouling England team-mate Phil Foden, leaving him suspended for the last 16 first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham, who caused a stir after being sent off for dissent last weekend in La Liga, was assured in midfield but the night belonged to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, opening up some space on the edge of the box and firing beyond Ederson as City's defence stood off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé departed to a standing ovation and Madrid fans marvelled at the ease of their team's victory, against an opponent with whom they have shared many close battles in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors pulled a goal back in stoppage time when Omar Marmoush crashed a free-kick against the crossbar and González rolled home the rebound, but it offered scant consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost 13 games in their last 26 across all competitions, and face Premier League leaders Liverpool next on Sunday, with a battle to finish in the top four on their hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Madrid the last 16 is a clash with either city rivals Atletico or German champions Bayer Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a complete game in attack, defence, possession and transition," said a satisfied Ancelotti. (AFP)

    Liverpool's title charge dented by Aston Villa draw

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title charge was slowed by Aston Villa after a pulsating 2-2 draw left neither side satisfied.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's men open up an eight-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Arsenal, but the Gunners now have a game in hand over the Reds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool led through Mohamed Salah but were also forced to come from behind after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins swung momentum in Villa's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected shot secured a point for the visitors, but it should have been more as substitute Darwin Núñez missed a glorious chance to snatch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down," said Slot on Núñez's late miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you watch the game back we created far more chances than them, we did everything we needed to do. The only thing that wasn't perfect was conceding from a set-piece."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, could also have won it in stoppage time as Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen went close.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A draw I think is fair for both teams because they had also chances to score," said Villa boss Unai Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are now 22 Premier League games unbeaten, but a second 2-2 draw in eight days offers Arsenal hope in the title race, especially as Slot's side visit Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy where we are," added Slot. "A bit too much now we played games where we deserve more than we got. "We want to achieve something together this season and we have all the ingredients for it but still 12 games to go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were handed their first Villa starts by Unai Emery as he reacted to a disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Ipswich on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford nearly had a hand in the opening goal but had strayed offside before his cross was turned into his own net by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were masters of their own downfall when the opener did arrive on 29 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andres Garcia's backpass went straight to Diogo Jota, who unselfishly squared for Salah to fire in his 29th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were level within nine minutes as Liverpool failed to properly clear a free-kick into the box and the ball fell kindly to Tielemans, who produced a classy finish on the volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota should have restored the visitors' advantage immediately when be blazed high and wide with just Emi Martínez to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead it was Villa who led at half-time as poor Liverpool defending allowed Watkins a free run to meet Lucas Digne's cross with a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford's one big chance to make his mark for his new club arrived just seconds into the second half when he skipped past the onrushing Alisson Becker, but could not beat Ibrahima Konate's towering presence as the French defender headed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liverpool onslaught duly followed to extend Slot's run of never having lost an away Premier League game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota curled a fine effort from the edge of the box off the bar. Alexander-Arnold was a growing influence on the game when he levelled on the hour mark with the aid of a deflection off Tyrone Mings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot threw on Luis Díaz and Núñez off the bench in search of a winner and one of his substitutes should have delivered a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Núñez had an open goal to aim at after being picked out by Dominik Szoboszlai but fired over to the disbelief of his manager. Martínez then had to rush off his line to deny Nunez another clear run on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, had the majority of the chances in a frantic finale. Jacob Ramsey's strike was ruled out for offside before Rogers and Malen's powerful drives flew just off target. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United paid a total of £14.5 million (US$18.3 million) to sack manager Erik ten Hag, sporting director Dan Ashworth and other members of their football staff, according to the fallen English giants' latest accounts published on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  United, the 20-time champions of England, are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table following Sunday's 1-0 loss at Tottenham, with only West Ham and Wolves between them and the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope for a 'bounce' in results under new manager Ruben Amorim has failed to materialise since the Portuguese boss replaced Ten Hag, who was sacked in October just 116 days after United triggered a clause to extend the Dutchman's contract until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  A costly decision taken by minority owner Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group was compounded by the rapid exit from Old Trafford of Ashworth, who arrived from Newcastle on July 1 following lengthy talks only to leave on December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial expense of those decisions was laid bare in United's results for the quarter ending December 31 under 'exceptional items'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £14.5 million," said a United press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This relates to costs associated with the departure of former men's first team manager Erik ten Hag and various members of football staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million, indicating Ashworth's departure cost some £4.1 million. (AFP)

    WTA to ban man after Raducanu 'security incident'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu was targeted by "a man who exhibited fixated behaviour" during the WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, tennis officials said on Wednesday, after the former US Open champion was reduced to tears on court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old Briton was down 2-0 in the first set against Karolina Muchova on Tuesday when she approached the umpire, then briefly took refuge behind the umpire's chair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muchova went over to see what was wrong before the 2021 New York champion Raducanu reappeared, wiping away tears with her towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Women's Tennis Association said it would ban the man after what it called "the security incident in Dubai."
  <br>
  <br>
  "On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty-Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, a London court issued a five-year restraining order against a man who stalked the British tennis star, including making several visits to her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA said in its statement that it "is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Republic's Muchova won the second-round match 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 94th minute strike by Alphonso Davies to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and a 3-2 aggregate win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern will face either their fellow German rivals Bayer Leverkusen or Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic had led 1-0 since the 63rd minute and the Scottish side had been on the verge of taking the German giants to extra time and pulling off their first ever win in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with Harry Kane off injured and time running out, Davies stepped up as Bayern's saviour, tapping in after Celtic keeper Kasper Schmeichel had kept out Leon Goretzka's header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern went into this game 2-1 up from last week's first leg at Celtic Park and seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated possession in the first half but Celtic were more dangerous with at least three clear cut chances to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Bayern Munich second-team player, Nicolas Kuehn beat Manuel Neuer but Raphael Guerreiro cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, Alistair Johnston flashed a dangerous ball across the Bayern goal. With Neuer stranded the ball flew just beyond Daizen Maeda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then Maeda missed a golden opportunity to put Celtic ahead. When Dayot Upamecano was forced into a stray pass, Kuehn led the surge forward and fed Maeda, who blazed over with Kuehn and Jota in support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated the ball on a freezing night but suffered with a lack of quality in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serge Gnabry was wasteful while Kane sometimes cut an isolated figure, starved of service. The England captain's best chance saw him rattling the bar with a snapshot after Josip Stanisic picked him out from the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would be Kane's final action. The striker was withdrawn at half time, feeling the effects of an injury picked up against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern upped the pressure after the break and fashioned a clear chance when Goretzka went clean through. Schmeichel, however, made a crucial stop to keep Celtic in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, Celtic were in front. Maeda seized on a loose pass by Josip Stanisic and helped it on toward Kuehn. Min-Jae Kim reached the ball first but could not clear and Kuehn was able to take a touch and find the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a goal that shocked the Allianz Arena and threatened Bayern's record of 20 European home games unbeaten. Celtic were delivering on coach Brendan Rodgers' pre-match battle cry to show bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern sought an equaliser but Vincent Kompany's side were reduced to long-range shots, with Schmeichel pulling off saves from Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and substitute Leroy Sane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic were moments away from inflicting Bayern's first defeat by a Scottish team and taking the tie into extra-time but the game had a sting in the tail. Olise delivered a pinpoint cross that was met by Goretzka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmeichel saved but Davies scrambled the rebound home off his shin to send Bayern through to the last 16. (AFP)

    Berrettini ends Djokovic comeback at Qatar Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's comeback came to a crashing halt as he lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 to Matteo Berrettini in the second round of the Qatar Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who was seeded third and received a first-round bye, was playing his first match since limping out of his Australian Open semi-final in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb said that while he was not 100 per cent, fitness was not the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was outplayed by just a better player today," he said. "Yes, I wasn't at my desired level, and it could be that I'm still not moving the way I want to move, but I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he played a masterclass match to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Berrettini's second win this year, and his first over a player in the top 10 since 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Italian's first ever win over Djokovic. Their previous encounters included victories for the Serb in the Wimbledon final and Roland Garros quarterfinals, both in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Something I've been looking to do for a long time. I've played against him in the most important tournaments on tour," the 28-year-old Italian said on court after the victory. "I wish I could have won one of those matches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini has struggled with injuries over the last 18 months but won three tournaments after returning to court last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really happy with my performance," he said. "Really happy because I enjoyed my time out there, which is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went with serve but Berrettini took two points off Djokovic's serve to win the tiebreak. The Italian then broke to love in the second game of the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic had broken Berrettini 27 times in their four previous encounters but the Italian was comfortable on serve until the final game before finally winning on his second match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A champion like Novak is always ready to come back," Berrettini said. "You don't have to think about match point. You have to think about the next point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic said that Andy Murray had agreed to continue as his coach "indefinitely" but said that he did not plan to overhaul his style.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am trying to improve my game, like everybody else. But my game is not going to change now drastically," Djokovic said. "My game is what it is, the core is going to be the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more injuries. Things are not the same as 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis, and it's more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur celebrated his birthday by beating Russian Roman Safiullin 6-1, 7-5, even though the Australian did not enjoy the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're tough days, these ones," said De Minaur. "It's cold, it's windy, you probably don't want to get out of bed. But once you step on court, you have to do everything you can to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's ugly or pretty tennis, you just put the ball in the court, and that's what I did today," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, world number six Daniil Medvedev eliminated compatriot and defending champion Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev has not won a tournament since the Rome Masters in spring 2023. He was knocked out in the second round of this year's Australian Open by teenage American Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third Russian former champion, Andrey Rublev, the fifth seed, beat Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

    Djokovic calls for revamp of tennis anti-doping system

<img alt="Djokovic speaks to reporters ahead of the ATP Qatar ExxonMobil Open 2025 men's tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792046_1_20250218080329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic has urged tennis authorities to overhaul the sport's anti-doping system, pointing to "inconsistencies" in cases involving top stars Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek and those of lower-ranked players.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner agreed to a three-month ban on Saturday, admitting "partial responsibility" for mistakes by his team which led to him twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was facing a potential ban of two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his initial exoneration by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprising move, WADA withdrew its appeal and came to an agreement with Sinner to accept a three-month ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-profile case last year, five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a majority of the players that I've talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It seems like, it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the recently retired Simona Halep, a former world number one, was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug roxadustat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She argued it was the result of a tainted supplement and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which reduced her suspension to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have gotten the ban for years," said Djokovic. "There is so much inconsistencies between the cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who is returning to action this week at the Qatar Open for the first time since retiring injured from last month's Australian Open semi-finals, believes a change is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work for anti-doping, it's obvious," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes," he added. "It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what's happening, then there's no consistency, then there is no transparency, and some cases are transparent, some are not," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and ITIA, and the whole process." (AFP)

    Team Shaq wins NBA All-Star revamp as James sits out

<img alt="Team Shaq’s OGs celebrate after winning the 2025 NBA All-Star match in San Francisco. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791953_1_20250217121940.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shaq's OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament in NBA history, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry to beat Chuck's Global Stars 41-25 in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was over early, as the Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victor Wembanyama – the first-time All-Star who vowed that he would play hard, and did – led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format – four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league went to the tournament format of untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game, with Nikola Jokic missing both shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Shaq's win came on the heels of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James' annoucement of his withdrawal from the game prior to tip-off, citing a nagging ankle and foot injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will not see anything from me tonight," James, 40, said. "Unfortunately I will not be in uniform tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately," he added. "You know I hate that. But I'm looking forward to seeing the format." (AP/AFP)

    18-year-old Fonseca captures Argentina Open crown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca became the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history when he swept past home hope Francisco Cerundolo in the final of the Argentina Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old, ranked 99 in the world and playing in his first tour-level final, came through 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) against his 28th-ranked opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca twice unsuccessfully served for the match but regrouped to claim victory in the tie-break in a frenzied atmosphere in Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 ATP NextGen champion is the youngest male player from South America to win a tour title while his victory will also see him rise to 68 when the new rankings are released on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable week, even in Argentina there are some Brazilians cheering for me," Fonseca said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's just amazing. Every Brazilian, everyone from their country wants this support from your own country. For me, this moment that I'm living is just unbelievable," he added. "Of course I want to be number one, of course I want to win Slams, titles, but my dream is just to play tennis, and I'm living it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, seeking his fourth career title, was broken in the seventh game of the first set and fought off Fonseca when the teenager served for the trophy at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Brazilian impressively held his nerve in the tie-break and celebrated his triumph by collapsing in joy on the dusty, clay surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca made his maiden final the hard way – in Friday's quarter-finals he saved two match points to defeat Mariano Navone in a match six minutes shy of three hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, he defeated four Argentinian players on the road to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had already announced himself on the scene in January when he came through qualifying at the Australian Open and defeated top 10 player Andrey Rublev in the first round. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Luis Díaz ended his goal drought to spark a tense 2-1 win against struggling Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side got back on track after an unexpectedly poor week thanks to Díaz's first goal in 2025 and yet another Mohamed Salah strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz opened the scoring early in the first half at Anfield as the Colombian forward finally scored for the 13th time this term after 10 games without a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Díaz has struggled to find the net, Salah is in red-hot form and his penalty before the interval took the Egypt star to 28 goals in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha netted in the second half for fourth-bottom Wolves, but although Liverpool looked tired in a disjointed, nervous, climax, they held on for a valuable victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had gone two games without a win – an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round loss at second tier Plymouth last weekend and the stormy 2-2 draw at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester on Saturday had applied a little more pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds responded to Arsenal's challenge as they moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, who last won the Premier League in 2020, will be within touching distance of the crown if they take maximum points from trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle over the course of the next 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool boss Slot was in the dug-out despite being charged with abusive behaviour after angrily approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the Merseyside derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was furious that James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser was not disallowed because of a possible push by Toffees striker Beto on Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had urged Liverpool to use their "anger" from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  They didn't have to wait long to light the fuse as Díaz bagged his first league goal at Anfield since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham won the battle of the Premier League's underachievers 1-0 to inflict another dismal result on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored the only goal on 13 minutes as Spurs moved above United in the table into 12th thanks to a third win over the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory eased the pressure on under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou after exiting both domestic cup competitions this month to go with their lowly league position.
  <br>
  <br>
  United now find themselves down in 15th, but do enjoy a 12-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me," said Amorim, who has won just four of 14 Premier League games since taking charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about," he added. "I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's first home league win since November came amid a spirit of revolt among their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off and after the match Spurs fans again vented their frustration towards owners ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner read "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy – time for change" as a sizeable contingent of the home crowd joined a protest calling for Levy to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the mood for Postecoglou was lifted even before kick-off as he was able to welcome back a host of first-team regulars who have been sidelined by injury. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded line-ups of the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing into US borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came three fights in nine seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," USA coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred – I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not pre-arranged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' - none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight in the mayhem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top NHL players from the USA and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the USA went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period. (AFP)

<img alt="A textbook header from Mikel Merino set the Gunners on their way. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791802_1_20250215223425.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal brushed off their shortage of specialist strikers on Saturday as midfielder Mikel Merino scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Leicester City that kept the north London club's Premier League title challenge on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merino's brace allowed second-placed Arsenal to cut Liverpool's advantage to four points although the leaders will be confident of replying against Wolverhampton Wanderers ,later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champions Manchester City's title hopes may have long since vanished but they looked much more recognisable as recent signing Omar Marmoush bagged a hat-trick in 13 first-half minutes in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win allowed City to climb into fourth place with 44 points, three points behind Nottingham Forest whose top-four ambitions suffered a dent in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth's challenge for the top four shows no sign of petering out as they won 3-1 at bottom club Southampton to move above Chelsea and Newcastle into fifth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  When German forward Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season this week, joining Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Sako on the injured list, Arsenal fans must have feared the worst.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta gave Raheem Sterling a place in his starting line-up at Leicester but the former Chelsea man had a torrid afternoon and was replaced by Merino after 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard's impact was decisive as he broke the deadlock in the 81st minute from an assist by impressive teenager Ethan Nwaneri and he wrapped up the points in the 87th minute after good work by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the game started to suit (Merino) more because they started to defend much deeper, and we had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. "We believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Arsenal stayed on Liverpool's heels, Leicester's plight is precarious. They are 19th with 17 points after losing nine of their last 10 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Marmoush had not scored for City since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt last month but he opened his account in explosive fashion against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Marmoush gave City the lead in the 19th minute with a lob after Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier misjudged goalkeeper Ederson's long delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five minutes later he latched on to a pass from Ilkay Gundogan to fire home and then completed his hat-trick with a thumping shot after good work by Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew sooner or later he would score goals, he is a good finisher. Of course he has to improve, but now we see how he handles the compliments," manager Pep Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only blemish for City was Erling Haaland being forced off with an injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have not spoken to the doctor, but I was scared when he went down. Maybe it's not as bad as it could be," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood scored his 18th league goal of the season for Forest but it could not prevent his side slipping to defeat at Fulham for whom Emile Smith Rowe opened the scoring and Calvin Bassey headed the winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth moved to fifth with 43 points, just one behind Manchester City, as goals by Dango Ouattara, Ryan Christie and Marcus Tavernier sealed the points in the south coast derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation battlers Ipswich Town secured a well-earned point in a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Axel Tuanzebe was dismissed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich still went ahead after the break when Liam Delap steered in Omari Hutchinson's low cross but Ollie Watkins equalised for Villa who dropped to ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich are in 18th place with 17 points, two behind 17th placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleventh-placed Brentford beat West Ham United 1-0 away thanks to an early goal by Kevin Schade. They have now won three successive away games in the top flight for the first time ever. (Reuters)

    Tennis world number one Sinner gets 3-month doping ban

<img alt="Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner says he accepts responsibility for his team's mistakes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791789_1_20250215183106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis after the world number one admitted team mistakes led to him twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The February 9 to May 4 suspension means Sinner will be free to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sinner said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accepted that he "had no intent and did not derive any competitive advantage from the two positive tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Open champion Sinner has always said that clostebol entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis, I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wada said separately that "Sinner did not intend to cheat" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement between Sinner and Wada means that Sinner will be able to play in front of his home fans at the Rome Open which kicks off just after the end of his suspension and is the last big clay court tournament before Roland Garros. (AFP)

    Under-fire Guardiola mocks Liverpool

<img alt="Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola says Liverpool's point tally falls short of the champions' record. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791728_1_20250215090255.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola has taunted Premier League leaders Liverpool over their failure to match Manchester City's record 100-point tally.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's troubled side are trailing 16 points behind Liverpool after their bid for a fifth successive English crown collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal as they chase a 20th title, which would equal Manchester United's record.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if Arne Slot's men go on to secure the trophy, they now cannot match the record points total set when City won the first of Guardiola's six titles in 2017-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of City's faltering performance after Tuesday's 3-2 home defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off round first leg, Guardiola took a swipe at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We took all the records in England. Who would do 100 points now in modern football? I'm waiting," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or four in a row? I'm waiting - with clubs like Bournemouth, Fulham and Wolves that you have to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The standards, we dictated. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already - 99 but not 100."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Liverpool may not surpass fifth-placed City's record mark, Guardiola accepts his team have fallen behind their rivals this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I asked 'Gundo' (Ilkay Gundogan) yesterday, 'two years ago you were here, you were one year in Barcelona and you come back here, did you see changes in the Premier League?'," said Guardiola, whose team host top four rivals Newcastle on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He said massively, the difference was unbelievable. It's the truth. The teams are much, much, much better in all departments. People prepare so well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot do it for the (injury) problems we've had. There are a lot of players, with the amount of minutes they have had, who are so tired, emotionally as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But guys, we deserve to have a bad season. We deserve not to be like we were. They are human beings, it can happen. We weren't consistent and we haven't had the players at their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that me and many of the players have lived this position but we have to accept it (and recognise) what happened in the past was not normal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola believes the difference from previous successful seasons is that City are no longer making the most of their dominance of possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept when the opponents have the ball, I'm going to suffer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now we are suffering when we have the ball. It never happened before and, (right) now, I cannot change it. We are suffering because we are human beings." (AFP)

 Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won 3-0 at home to Anderlecht in the first leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off tie, while Real Sociedad triumphed 2-1 away to Midtjylland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Premier League duo Dusan Tadic and Edin Dzeko scored in the first half for Fenerbahce before Morocco international Youssef En-Nesyri headed in a third for the Turkish side to give them full control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho won the competition with Porto in 2003 and again with Manchester United in 2017, also reaching the final when he was in charge of Roma two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad will return to Spain in a commanding position after a penalty from Brais Mendez and terrific goal by Japan winger Takefusa Kubo saw them past Danish Midtjylland, who pulled one back through Adam Buksa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the tie will play United or Tottenham in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ajax took charge of their play-off against Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise with a 2-0 victory in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Rasmussen steered the Dutch club ahead just before the hour, with 16-year-old Jorthy Mokio volleying in a second from 20 yards.

  Meanwhile, in the Conference League, Irish side Shamrock Rovers secured a 1-0 win away to Norwegians Molde.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

    Shenzhen Bay Port to close for cross-border marathon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kane was on target as Bayern Munich beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, while there were also wins for Benfica, Feyenoord and Club Brugge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are hoping to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their own Allianz Arena in Munich on May 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  They threatened to run riot against the Scottish champions at Celtic Park as they dominated the first half and took the lead just before the interval thanks to a superb Michael Olise strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's second goal came just four minutes after half-time, with the unmarked Kane scoring with a cushioned finish at the back post following a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Kane's seventh goal in this season's Champions League, and his 29th in 29 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Bundesliga leaders took their foot off the pedal after that, allowing Celtic – who had a first-minute Nicolas Kuehn goal disallowed for offside – to come back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brendan Rodgers' team pulled one back as Daizen Maeda scored following a corner with 11 minutes left, but they could not find an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's cliche to say, but it's the first half of the game. Overall, it's a really great result," said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany, according to the BBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic's first home defeat since December 2023 leaves them facing a huge task to try to turn the tie around in Germany next Tuesday, with the winners going through to face either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility," insisted Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Vangelis Pavlidis scored the only goal as Benfica won 1-0 away to Monaco, as the home side were forced to play much of the second half with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica had won 3-2 in Monaco in the league phase in November and they came out on top again at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Pavlidis strike just after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Greek international's sixth goal in his team's last five Champions League outings, a run which includes a hat-trick in the dramatic 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool in a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure, Curtis Jones and Slot were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Virgil van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since David Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton then suffered a huge blow as their creative hub Iliman Ndiaye limped off in tears after a long stoppage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first half never recovered its flow amid a flurry of fouls and yellow cards as the Premier League fixture with the most red cards in history threatened to boil over once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton started the better once more in the second period. Doucoure wasted a great chance to retake the lead when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home crowd briefly erupted once more when Branthwaite fired home only for the celebrations to be cut short by the offside flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was growing visibly frustrated with his side's lack of penetration going forward and turned to his bench for an impact with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jones and Darwin Núñez sent on to find a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes worked as Salah delivered what looked like a potential title-clinching moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Núñez exchanged a one-two and when the midfielder's shot was blocked by Branthwaite, it fell kindly for Salah to prod in his 27th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant save by Jordan Pickford crucially denied Salah a second late on. And Everton rallied when Liverpool failed to deal with a hopeful ball into the box and it fell to centre-back Tarkowski to fire into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy VAR check followed for offside and Everton fans had to be cleared off the pitch before the game could restart.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it did there was more fireworks as Doucoure and Jones were both shown a second yellow card for clashing after the Everton midfielder celebrated in front of the travelling Liverpool support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was also shown red for his protests towards referee Michael Oliver. (AFP)

    Arsenal's Havertz out for season with torn hamstring

<img alt="Havertz's injury is the latest blow to Arsenal's Premier League and European ambitions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791406_1_20250213060238.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's bid to win the Premier League could suffer a major setback following reports Kai Havertz is set to be ruled out for the remainder of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German forward sustained an injury during the club's warm-weather training camp in Dubai and was due to face further tests on the club's arrival back in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported on Wednesday the 25-year-old Havertz had suffered a torn hamstring and could now miss the rest of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, however, have yet to comment on the extent of Havertz's injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His potential long-term absence would though compound the problems confronting Gunners boss Mikel Arteta after Arsenal were unable to bolster their attack during the recent January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London club failed in an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz was set to lead Arsenal's line for the rest of the season, with Arteta even saying it was possible the Germany international would have to play every game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus is already out for the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month, whle Bukayo Saka has been absent since December, although there are hopes the England international could return next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, is also sidelined after he was forced off injured during Arsenal's League Cup semi-final second-leg semi-final defeat at Newcastle last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  All these absences leave the Gunners with only three recognised forward players in Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta may well speak about Havertz – who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances this season – on Friday when he holds a pre-match press conference to preview the Gunners' league game away to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are presently second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool but having played a game more, as they attempt to become champions of England for the first time in 21 years. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.
