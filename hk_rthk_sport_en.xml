<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City collapsed to their fifth straight defeat on Saturday, hammered 4-0 by Tottenham in another huge blow to their Premier League title hopes as Arsenal got their challenge back on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rout at the Etihad ends City's 52-game unbeaten home run and leaves manager Pep Guardiola scrambling for answers just two days after he signed a contract extension with the club he has guided to four consecutive league titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the start of the match, City staged a spectacular tribute to the injured Rodri, who showcased the Ballon d'Or trophy he won last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the feel-good spirit did not last long as Spurs showed the home team how much they are missing the Spain midfielder, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored twice in the opening 20 minutes and Pedro Porro extended Tottenham's lead early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs completed their crushing win in stoppage time when Timo Werner raced down the left, squaring for Brennan Johnson to slide home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In eight years we have never lived this kind of situation," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we have to live it and break it winning the next games, especially the next one. Now we see things in one way, maybe in a few weeks we see it differently."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added: "The fire is when you win a lot of games, which is better than when you are losing, but we accept this. We have to move forward and break it and try."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who have lost their past three Premier League matches and their last five in all competitions, remain five points behind leaders Liverpool, who play their game in hand against Southampton on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time defending Premier League champions travel to Anfield next weekend, where defeat would leave their title hopes in tatters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are now in sixth spot, said he was proud of his side, admitting said it was possible to become "spooked" against City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They test you in every way - mentally, physically, tactically," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal earlier crushed Nottingham Forest 3-0 to pull level on 22 points with third-placed Chelsea, who saw off Leicester in the early kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's Gunners were expected to be contenders for City's crown after finishing second in each of the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they had failed to win in their previous four league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard's return from a long injury lay-off is a major boost for Arsenal and he teed up Bukayo Saka to blast home the opener on 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka turned provider for another special strike, this time by Thomas Partey early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenager Ethan Nwaneri then came off the bench to score his first Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking about Odegaard, who returned to action at Inter Milan earlier this month, Arteta said: "It's not a coincidence. The team flows in a different way when he is playing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea remain ahead of Arsenal on goals scored after a 2-1 win on manager Enzo Maresca's return to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson scored the opener but Chelsea struggled to make their dominance count until Enzo Fernandez headed home, before a late consolation goal from the penalty spot for Jordan Ayew.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa are now winless in six games in all competition and had to twice come from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's incredible start under 31-year-old boss Fabian Hurzeler continued with a 2-1 win at Bournemouth to climb to fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are out of the bottom three thanks to a stunning 4-1 win at Fulham, with Matheus Cunha scoring twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton failed to take advantage of an early red card for Brentford's Christian Norgaard in a 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.

    Springboks crush hapless Wales 54-12

<img alt="South Africa's Aphelele Fassi crashes over for the Springboks' fifth try against Wales. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780579_1_20241124073302.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World champions South Africa hammered Wales 45-12 in Cardiff on Saturday to condemn Warren Gatland's team to a 12th consecutive Test defeat and a winless calendar year for the first time since 1937.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Springboks were dominant throughout at the Principality Stadium, scoring seven tries to two in a relentless display that matched attacking accuracy with defensive brutality and set-piece mastery.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result meant the Boks, who wrapped up the Rugby Championship title this year, finish their season with 11 victories from 13 Tests, having used a whopping 52 players and scoring 57 tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first two games we weren't happy, there was so much we could have done better," Springbok captain Siya Kolisi told TNT Sports of opening November victories over Scotland and England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Results are important but it's how you do things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the first time South Africa have won all their matches on their November tour since 2013 and means they will see in 2025 as World Rugby's number one ranked country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boks' sole losses were one-point defeats by Argentina and Ireland, a record of which Gatland and his backroom staff could only dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales' last victory came over pool opponents Georgia in October 2023 at the Rugby World Cup, with Gatland having to blood a raft of inexperienced players after a host of seniors hung up their boots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pre-match entertainment included choirs singing "Yma O Hyd", the Dafydd Iwan folk song that has become the go-to song for Welsh football's "Red Wall" support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, it translates into English as "Still Here", albeit in reference to Wales and the Welsh language and not Gatland per se.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Welsh Rugby Union has its AGM on Sunday where discussions are expected on the New Zealander's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You don't make a decision straight after a game," said Gatland. "Let's just see what happens over the next few days."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wales captain Dewi Lake told TNT Sports his side had showed "a lot of heart and character".
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are double world champions, that's not for no reason," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to keep the faith, the second we lose our faith in ourselves then it's pointless us stepping on the field, we can definitely see a light at the end of the tunnel."
  <br>
  <br>
  The scene was set within the opening eight frantic minutes in the Welsh capital as the visiting lock pair of Franco Mostert and Eben Etzebeth each crossed for a try after deft attacking lead-up play by Kurt-Lee Arendse on both occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kolisi was held up over the line by James Botham, but the Boks fired back to the Welsh line and Arendse got his just rewards for his strong start, stepping inside Blair Murray's attempted tackle with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Hendrikse converted two of the three tries to make it 19-0 after the opening quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray did well to hold up Aphelele Fassi over the line and Kolisi had a try disallowed, but the toll on Wales was beginning to show.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long could their defence hold out? Not long as the Boks promptly pushed Wales off their own ball at scrum time and flanker Elrigh Louw barged over for the visitors' fourth five-pointer after a quick tap penalty by Jasper Wiese.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rare Welsh incursion into the opposition half saw the home side, wearing white to avoid a colour-blindness clash with the green of South Africa, go for an attacking line-out, but the Boks repelled two 12-man mauls.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ball was eventually moved wide and Welsh winger Rio Dyer showed a brilliant flash of raw pace to scorch the defence for a fine individual try. Sam Costelow missed the conversion to leave the score 26-5 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fassi crossed for South Africa's fifth try after the outstanding Arendse split the Welsh line early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A raft of replacements for both sides gave Wales a degree of respite, but it was not long before Gerhard Steenkamp was driven over from short range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things turned scrappy and the 67,236-strong crowd turned attention away from the action and Welsh hymns to foot-stomping Mexican waves, always a sure sign the game was well and over as a contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hendrikse crossed for the Boks' seventh try and converted for a personal game tally of 15 points before a Botham consolation try converted by Ben Thomas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other Test action, New Zealand saw off Italy 29-11 in their final match of the year as Sam Cane was given a winning farewell to international rugby in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Roigard, Will Jordan, Mark Tele'a and Beauden Barrett scored the tries as the All Blacks beat Italy for the 18th consecutive time, with fly-half Barrett kicking the rest visitors' points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cane closed out his Test career with 104 caps, and T-J Perenara also played his final All Blacks match as a second half substitute. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was an historic day for American Patrick Reed at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling on Saturday, as he shot a rare round of 59 to catapult himself into a three-stroke lead at the end of day three.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 2018 winner at Augusta carded 11 birdies in his sizzling 11-under-par third round to go 18-under overall on the prestigious Asian Tour event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old's milestone is the lowest score ever in the tournament and overtakes a 60 scored by Britain's Ian Poulter in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had probably one of my worst warm-ups ever," Reed, 34, who is among a number of big-name players to have jumped ship to the Saudi-backed Liv Golf circuit, told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I looked at my caddie and he said, 'Hey, a warm-up's a warm-up. Let's go out and just play golf. Some of your best rounds have come from a poor warm-up.'"
  <br>
  <br>
  The American started with a blistering five birdies in a row and rattled off four more on the trot to finish with a flurry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I honestly felt it could have been lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Going into the final round in Fanling, Reed holds a three-shot lead over India's Rashid Khan and Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand as he chases a first win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand is a further shot back at 14-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong golfing sensation Taichi Kho shot a four-under-par 66 for round three to go 12-under overall, as the tournament gears up for its final round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho, along with six other players, ended the afternoon strong to hold on to a tie for sixth place – after a dominant display that saw him grouped with Japan's Kazuki Higa and Kevin Yuan of Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting off with a birdie was great," Kho told reporters. "I capitalised on a good second shot on the sixth [hole], and got away with a good break on thirteenth being behind a tree – but I had a big gap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So being able to hit it on and two from there, and two putting from birdie, definitely helped boost my round quite a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  With the 24-year-old bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open crown, he also noted the challenges he overcame throughout the afternoon under rainier conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A bit of fortune there," Kho said. "There were times where I found myself in the trees, but I managed to find an opening without much concern, which gave me the focus I needed to hit a good shot."
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the 63rd edition of the Hong Kong Open. (AFP/RTHK)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown drains a three-pointer on his way to top-scoring for the Boston Celtics. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780523_1_20241123151736.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown top-scored with 31 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics struggled to a 108-96 win at Washington in the NBA Cup on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics moved to 13-8 on the season but still have some work to do in the NBA Cup, where they are in second place at 2-1 in Eastern Conference Group C behind the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their celebratory trip to the White House on Thursday, the Celtics trailed by two at half-time, having been 11 points behind at one stage, and it wasn't until late in the fourth quarter that they were able to pull away from the Wizards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown delivered down the stretch, his superb turnaround jumper giving Boston a 99-92 lead and ending Washington's resistance.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a vintage Celtics performance though.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum, who scored 16 points, was 0-for-10 from three-point range and Boston shot 42.4 percent from the floor and 23.9 percent from three-point range, equalling their lowest scoring output of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla picked up a technical foul in the second half for remonstrating with the referee but said his emotions had an impact on the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It changed the energy in the arena. Did you feel that? It wasn't really about energising the guys, it was more about manipulating the environment. It was just what the environment needed at the time," said Mazzulla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, without the injured Luka Doncic, survived a strong comeback from the Denver Nuggets to emerge with a 123-120 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naji Marshall top-scored for the Mavs, off the bench, with 26 points, while PJ Washington put up 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic had a triple-double, top-scoring for Denver with 33 points along with 17 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas had a 24-point lead early in the third but Denver battled back and DeAndre Jordan's alley oop dunk shot made it a two-point game with 8:47 left in the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Gafford's two-point shot levelled the game 108-108 with 5:13 remaining and it was nip and tuck all the way down the stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Denver down a point and just four seconds left on the clock, Jamal Murray tried to hit the rim with his second free throw but inadvertently found the basket and two free throws from Washington sealed the win for Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all stepped up at the right time and we gutted out this win," said Mavs point guard Kyrie Irving, who said the team had shown the right attitude without Doncic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is next-man-up mentality and we've got to do our best to find that rhythm. Consistently feed each other that confidence, especially in tough environments like this. We had to will ourselves to this win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Philadelphia 76ers snapped a five-game losing streak with a 113-98 win over the Brooklyn Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jared McCain scored 30 points and Tyrese Maxey 26 as the 76ers coped without the injured Joel Embiid and Paul George.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Johnson top-scored for the Nets with 37 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins scored 30 points for the Golden State Warriors as they won 112-108 at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pair of free throws from Draymond Green saw the Warriors over the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State's win moves them to 12-3 in the regular season and put them into the quarter-finals of the NBA Cup as they sit on a 3-0 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo produced his second triple-double in four games putting up 37 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Indiana Pacers 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard helped out with 24 points and 12 assists as the Bucks claimed their third straight win and went 2-0 in the NBA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary Trent Jr, off the bench, added 18 points for Milwaukee with his 6-of-10 three-point shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's playing with confidence, walks with confidence, works hard," Antetokounmpo said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are the shots he makes in practice and we knew that sooner or later he would make them in games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am happy for him and need him to keep playing with confidence." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 France eased to a 37-23 victory over an ill-disciplined Argentina at a bitterly cold Paris in their final game of the November internationals on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus claimed four tries including a superb solo effort from in-form winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey, following on from victories over Japan and New Zealand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three from three during the series makes us happy, it was the objective," Bielle-Biarrey told TF1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan was a little warm-up, then against the All Blacks we fought until the end. We end with three wins and I feel we improved game on game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Pumas had two players shown yellow cards in the first half, captain Julian Montoya and Juan Martin Gonzalez, which led to the hosts leading 30-9 at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't start the way we wanted, our discipline wasn't good," Montoya told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What made me proud was we went again until the 80th minute, there's things to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  France coach Fabien Galthie made four changes from last Saturday's nerve-wracking one-point win over New Zealand as Charles Ollivon came in for the dropped Gregory Alldritt at No 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina boss Felipe Contepomi switched his scrum-half giving Gonzalo Garcia a start instead of Gonzalo Bertranou after last Friday's loss to Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the All Blacks, Les Bleus lost prop Tevita Tatafu to an early injury and loose-head Jean-Baptiste Gros suffered a similar fate after four minutes on Friday with a leg problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gros's injury was caused by Montoya's dangerous clean at a ruck and the hooker was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie's side made the extra man count to open the scoring as Antoine Dupont fed lock Thibaud Flament to crash over from short range after a powerful rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Ramos slotted the easy conversion to make it 7-0 after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the half hour mark the hosts lead 13-9 as Ramos traded penalty goals with Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz.
  <br>
  <br>
  France stretched their advantage to 20-9 as winger Gabin Villiere dived over following some dominant forward carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos added the conversion to overtake Dimitri Yachvili in third place on France's scoring charts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things worsened for Contepomi's outfit as they conceded a penalty try with four minutes of the first half to play and had a second player sent to the bin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flanker Gonzalez was shown a yellow card for palming a loose ball into touch after Dupont and Ramos showed their class with delicate chip kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  France went into the break 30-9 ahead as Ramos slotted his third penalty of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the interval Galthie brought 20-year-old back-rower Marko Gazzotti on for his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flanker's main intervention was to scramble onto a loose ball three metres from his own line before Les Bleus cleared with Argentina working their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 24 minutes to play they were rewarded as prop Thomas Gallo benefitted from a rolling maul and Albornoz brought the score to 30-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas' comeback hopes were shortlived as Bielle-Biarrey scored his fourth try in three games, showing lightning speed to gather his own grubber kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos converted to make it 37-16 leaving the south Americans, fourth at last year's World Cup, with a mountain to climb in the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deficit was cut once again as Perpignan hooker Ignacio Ruiz, one of 10 French-based players in Argentina's matchday squad, barrelled over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz took the score to 37-23 with his two-pointer with nine minutes to play but it wasn't enough to claim a first win over France in Paris since 2014. (AFP)

    Vegas disaster for Verstappen as team bring wrong wing

<img alt="Senior adviser Helmut Marko says Red Bull are losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight because of the blunder. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780438_1_20241122193419.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen's hopes of clinching a fourth consecutive drivers' world championship at the Las Vegas Grand Prix this weekend took a dent on Friday when Red Bull revealed they had brought the wrong rear wing.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with Auto Motor und Sport, the team's senior advisor Helmut Marko said Red Bull were losing up to six-tenths of a second on the main straight, the Las Vegas Boulevard leading to Caesars Palace, after a packing blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have another rear wing, a smaller rear wing, as we see on our competitors," said Marko. "It would be more helpful, for sure."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it was too late for the team to arrange for a more appropriate trimmed rear wing to be flown out to Las Vegas before the race on Saturday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen leads McLaren's Lando Norris by 62 points with three races remaining and simply needs to finish ahead of him in Las Vegas to become the sixth man to win four world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, however, struggled in second practice on Thursday night, finishing 17th in slippery conditions on the cold, dry and dusty circuit around the streets of 'Sin City' where the three-time champion won last year's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen tried to make light of the team's error, in packing the wrong rear wing, and blamed his struggle on the slippery conditions and difficulty with tyre temperatures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The issue for us is definitely tyre-related as we have no grip and it feels like driving on ice," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We struggled to make the tyres work, especially over one lap and we were quite far off with the pace."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team-mate Sergio Perez was 19th in the session topped by Mercedes' seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton ahead of Norris of McLaren, who said on Wednesday it is "probably too late" to stop Verstappen from taking the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were flashes of speed," said Marko. "We just have to get consistency into it. On the single lap we can improve but on the long run, the tyre wear is a problem at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that conditions may change in favour of Red Bull before the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow is a different day," he said. "You see it a lot of times. People will be fastest on Friday, or Thursday, but it doesn't mean that they are fast in the race. We will, for sure, make a reasonable step." (AFP)

<img alt="Ben Campbell leads the pack at the end of round two of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780434_1_20241122190618.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand golfer Ben Campbell on Friday shot a five-under 65 to surge to the top of the leaderboard at the Hong Kong Open, putting the defending champion one shot ahead of Thailand's Nitithorn Thippong as the competition entered the halfway mark.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a dominant display for Campbell, 33, who took advantage of his familiarity with the course in Fanling to outperform his group comprising South Korean phenom Tom Kim and American Peter Uihlein under sunny and bright conditions, a far-cry from Thursday's wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell had a two-day total of 12-under 128, overtaking opening round leader Nitithorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three others – Australian Kevin Yuan, Kazuki Higa of Japan and Yongjun Bae of South Korea, who had the day's best score of 62 – were tied for third at 9-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local sensation Taichi Kho moved up the leaderboard in his bid to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China star had another solid outing with a round of five-under 65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho and four others were tied for sixth at eight under at the end of round two, four shots behind Campbell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim and Uihlein, meanwhile, were among those missing the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today gave me a lot of confidence and proved what I was doing was working," Campbell told reporters after his strong performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think being out on LIV as a reserve this year really helped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Being around some of the best players in the world, seeing what they do, allowed me to back up the things I've learned from the team around me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Campbell also spoke about what it meant to be competing in the SAR again, as he looks to defend his title and add a second Asian Tour title to his resume.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've found a swing that my body seems to like a lot more," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning here last year was massive. It's always nice to come back to a golf course you really like and feel comfortable on, so it's definitely great to be back here again."

    Super Sixes to be held next month

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Sixes, a lacrosse tournament, will be held in Hong Kong for the second time in December, with local players seeing it as an opportunity to train themselves up for the 2028 Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Super Sixes will be held from December 13 to 15 at the Wong Chuk Hang Recreation Ground and the Aberdeen Sports Ground, featuring five men’s and five women’s teams, from countries including China, Japan, Germany and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association, said the tournament will allow the SAR’s players to gain practical experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong is very small. It's not like China, it's not like Japan. Without all these tournaments, all they can do is just play among their own players in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They are already top in Hong Kong, so they’re really not challenging themselves too much. This tournament would be basically bringing the overseas teams to challenge them.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The lacrosse sixes is a new and faster-paced version of the sport, and it will be added to the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leader of the men’s team, Wing Cheung, said they will be using different strategies from last year, and he is confident they will perform better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This year, we focus more on conditioning because last year it showed that the sixes format requires lots of running,” Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have been playing box lacrosse in this summer, and it helps with our stick skills and overall skills, so I think this year may be a good year for us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse player Samuel Chow said the competition will be an opportunity for them to learn more about the other teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The sixes tournament will be a very important step for us to see how we’re going to perform in the international stage in this new format, and we’re going to see how we might be able to compete into the 2028 Olympics,” he said.

    Ohtani, Judge win 2024 MLB MVP awards

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani won his third Most Valuable Player Award and first in the National League, and Aaron Judge earned his second American League honour on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, 30, was a unanimous MVP for the third time, receiving all 30 first-place votes and 420 points in voting by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor was second with 263 points, and Arizona second baseman Ketel Marte third with 229.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge was a unanimous pick for the first time. Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. got all 30 second-place votes for 270 points, and Yankees outfielder Juan Soto was third with 21 third-place votes and 229 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge had discussed the MVP award with Philadelphia’s Bryce Harper, the NL winner in 2015 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was telling him, `Man, I’m going to try to catch up to you with these MVP's here, man,’” Judge recalled. “He’d say, hopefully, he could stay a couple ahead of me – which I think he’ll do.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani was unanimously voted the AL MVP in 2021 and 2023 as a two-way star for the Los Angeles Angels and finished second to Judge in 2022 voting. He didn’t pitch in 2024 following elbow surgery and signed a record US$700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers last December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was the first player to twice become an unanimous MVP. He combined with Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. in 2023 for the first year both MVP's were unanimous.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit .310, stole 59 bases and led the NL with 54 homers and 130 RBIs exclusively as a designated hitter, becoming the first player with 50 or more homers and 50 or more stolen bases in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He helped the Dodgers to the World Series title, playing the final three games with a torn labrum in his left shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani became the first primary designated hitter to win an MVP. He joined Frank Robinson for Cincinnati in 1961 and Baltimore in 1966 as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is the 12th player with three or more MVPs, joining Barry Bonds with seven and Jimmie Foxx, Joe DiMaggio, Stan Musial, Roy Campanella, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Mike Schmidt, Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols and Mike Trout with three each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Balloting was conducted before the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge led the major leagues with 58 homers, 144 RBIs and 133 walks while hitting .322. Witt topped the big leagues with a .332 average, hitting 32 homers with 31 stolen bases and 109 RBIs. Soto batted .288 with 41 homers and 109 RBIs. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull Italy SailGP Team was on Thursday unveiled as the 12th and final entry for the 2025 SailGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Led by Jimmy Spithill, who serves as the team's CEO and founder, the team will make its debut this weekend at the Emirates Dubai Sail Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian lineup includes double Olympic gold medallist Ruggero Tita as driver and twice world bronze medallist Giulia Fava as strategist.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joining the team are three-time SailGP champion Kyle Langford, who made a surprise move from Australia, and grinders Matteo Celon and Enrico Voltolini, both veterans of America’s Cup racing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s debut comes after Spithill announced plans to form an Italian team following his departure from the US SailGP Team last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy is one of two new entries in the global league this season, alongside the Mubadala Brazil SailGP Team.
  <br>
  <br>
  SailGP is an international sailing competition featuring high-speed races in identical F50 foiling catamarans, capable of reaching speeds exceeding 100 km/h.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league pits national teams against each other in a series of regattas held across iconic locations worldwide. (Reuters)

<img alt="Italy's Jannik Sinner and Matteo Berrettini after the win. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780327_1_20241122080813.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Jannik Sinner triumphed in singles and doubles to help Davis Cup holders Italy beat Argentina 2-1 on Thursday to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italy will face Australia after they earlier defeated record 32-time winners the United States with a tense 2-1 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner won his first two Grand Slams this season, as well as triumphing at the ATP Finals last week without dropping a set, and blew Sebastian Baez away 6-2, 6-1 after Francisco Cerundolo comfortably beat Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-1 in the opening rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decisive doubles battle, Sinner and Matteo Berrettini shaded Andres Molteni and Maximo Gonzalez 6-4, 7-5 to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they put me on the court in doubles I try my best," said Sinner. "Matteo played unbelievable today, he carried me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy booked a third consecutive return to the semi-finals and are favourites to win the Davis Cup for a second year running, in no small part because of Sinner's presence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old is still waiting for the outcome of the World Anti-Doping Agency's appeal against his initial exoneration for twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner beat Novak Djokovic in singles and doubles in last year's semi-finals on the way to helping Italy end a 47-year wait to lift the trophy again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't have time to adapt to this court after the ATP Finals, so I'm very happy with how I handled the situation today," Sinner told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very good doubles pairing, he played unbelievable," he added. "I tried to stay there with Berrettini, he also gave me a lot of confidence to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  The doubles teams were tied until the ninth game of the first set when Sinner won three points and then Molteni clipped his passing shot which was heading wide to hand Italy the decisive solitary break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set was even tighter with Italy breaking for a 6-5 lead and sealing their victory with a Sinner smash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini more than held his own alongside Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're playing with Jannik the pressure is off a little bit, he's going to play great," said the world number 35.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina's captain Guillermo Coria said he was pleased with his team taking Italy to the wire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It speaks of the respect Italy have for us, and my doubles pairing, that they put the world number one out there," he said. "We were close to taking out a powerful team like Italy." (AFP)

<img alt="Taichi Kho says he got off to a slow start before playing better on day one of the Hong Kong Open. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780280_1_20241121190146.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local golfing sensation Taichi Kho said he had a "solid day" at the office as he shot a three-under 67 in the opening round of the Hong Kong Open in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  That put the Hong Kong, China star tied for 20th place, five shots off the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitithorn Thippong of Thailand led the pack at the end of day one with a sizzling round of eight-under 62.
  <br>
  <br>
  Appearing in his second Hong Kong Open, the 24-year-old Kho braved the rainy and windy conditions and teed off in a group comprising 2015 champion Justin Rose and American Patrick Reed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought it was a solid day overall," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Got off to a bit of a slow start, but I feel like Patrick [Reed] and Justin [Rose] were very encouraging of me to play well out there today, which allowed me to feed off of their energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learned a lot from how they played, which helped me get my momentum going midway through the round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the putts didn't quite drop, I still felt like I played well towards the end and did a lot of good things out there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kho is bidding to become the first player from the SAR to capture the Hong Kong Open after his historic victory at the World City Championship last year made him the first Hong Kong player to win on the Asian Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Ben Campbell of New Zealand, along with Australian Kevin Yuan and Kazuki Higa of Japan, were a shot behind Nitithorn at seven under 63, tied for second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the other top finishers from the SAR, Jason Hak had a round of 66 and Michael Wong, like Kho, shot a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Kho, the Hong Kong Open serves as a test match for the 2025 National Games, where he is set to compete in the event co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely want to represent Hong Kong, China," Kho said, as he weighed in on the opportunity to compete for the SAR on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This course has stood the test of time. It's one of the best ones we play out on tour, making it a great venue for the upcoming Games."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid eased into the Uefa Women's Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday with a 3-2 win over Dutch side FC Twente, while Chelsea also booked their places in the knockout phase with a win over Celtic en route to their third consecutive victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch hosts led through Jaimy Ravensbergen's opener, but Linda Caicedo levelled on the stroke of half-time before Madrid took control with goals from Signe Bruun and substitute Alba Redondo, who scored in added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twente pulled a goal back right at the end courtesy of Sophie te Brake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid are second on nine points but cannot be overtaken by Twente after winning both meetings between the teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can see Real Madrid going really far in this Women's Champions League campaign," said Danish forward Bruun.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has always been my dream to win trophies," she added. "This one might be the biggest, so again, we're one step closer."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, joining Real in the quarter-finals from the same section will be Chelsea – after they came away with a convincing 3-0 victory over Scottish club Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  England international Lucy Bronze struck with a volley in the second minute at Stamford Bridge, and Dutch midfielder Wieke Kaptein's header doubled Chelsea's lead midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eve Perisset added a third from the penalty spot in second-half stoppage time, as Women's Super League leaders Chelsea made it four wins from four in Group B to guarantee their passage to the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A great result. Really happy with the win, the three points, we are top of the table. It was really important to score the first goal especially really early in the game," Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We scored three goals, clean sheet, so a perfect night again," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have won all 11 games under Bompastor, who moved to London in May after three years in charge of Lyon. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LPGA golfers will compete for a record US$131 million in prize money over a 33-event season in 2025, the tour's 75th anniversary campaign, LPGA officials announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the eve of the season-ending Tour Championship at Naples, Florida, next year's schedule was unveiled, including two new tournaments and two unofficial events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total prize money will have jumped US$62 million in four years, next season's payout jumping 90 percent from the pandemic-hit 2021 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 season was another year of historic growth for the LPGA Tour, and with this 2025 schedule we will continue to improve on that growth," LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA's global schedule will begin two weeks later than this year and see competition in the United States and 11 other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The season-opening LPGA Tournament of Champions in Orlando on January 30-February 2 will be followed the next week by the Founders Cup at Bradenton before the tour heads for Asia in February and March for events in Thailand, Singapore and China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA Match Play will be contested April 2 to 6 in Las Vegas ahead of the year's first women's major, the Chevron Championship at The Woodlands, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  May will feature two new LPGA events, the Black Desert Championship in Ivins, Utah on May 1 to 4 and the first LPGA event in Mexico since 2017, the Riviera Maya Open in Cancun on May 22 to 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second major, the US Women's Open, will be contested May 29 to June 1 at Erin Hills in Wisconsin, followed by the Women's PGA Championship on June 19 to 22 at PGA Frisco in Frisco, Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The year's final majors will be the Evian Championship in France on July 10-13 and the Women's British Open on July 31 to August 3 at Royal Porthcawl in Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The LPGA returns to North America until a late-season Asia swing with events in October at Shanghai, South Korea and Malaysia and a November stop in Japan before two final events, the Annika on November 13 to 16 and the 2025 season-ending Tour Championship in Naples on November 20 to 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean tournaments will include the biennial International Crown team event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FM Championship in Boston on August 28 to 31 will have a US$4.1 million purse, the first event to crack US$4 million in prize money outside of the majors and Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, nine tournaments will have elevated purses from 2024. (AFP)

<img alt="Italy celebrating after winning the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780161_1_20241121055027.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup for the fifth time as Jasmine Paolini beat Rebecca Sramkova to secure a dominant 2-0 win over Slovakia on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number four Paolini triumphed 6-2, 6-1 in the second singles rubber to follow up Lucia Bronzetti's 6-2, 6-4 victory against Viktoria Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy were runners-up to Canada in last year's final but went one better in Malaga to become world champions for the first time since 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory capped a stunning year for Paolini who finished as runner-up at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable year, unbelievable, to finish like this with the Billie Jean King cup, it's amazing, I don't have words to describe it," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trying just to enjoy it, it's important to understand where you are, I feel lucky to be in this position – I feel lucky to be part of this team," she added. "I'm really happy that this year we could bring the trophy home again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, who won the competition in 2002, had never lost a BJK Cup tie in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underdogs defeated USA, Australia and Great Britain on a stunning run to this year's final, but Bronzetti breezed past Hruncakova in under 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Sramkova, ranked 43rd, survived two break points to hold for 2-2 in the first set but the superior Paolini broke for a 4-2 lead, which she consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian double faulted to hand Paolini two set points and the Italian took the first of them when Sramkova slapped a shot into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini broke in the second game of the second set and it looked like she might power to victory without a fight, but Sramkova immediately hit back to get back on serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova defeated Danielle Collins, Ajla Tomljanovic and Katie Boulter on Slovakia's charge to the final but Paolini was a bridge too far.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Italian restored her advantage with a fizzing forehand to move 3-1 ahead and then consolidated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having spent most of her career outside the top 50, 2024 has been a huge leap forward for Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  She broke again when Sramkova went long and served it out to seal an emphatic victory in one hour and five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel so sad now, disappointed, but all respect to Italy, for what they did," a deflated Sramkova told reporters. "Maybe in a few days we will enjoy that we are second, and take something for the future from those matches." (AFP)

    Sports bodies that don't improve face subsidy cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China on Wednesday said member associations that fail to meet new standards in terms of governance and operation may face penalties such as subsidy cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The body launched a review of the governance and operation of 77 sports associations following a 2020 audit report. It said the review has now been completed and it will hand in a report to the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edgar Yang, honorary secretary general of the SF&OC, said associations will be given two years to make improvements set out in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consequences for failing to do so will include cuts to government subsidies, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That will be the worst scenario, that we have to step in. In the coming 24 months, we believe that we will be able to lead and offer guidance to the NSAs (national sports associations) where we see there are matters that we need to rectify or enhance,” Yang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The certificate of compliance will be the last resort. Basically, there will be [different] levels of punishment that we will consider.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung attended a briefing for associations conducted by the SF&OC on Wednesday and said the review marks the start of improvements for the sports sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a very important step forward for the further enhancement of our whole sports development in the future. We are positive and we will work with the SF&OC and all the NSAs to make sure that we are all going towards the right direction,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Member associations of the SF&OC expressed support for the report, with chairman of the Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association, Sherman Chan, saying it is reasonable for those who fail to comply with the requirements to be hit with penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think this is quite fair. If any of the NSAs could not meet the requirements, nor try to improve, and their [subsidies] were cut, I think that’s fair,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report covers areas such as the associations’ board governance, selection of athletes, and management of coaches and umpires.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jayson Tatum scored 33 points as the Boston Celtics ended the Cleveland Cavaliers' 15-game unbeaten start to the season with a hard-fought 120-117 victory in the NBA Cup on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics unleashed a barrage of 22 three-pointers to overwhelm Cleveland, who clawed their way back to within two points of the lead late in the game after trailing by 21 early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite the Cleveland fightback, reigning NBA champions Boston held their nerve and kept the scoreboard ticking over to close out a deserved win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 33 points included six three-pointers while the Boston star added 12 rebounds and seven assists in an all-round Celtics effort that saw six players finish in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum said Boston's championship pedigree had helped the Celtics over the line as Cleveland threatened late in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of basketball, we've played in the biggest games," Tatum said. "NBA is a bunch of talented teams – guys are gonna make plays, they're gonna make shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I say it all the time – how you respond shows your growth and how special your team is," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum admitted that ending Cleveland's unbeaten record, which has left them sitting on top of the Eastern Conference, had motivated the Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They came in 15-0 feeling like they were the best team; we felt like we were the best team – it's all competition. We were ready to play today," Tatum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston were quickly into their stride, rattling in five early three-pointers to sprint into an 18-8 in the opening minutes of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland rallied to reduce the deficit to 26-20 at the end of the first quarter, but the Celtics kept up the pressure in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum drained a superb three-pointer in the final seconds of the first half to give Boston a commanding 65-48 lead at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics stretched into a 21-point lead early in the second half, but the Cavaliers clicked into gear and came roaring back to close the gap to two points at 88-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum though had the last word, nailing an imperious three-pointer to give Boston a five-point lead heading into the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A nip-and-tuck final period saw Cleveland repeatedly close to two points but Boston pulled clear in the final minutes to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell led Cleveland's scoring with 35 points while Evan Mobley added 22 with 11 rebounds and six assists. (AFP)

 Slovakia swept past Britain in the Billie Jean King Cup semi-final doubles decider on Tuesday to seal a 2-1 victory and set up a title showdown with Italy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Tereza Mihalikova saw off British duo Olivia Nicholls and Heather Watson 6-2, 6-2 in the decisive rubber. Slovakia, the 2002 winners, face last year's runners-up Italy in Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I cried like a baby but now I'm very calm and ready for tomorrow," said an emotional Mihalikova. "We need one more win, then we can touch the trophy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia are into their second final having lifted the trophy the last time against Spain in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Jasmine Paolini's Italy reached a second consecutive BJK Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland. Four-time winners Italy last lifted the women's team trophy in 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu, who won the US Open in 2021, won the opening singles tie 6-4, 6-4 against Hruncakova to keep four-time runners-up Britain's hopes of a first final in 43 years alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rebecca Sramkova's comeback from a set down to beat British number one Katie Boulter 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 forced a decisive doubles rubber which Slovakia dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are just enjoying every match, we have got nothing to lose, we're just trying to do our best," said Stramkova. "I don't think the (doubles) girls have the pressure, I don't have the pressure either, because we're underdogs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu opened the first set with a break against Hruncakova, ranked 238th in the world, 180 places beneath her.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton led 5-2 with another break in the fifth game before Hruncakova found her footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovakian saved a set point, breaking back for 5-3 and then consolidating as Raducanu wobbled but then closed out comfortably on her serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sidelined with a foot injury since mid-September until this week, the 22-year-old at times struggled with her opponent's power but was otherwise superior. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Superstar Rafael Nadal's glittering career in professional tennis came to an end on Tuesday as the Netherlands eliminated Spain in the Davis Cup quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Spaniard, a 22-time Grand Slam winner, was defeated in the first singles rubber and after Carlos Alcaraz won the second match to send the tie to a doubles decider, the Dutch triumphed to snatch a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal was beaten 6-4, 6-4 by Botic van de Zandschulp in the opening singles clash, before Alcaraz defeated Tallon Griekspoor 7-6 (7/0), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the deciding doubles rubber, Van de Zandschulp and Wesley Koolhof secured a 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/3) victory to set up a semi-final clash with Canada or Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  After years ravaged by injuries and not having played an official singles match since July, doubts hung over Nadal's involvement in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were resolved when captain David Ferrer confirmed he would play in the first singles rubber of the opening finals clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal appeared emotional during the Spanish national anthem, and over 10,000 fans filled the arena with chants of "Rafa, Rafa," when it ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was having an emotional day, nerves before what could be my last singles match as a professional," said Nadal. "The emotions hearing the national anthem for the last time as a professional were very special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nadal had won his last 29 Davis Cup singles matches out of 30 played after debuting in the tournament in 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite giving every ounce of his energy in the second set and buoyed by immense home support, Nadal fell short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the beginning I think we were both nervous – the crowd was tough, understandably," said Van de Zandschulp. "That is what it is to play against Rafa in Spain – he is probably the biggest sportsman here in Spain that ever lived."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given his diminished physical condition Nadal, ranked 154th in the world, attempted to keep points short, with big serves and occasional flashes of his lethal forehand, followed by a classic fist pump and roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 80 Van de Zandschulp sought to put Nadal on his backhand and the indoor hard-court tournament was far from an ideal surface for the record 14-time Roland Garros winning 'King of Clay'.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman opened up two break points at 4-4 and took the second with a fine cross-court winner to claim the lead, and then converted his second set point to dampen Spanish spirits. (AFP)

    Guardiola set to extend stay as Man City boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola is set to extend his stay in charge of Manchester City by signing a one-year extension to his contract, the Athletic reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won six Premier League titles and the club's first ever Champions League since arriving at the Etihad in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach's current contract expires at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been speculation that Guardiola's time could be coming to an end with City facing an uncertain future due to an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League's financial regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's director of football Txiki Begiristain, a close ally of Guardiola, has confirmed his departure at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported that the 53-year-old will pen a one-year extension to his deal with the option for another year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola also signed his two previous contract extensions at City during the November international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions return to action on Saturday, looking to snap an unprecedented losing streak for their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has lost four consecutive games for the first time in his coaching career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hit by the loss of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri to a season-ending knee injury, City have fallen five points behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League after defeats to Bournemouth and Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also lost 4-1 to Sporting Lisbon in their last Champions League outing and were eliminated from the League Cup by Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola has won 15 major honours in total during his eight full seasons in Manchester, which also includes two FA Cups, four League Cups, one Club World Cup and one Uefa Super Cup. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China on Tuesday beat Mauritius 1-0 in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium to record their third consecutive victory for the first time in eight years.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a promising look for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood, as the win guarantees a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw – following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's goal in the 11th minute proved to be the winner, who cut in from the right wing to unleash a powerful left-foot drive just beyond the reach of Mauritius goalkeeper Kevin Jean-Louis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius had a player sent off in the 42nd minute for two yellow cards, but managed to hold on the rest of the way without conceding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory means Westwood is the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three straight games, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong are qualifying matches for the East Asian Football Federation, where they will take on Mongolia on December 8 and Chinese Taipei on December 14.

<img alt="Japan's Ao Tanaka and China's Wei Shihao and Lin Liangming are in action in Xiamen. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779963_1_20241119222713.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A ruthless Japan moved to the brink of qualifying for their eighth straight World Cup after beating China 3-1 away from home on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Headers from Koki Ogawa and Ko Itakura put runaway group leaders Japan two goals up at half time before Lin Liangming pulled one back for China early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa snuffed out China's hopes of a comeback with his second of the game six minutes later in front of a vociferous crowd of 45,000 in Xiamen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were playing their first senior international in China in nine years and there is a long history of rivalry between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was a heavy police presence outside the Xiamen Egret Stadium where hundreds of Japan fans were in attendance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loud booing greeted the Japanese national anthem before kick-off and the game was briefly stopped in the first half when a fan invaded the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win gave Japan five wins and a draw in Asian qualifying Group C and took them to within touching distance of a place at the 2026 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two teams in each of the three groups will reach the showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan are at home to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in their next fixtures in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  China gave a much-improved performance after losing 7-0 to Japan in Saitama in their opening group game.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have six points from six games and are still in the hunt for a place at their first World Cup since 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan made several changes to the team that beat Indonesia 4-0 in Jakarta on Friday with Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma and Crystal Palace's Daichi Kamada among those dropping to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ogawa opened the scoring in the 39th minute, planting a firm header past goalkeeper Wang Dalei direct from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan doubled their lead just before the half-time whistle and again it came from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Koki Machida flicked on Junya Ito's delivery and Itakura was unmarked at the back post to nod the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  China found the perfect reply to start the second half when Lin pulled a goal back for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xie Wenneng cleverly dummied Wei Shihao's pass and Lin slotted the ball past goalkeeper Zion Suzuki.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's joy lasted just six minutes before Ogawa headed in another Ito cross to restore Japan's two-goal cushion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy reached a second consecutive Billie Jean King Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland on Monday in Malaga.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Swiatek came from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles rubber but the Italian earned immediate revenge over the five-time Grand Slam winner in the deciding doubles clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini and veteran Sara Errani overcame Swiatek and Katarzyna Kawa 7-5, 7-5 in the doubles rubber to send the four-time champions through to Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening singles rubber, Italy's Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Magda Linette in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed by Swiatek's three-set battle with Paolini which ran over two-and-a-half hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough today – the intensity was insane, I was a little bit tired but I said to myself, you still have to play the doubles, you have to give everything for Italy, for my team," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I lost the singles match I was a little bit sad, but then tried to go in the locker room and think positive about the doubles," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linette, world number 38, was largely outclassed by Bronzetti, ranked 78th, in the first singles rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 4-1 down in the second set, Linette battled back strongly to force a tie-break but was eventually beaten when she slapped a return into the net after saving one match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  It left the pressure on Swiatek to deliver, which she did in thrilling fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten every time in their three prior clashes and having never managed to take a set off Swiatek, Paolini battled with fierce determination from the outset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek crushed the world number four in straight sets in the French Open final earlier this year but found a vastly tougher opponent in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole saved two break points to hold at 2-2 and then broke with a fizzing forehand to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not deter Paolini, who doubled down and won the next four games, securing two breaks of her own, to claim the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek spurned three break points in the final game and showed signs of tiredness after helping Poland reach the semi-finals by winning both her singles match and a doubles rubber against the Czech Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini had done the same for last year's runners-up Italy against Japan but dug deep to keep Swiatek at bay until the 10th and final game of the second set, which the Pole won to force a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the players exchanged breaks in the decider, Swiatek eventually triumphed when Paolini went long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 13 of the 16 break points she faced, proving the stronger in the key moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it was tough, my energy level was down in the second set but I managed to get back and that was the most important thing," said Swiatek, explaining she had "no time to celebrate" as the job was not done yet. (AFP)

 Bryan Zaragoza won and converted a late penalty to help Euro 2024 winners Spain beat Switzerland 3-2 in a Uefa Nations League dead rubber on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nations League holders, already guaranteed top spot in Group A4, twice took the lead but were pegged back by the already-relegated Swiss in Tenerife.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first Spain match on the island in 28 years and fans were able to celebrate a win after Bayern Munich winger Zaragoza's late spot-kick settled the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Luis de la Fuente changed his whole line-up from the win over Denmark on Friday, handing Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aitor Paredes his debut in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeremi Pino, a Canary Islander, sent Spain ahead on home territory after 32 minutes after Pedri's penalty was saved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Alvaro Morata won the penalty and handed Pedri, born in Tenerife, the ball to take the spot kick, but Yvon Mvogo saved the Barcelona midfielder's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here at home with a goal, the win – I can't ask for more," Pino said. "It was a very special game – full marks to the fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente sent on another Spain debutant at half-time in Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joel Monteiro levelled for Switzerland but a few minutes later Bryan Gil stole the ball back to restore Spain's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andi Zeqiri fired home from the spot after a foul by Fabian Ruiz in the 85th minute but Zaragoza ensured Spain could finish a spectacular year on a high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, on loan at Osasuna from Bayern, burst into the box and was brought crashing down by Vincent Sierro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaragoza clinically dispatched the resulting penalty to spark jubilant celebrations in Tenerife. (AFP)

    Bentancur gets seven-game ban over alleged racial slur

<img alt="Rodrigo Bentancur has since apologised to South Korean teammate Son Heung-min. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779739_1_20241118195332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur was on Monday given a seven-match domestic ban by the Football Association over an alleged racist remark made about teammate Son Heung-min in a TV interview.
 <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was charged by the FA in September in connection with an alleged breach of its rules during the interview in his home country of Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Juventus player, who has also been fined £100,000 (US$126,000), had been asked in June by a presenter for a Spurs player's shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replied: "Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur, 27, apologised to the South Korea international but because it was deemed an "aggravated breach," an independent regulatory commission panel was required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel upheld the charge and Bentancur will have to sit out Tottenham's next seven domestic fixtures, though he will be able to play in Europa League matches against Roma and Rangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA said in a statement that it was alleged that the incident constituted an "aggravated breach... as it included a reference – whether express or implied – to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rodrigo Bentancur denied this charge, but the independent regulatory commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son, speaking in late September, said: "He apologised straight afterwards when we had holiday. I was at home. I didn't even realise what was going on. He sent me a long message and you could feel it was coming from his heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said Bentancur had acknowledged his mistake and had pleaded for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur will not return to domestic action until December 26, missing Premier League matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Tottenham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Uruguayan has played 15 times for Tottenham this season, scoring one goal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

    Bills hand Chiefs first loss of 2024 NFL season

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) runs for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779644_1_20241118095924.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain knocked out defending Billie Jean King Cup champions Canada as singles wins for Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter completed a 2-0 victory in Malaga on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu powered through the first set of the opening rubber against Rebecca Marino and held off the Canadian in the second set to wrap up a 6-0, 7-5 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu saved seven break points as Marino tried to force a third set, eventually earning a break of her own in the 11th game before closing out the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments," said the 58th-ranked Raducanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 24 Boulter then brushed aside Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-4 to send Britain through to a semi-final against Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really happy with me level today," said Boulter, who produced another assured display after dropping only three games in her first-round match against Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to say, firstly, Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing a 1-0 up, so full credit to her for starting us off well," she added. "Really proud of my performance today. I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1981.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, the 2002 champions, overcame Australia 2-0 earlier in the day to make the last four of the competition for the first time in 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Rebecca Sramkova both won their singles ties as Slovakia backed up their victory over the United States in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another big country which we beat, and I'm so proud for the girls, for our team members, for our country – because we are a small country," said Slovakia captain Matej Liptak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it really means so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 241 Hruncakova emerged victorious against Kimberly Birrell 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 after over two-and-a-half hours on court to give the central European country the lead over Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova then needed just over an hour to win 6-1, 6-2 against former world number 32 Ajla Tomljanovic, who injured her knee in the third game of the first set.

  "We have nothing to lose. That's why I think we enjoy it so much. We are doing good, and hopefully we're going to keep doing that," said Hruncakova.

  On Monday, five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek will lead Poland as they take on world number four Jasmine Paolini's Italy in the other semi-final. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda captured her seventh LPGA title of the season and 15th career crown on Sunday, firing a three-under par 67 to win the Annika tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old American, playing her first event since being sidelined by a neck injury last month, reeled off five consecutive back-nine birdies to seize the crown by three strokes at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After taking some time off with an injury it was great to be back out here," Korda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing like being in the hunt," she added. "There's nothing like the adrenaline feeling going on the back nine, being in contention – I love it so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Im Jin-hee, China's Zhang Weiwei and England's Charley Hull shared second on 269 with Sweden's Linn Grant and American Rose Zhang sharing fifth on 270.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Korda's third victory in the event after taking the 2021 and 2022 titles and made her the first player since Taiwan's Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annika Sorenstam, the tournament namesake from Sweden, holds the record with 11 titles in the 2002 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is the first American player to win seven LPGA titles in a season since Beth Daniel in 1990 and four of Korda's victories, including Sunday's triumph, came when she trailed entering the final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensured she will be a heavy favorite at next week's season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda added to a 2024 LPGA trophy haul that began in January at the Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  It continued with wins at the Pak Se-ri Championship in Los Angeles, the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play ahead of her second major title at the Chevron Championship and the Americas Open in May, her most recent victory until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The neck injury kept Korda from playing in October in Asia and she had not walked a full 18 holes in nearly two months until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda struggled early with a bogey at the second hole then sandwiched a birdie between bogeys at the sixth and eighth holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that only set the stage for Korda's run of birdies from the 11th through 15th holes, going from two adrift to secure the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not a lot of happy thoughts at the beginning," Korda said. "You should have felt the nerves I was feeling on the back nine." (AFP)

    Sinner defeats Fritz to claim first ATP Finals title

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner won the ATP Finals on Sunday after beating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 to claim his first title at the season-ending event in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner's triumph on home soil was the latest moment of glory in a near-perfect year in which the 23-year-old won eight tournaments, including his debut Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing, it's my first title in Italy and it means so much to me," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something very special. I just tried to understand what works best for each opponent, trying to play my best possible tennis – that was the key," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner again swept Fritz aside in straight sets just as he did in the group stage and the US Open final in September, improving his record on hard courts this year to 50-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is the first Italian to win the Finals, doing so days after becoming the first from his nation to top the ATP's end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Tour-leading 70th win of the season made him the first player since Ivan Lendl in 1986 to win the tournament without dropping a set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to make myself better than last year, to find the keys to win this final. I'm very happy to have handled this pressure and to share this success with the Italian crowd," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went in Sinner's favour after an enthralling seventh game which lasted nine minutes and was eventually won on the fourth break point.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite Fritz's best efforts he couldn't fight back, failing to get a single break point in the second set and succumbing to his opponent's superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz fell short in his bid to become the event's first American champion since Pete Sampras in 1999 but will rise to a career-best of fourth in the rankings Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the good results, it's been a great week for me," said Fritz, beaten for the fourth time in five meetings with Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Jannik and his team because he plays incredible tennis, really incredible," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian great at the top of the game, winning 26 of his past 27 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against his initial exoneration has been hanging over his head since September, when WADA announced it was seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner now heads to Malaga where he hopes to lead Italy to a successful defence of their Davis Cup title. (AFP)

<img alt="It was Rory McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779589_1_20241117212717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship for the third time and claimed his sixth Race to Dubai title in the process on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland made a crucial birdie on the par-4 16th hole to break a deadlock with Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then birdied the par-5 18th hole for a three-under-par 69 that took him to 15-under for the four days and was enough for a two-shot win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus, who was trying to follow in the footsteps of his twin brother Nicolai and take the trophy back to Denmark for a second year in a row, made a stunning 22-footer par save on the 17th hole, but could not put the pressure on McIlroy on the 18th as he settled for a par and a final round score of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who started with a bogey and then made four successive birdies, dropped a couple of shots around the turn to be tied with Hojgaard after 15 holes at 13-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finally edged ahead with a stunning second shot on the par-4 16th hole from 137 yards to less than a foot for his fifth birdie of the day and drained a six-footer on the final hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including the Zurich Classic that the world number three claimed alongside Shane Lowry, it was McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season and secured him the Race to Dubai crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Adam Scott and Ireland's Lowry shot final-round 68s to tie for third place at 11-under par alongside France's Antoine Rozner. England's Tyrrell Hatton was solo 6th at 10-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 10 players who earned their PGA Tour cards include Hojgaard, Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, England's Paul Waring, Dane Niklas Norgaard, Swede Jesper Svensson, Antoine Rozner of France, Italy's Matteo Manassero, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, Japan's Rikuya Hoshino and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland.

<img alt="Jorge Martin celebrates with the fans after a stunningly consistent season earned him the title. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779590_1_20241117223710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish rider Jorge Martin claimed his first MotoGP world championship title after finishing third in the season-ending Barcelona GP on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defending two-time champion Francesco Bagnaia, who started the race 19 points behind Martin, took the chequered flag for the 11th time this season but it was not enough to wrest the title from the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It sounds amazing," said an emotional Martin after being addressed as a world champion for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know what to say, I am completely shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is for my people, for my family, for the people who are supporting me, this is for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started crying at the end, it was a very emotional race. It's been a long journey, a lot of crashes, big injuries but finally we are here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope we can keep improving and enjoy the moment. This is the most important thing: live the present and enjoy the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin, who will be leaving his Ducati satellite team Pramac for Aprilia next season, had made himself the favourite for the title with a remarkably consistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had only won three grand prix all season, but his third place on Sunday was the 32nd time this season across the 40 sprints and grand prix that he made the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing third in Saturday's sprint he knew he had only to finish in the top nine to secure the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia, however, has finished the season in blistering form, his victory in Barcelona giving him his fourth win over the final five races of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from pole, the Italian made a perfect start but was soon under pressure from Marc Marquez who slipped past Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin let them battle it out up front, guarding his track position as Aleix Espargaro and Alex Marquez toughed it out behind him.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Martin crossed the line, the celebrations began in the Pramac garage and amongst the many Spanish fans who had made the journey to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was due to take place in Valencia but had to be moved after the region suffered its worst floods in a generation which have killed more than 220 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was switched to Barcelona and has been dubbed the Solidarity GP to show support for the people of Valencia, with all proceeds of the event going to the Valencia relief fund. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fly-half Thomas Ramos kicked 15 points to help France beat New Zealand 30-29 in a thrilling Test clash in Paris on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romain Buros, Paul Boudehent and Louis Bielle-Biarrey were the hosts' try-scorers as they claimed a third-straight win over the All Blacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lakai and Cam Roigard crossed for New Zealand before Damian McKenzie's contributions with the boot set-up a nervy last half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  France head coach Fabien Galthie recalled experienced centre Gael Fickou to the starting lineup in one of four changes from last Saturday's easy win over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand boss Scott Robertson welcomed back fly-half Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor after the influential pair missed last week's win over Ireland with injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the game New Zealand captain Scott Barrett said his side lost the scrum battle with the French in their World Cup defeat 13 months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the set-piece proved crucial in the opening score as the visitors were penalised and Les Bleus led 3-0 after seven minutes thanks to a Ramos shot at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robertson's outfit reacted almost immediately to make it 7-3 as Lakai, a second-minute replacement, crashed over for his maiden Test try and Beauden Barrett slotted the extras after nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks had the upper hand after the opening quarter, profiting from a poor France lineout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their dominance paid off even further after half an hour as scrum-half Roigard celebrated his 24th birthday by intercepting a pass destined for opposite number Antoine Dupont after a scrum to stroll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  With seven minutes of the first-half to play, France cut the score to 14-10 as full-back Buros crossed on his Test debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the interval, New Zealand led 17-10 as Beauden Barrett added a penalty to his earlier two conversions with the visitors in control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, the tight one-pass play paid off for the hosts as they trundled up the field before flanker Boudehent found a way over from a rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos kicked the conversion to bring the sides level at 17-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie had picked an extra forward on the bench by dropping fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the matchday squad and after 47 minutes brought on four of them at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, it bore fruit, as France led for the first time in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winger Bielle-Biarrey dotted down after a Ramos grubber kick and with the Toulouse playmaker's extras they were 24-17 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the try, the game was far from over and with 17 minutes to go McKenzie kicked two penalties either side of a Ramos effort to make it 27-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKenzie added a third penalty for 27-26 with 13 minutes to go and a tense final 10 minutes was set-up as Ramos and McKenzie once again traded shots at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks were camped in their own territory but their attack was held up and referee Nika Amashukeli blew the full-time whistle to send the majority of the 80,000-capacity crowd delirious. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anthony Davis scored 40 points and LeBron James made more history to spark the Los Angeles Lakers over San Antonio 120-115 on Friday, launching their bid to defend the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  James managed a triple-double in a fourth consecutive game for the first time in his 22 NBA seasons, the 39-year-old legend delivering 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists over a game-high 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the game and I'm happy I'm still able to come out here and make some plays to help our ball club win," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  James tied a Lakers triple-double record streak and became the oldest player in NBA history with four triple-doubles in a row, all in winning efforts, although his seven turnovers stung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just putting the work in. My teammates trust me with the ball," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess they trusted me a little too much tonight with the seven turnovers. I've got to be a lot better than that if I'm going to have the ball in my hands. I'll clean that up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, won a battle of the big men with last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, Frenchman Victor Wembanyama, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Spurs in the West Group B clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another magnificent game by AD," James said. "We lean on AD every night. The ball goes to him not only the first option but also the second option... He has definitely been a beast this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Stephon Castle's basket gave the Spurs a 115-114 lead, Davis made a slam dunk with 91 seconds to play and James sank a layup, his first basket in more than 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Castle missed a tying 3-point attempt and James made two free throws to seal San Antonio's fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis drove to the hoop and banged his right knee into the left knee of Wembanyama late in the game but both were playing at the finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, downing Chicago 144-126 as games were played in all six NBA Cup groups with results also counting in the NBA regular-season standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland improved to 14-0 as Donovan Mitchell scored 37 points to lead the East Group C rout.

  <br>
  "It's just so much fun. The vibes are right," Cleveland's Jarrett Allen said. "It just seems like everything is clicking right now."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson's controversial return to boxing ended in a one-sided defeat on Friday, with Youtuber-turned-prizefighter Jake Paul cruising to victory by a unanimous decision against the heavyweight icon in Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, 58, barely landed a punch during the eight-round bout at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, with Paul winning by big margins on all three cards – 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, 27, used his superior speed and movement to dominate the ageing Tyson with ease, and had the former undisputed heavyweight champion in trouble after landing a flurry of punches in the third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the younger fighter was unable to land the knockout blow he had promised to deliver during Thursday's ill-tempered weigh-in, where Tyson slapped him across the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, however, looked every bit of his 58 years, managing to land only a handful of meaningful punches during the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final statistics showed Tyson connected with just 18 of 97 punches thrown while Paul threw some 278 punches and landed 78 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the final seconds of the eighth round counted down, Paul could even afford to bow in respect to Tyson before the bell sounded. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland rebounded from defeat to New Zealand by edging Argentina 22-19 in a nailbiting one-off rugby union Test at Lansdowne Road on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish led by 13 points at the break but a lack of discipline and excellent play by the Pumas almost gave the visitors their first ever win in Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went right down to the wire there," Ireland skipper Caelen Doris told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were happy with how it started. There was a good feeling through the warm-up and that carried over to the start. I felt we were in a pretty good position at half time and their quality showed in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ireland started brightly but it was the Pumas who thought they had struck first through Matias Moroni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead Moroni trudged off after receiving a yellow card for a head collision with Irish fly-half Jack Crowley earlier in the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Crowley who was celebrating a minute later as he went over for his second Test try and converting it for 7-0 in the fourth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barely a minute had passed since Crowley's try when Garry Ringrose broke through the centre and a sublime pass by Jamison Gibson-Park found Tadhg Beirne, who selflessly passed inside to Mack Hansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-born wing touched down for his 10th Test try -- Crowley failed to convert but the Irish were 12-0 up inside six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz got his team on the board with a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish piled the pressure on the visitors and were denied a third try after Beirne knocked on as he went to touch the ball down.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they lost prop Finlay Bealham to a yellow card in the 17th minute for a dangerous tackle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Farrell looked rueful in the coach's box as Bealham trotted off with Albornoz knocking over the penalty for 12-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley landed a sweetly struck drop goal to make it 15-6 to the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz's unerring boot added three more points shortly before Bealham returned to the fray for 15-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas resisted waves of Irish attacks but finally cracked just after the half hour mark as Joe McCarthy powered over for his second Test try -- Crowley converted for 22-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Irish line somehow held out as the Pumas pressed in the final few minutes of the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ringrose turned the ball over and the hosts breathed easier as they headed in 22-9 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Pumas responded brilliantly after the break, fullback Juan Cruz Mallia broke through from deep, Ringrose and Hansen failing to bring him down, and touched down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz converted for 22-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish discipline was creaking just as it did against the All Blacks, conceding three penalties within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Paul Williams had had enough of Irish offsides and sent McCarthy to the sin bin much to Farrell's frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz moved past 100 points in Test rugby with a smoothly taken penalty for 22-19 and just under half an hour to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The penalty count went to 10 as Crowley took out Albornoz in the air, but at the end of the next phase of play the Pumas' fly-half sent a drop goal attempt wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farrell rang the changes just after the hour including replacing Crowley with 21-year-old Sam Prendergast for his first cap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night came in the 67th minute as prop Cian Healy came on to equal Brian O'Driscoll's Irish record of 133 caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish were hanging on but received a huge boost when Pumas replacement Francisco Gomez Kodela was sin-binned for a head shot on Doris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas were the ones pressing right at the end and were inside the 22 when the Irish managed to turn the ball over. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson could not wait to put on the gloves to take a shot at upcoming opponent Jake Paul, striking the social media influencer-turned-boxer in the face as they approached each other at Thursday's weigh-in at Arlington, Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-time "Baddest Man on the Planet," 58-year-old Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years against "ultimate heel" Paul in the wildly anticipated showdown at the AT&T Stadium on Friday (8 pm EST).
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no love lost between the two as Tyson, who weighed in at 228.4 pounds, approached Paul and immediately slapped the 27-year-old in the face and offered a two-word televised remark before walking off stage: "Talking's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, who gained a cult following on YouTube before turning to boxing four years ago, was far more loquacious, offering an expletive-riddled rant about his plans to demolish Tyson, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's angry, he's an angry little elf," said Paul, who weighed in at 227.2 pounds. "It's personal now – he must die!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight is the first live boxing match that Netflix has aired, as the streamer with more than 280 million subscribers makes inroads into the sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match has drawn extraordinary global interest but also criticism, with British promoter Eddie Hearn dismissing the bout as "dangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, said in an interview last month that the fight was not about the payday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not for financial reasons. My life is not going to change, not one percentage point after this fight. We will always be able to live this way," he said. "And I'm just doing it because I want to test myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, Paul will get US$40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August. Tyson will get US$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tyson's last professional fight was a loss against Kevin McBride in 2005. The fight against Paul will be shorter: eight two-minute rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12 three-minute rounds. Both boxers will also use heavier 14-ounce gloves instead of the typical 10-ounce gloves. (Reuters/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 34-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

    Sinner beats Medvedev for perfect ATP Finals group run

<img alt="Sinner reacts after defeating Medvedev in his final group match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779233_1_20241115071240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    Haughey takes break from swimming to ponder future

<img alt="Siobhan Haughey says she is getting old after taking part in the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in three cities. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778903_1_20241113180939.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey said she will be taking a three- to four-month break from the sport to consider her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" had mentioned before the Paris Olympics of possible retirement, which she said on Wednesday is still on her mind after the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai, Incheon and Singapore during which she won five gold, two silvers and two bronze medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to use this break to think about what my future direction will be. These three stops at the World Cup has made me realise that I am getting old, and that my body recovery is taking more time," the 27-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will be competing at the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest from December 10 to 15 before taking the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is looking forward to spending the Christmas holiday with her family because she spent previous years taking part in competitions around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she hopes to use the break to do things that she usually doesn't get to do because of training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey was speaking to reporters after a ceremony at the South China Athletic Association where the newly completed Water Sports Centre was named after her.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she feels honoured given that she spent a lot of time practising at the association as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she participated in the design for the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this isn't just meaningful to me, but I hope it's meaningful to the community because I'm trying to use what I'm doing to promote swimming and to promote sports," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that the next generation can be here to witness this, and hopefully they find some sort of inspiration through all of this and think this is meaningful too."

    Sinner downs Fritz to close in on ATP Finals last four

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner hit the accelerator at the end of each set as he cruised past Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 on Tuesday to close in on a semi-final spot at the ATP Finals in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In September, Sinner had to overcome raucous home support to win his last meeting with the American as he claimed victory in the final of the US Open, also in straight sets. This time, the Turin crowd was nosily behind the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd is helping me a lot," said Sinner on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard-hitting Fritz, ranked number five, put pressure on Sinner's serve early in the first set. The American had the first break point of the match in the 14-minute seventh game, but could not take his chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner responded at once, but wasted three break points in the next game before breaking to 15 in the 10th game to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling to return his serve but I am happy with how I handled the situation," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set also went with serve until the 10th game when Fritz double-faulted on Sinner's first match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very tough match," said Sinner. "We got to know each other very well in a Grand Slam final, we knew exactly what to expect today it was very aggressive as I was prepared for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory put Sinner top of the Ilie Nastase group with just Daniil Medvedev to face. The home favourite could still be eliminated with a straight-sets loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz faces Alex de Minaur who has lost both his matches so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the afternoon match, former champion Medvedev brushed aside Finals debutant De Minaur 6-2, 6-4 to bounce back from an opening defeat and boost his hopes of making the knock-out phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, who lost his first group-stage match to Fritz, overpowered De Minaur to push his Australian opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who lifted the title in 2020, did not face a single break point and broke De Minaur's serve three times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth seed will next face Sinner on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I decided not to care about it in a good way," Medvedev said. "If I lose, the season is over, if I win I have another chance on Thursday – I'll try and do the same the next match, so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players battled to holds in their opening service games, but Medvedev broke for a 2-1 lead and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck 16 winners in the first set and then lost just two points behind his serve in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  A break in the ninth game of the second set proved decisive and he closed out victory with another comfortable hold. (AFP)

    Wittich replaced as F1 race director in surprise move

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula 1's race director Niels Wittich has left his role with immediate effect, the FIA said on Tuesday, in a surprise move.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German, who replaced Michael Masi in 2022, will be replaced for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 23 by Rui Marques, who was recently the race director for Formula 2 and 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FIA can confirm that Niels Wittich has stepped down from his position as F1 Race Director to pursue new opportunities," the FIA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is extremely rare for an F1 race director to be changed mid-season, but the FIA did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masi was removed as Formula One race director after his controversial management of the season-ending 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Max Verstappen pipped Lewis Hamilton to the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not clear if Wittich is the latest victim of a disagreement with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of staff in senior FIA roles have resigned this year. (AFP)

<img alt="Barcelona players celebrate scoring their second goal against St. Poelten. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778786_1_20241113082111.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-goal blitz in the space of 12 minutes sent Barcelona on their way to a 7-0 romp over St. Poelten in the Uefa Women's Champions League on Tuesday, while Manchester City stayed top of Group D with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal beat Juventus 4-0 in Italy but remain second in Group C after Bayern Munich extended their 100 percent record with a 3-0 victory over Valerenga.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Barcelona, Ewa Pajor, Francisca Nazareth, Aitana Bonmati, Keira Walsh and Claudia Pina all scored between the 32nd and 45th minutes, before Pina and Caroline Graham Hansen added goals in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite scoring 16 goals and conceding none in their last two European outings, holders Barca sit second in Group D after they lost their opening fixture at Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Objective met – yes, absolutely," Barca coach Pere Romeu said after his side's second emphatic victory in three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when we couldn't score in the first half an hour, we were getting in behind them. And I knew once we got the first goal, more would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's St Poelten stay bottom of the group with three losses from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The floodgates opened at the Johan Cruyff Stadium shortly after the half-hour when Pajor slid onto full-back Ona Batlle's cross at the near post and directed the ball into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stand-in captain Marta Torrejon nearly doubled the score soon after she rose highest from a set-piece, but her looping header clipped the top of the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from picking up her second Ballon d'Or last month, Aitana Bonmati nearly caught Carina Schlueter out with a chip but the goalkeeper just managed to claw out the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were all over the Austrians. When Bonmati got in behind the defence on the right, her cross was parried to Nazareth who made no mistake on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmati opened her account in the Champions League this season two minutes later, before Walsh fizzed home a side-footed strike from outside the box in the 42nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the stroke of half-time, Pina flitted in at the back post to guide home an outside-of-the-foot volley as Barca ran riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish forward then completed her brace from 12 yards seven minutes after the interval following a foul on the rampaging Batlle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Graham added a seventh in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man City stayed three points ahead of Barca after second-half goals by Laura Brown and Aoba Fujino overcame Sweden's Hammarby 2-0. (AFP)

    FA launches investigation into referee Coote

<img alt="Referee David Coote during the Premier League football match between Liverpool and Brighton. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778784_1_20241113081326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Football Association is investigating after a video was posted on social media appearing to show Premier League referee David Coote making derogatory comments about Liverpool and their former manager Jurgen Klopp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Referees body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd announced on Monday that Coote, 42, had been suspended pending a full investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Football Association is also looking at Coote's comments. It is understood part of its investigation will centre on whether Coote's reference to Klopp's nationality constitutes an aggravated breach of its misconduct rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware of the matter, and we are investigating it," an FA spokesman said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the clip, Coote, who refereed Liverpool's 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday, said Klopp was "arrogant" and used offensive language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retired referee Mike Dean, now a TV pundit, believes the incident will have a damaging effect on officials throughout English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As referees you can't put yourself in that position no matter what you do," the 56-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can say things away from camera, you can talk amongst your friends and things and colleagues," he added. "But you can't let somebody video this and then hope that it's never going to come out."
  <br>
  <br>
  The video appears to refer to a match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1. Liverpool had already been crowned champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp criticised Coote after the match, saying the referee had been too lenient in his treatment of Burnley challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp left Liverpool at the end of last season after nearly nine years in charge at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was also critical of Coote over an incident in a match against Arsenal last season in which Gunners midfielder Martin Odegaard's hand made contact with the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote, as VAR, did not advise on-field official Chris Kavanagh to review the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote was also the VAR in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in October 2020 when Toffees goalkeeper Jordan Pickford inflicted a season-ending injury on Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pickford was not sent off for the challenge and did not face retrospective action because, under FA rules, that can only happen if an incident was not seen either at the time or when it was reviewed by VAR. (AFP)

<img alt="The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance sports medicine in Hong Kong. Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Sports Institute" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778718_2_20241112183046.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind once more to preserve their 100 percent start to the season with a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, who overcame a 14-point deficit to beat Brooklyn on Saturday, were again forced to dig deep, battling back from nine points down in the third quarter for a road victory that takes them to 12-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led another fine all-round offensive performance from Cleveland, who have emerged as the surprise package of the season and are the only undefeated team in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six Cleveland players finished in double figures, with point guard Darius Garland adding 17 points and Evan Mobley 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and Ty Jerome all had 12 points each off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago meanwhile were left ruing their inability to take full advantage after pulling into an 85-76 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Cleveland came roaring back with a 9-0 run to tie the game and then pulled ahead to lead by three points heading into the fourth quarter, before closing out victory by outscoring Chicago 24-21 in the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zach LaVine led Chicago's scorers with 26 points, while Coby White and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points apiece. The Bulls fell to 4-7 with the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We dug deep," Mitchell said after the win. "Honestly, the bench saved us. Starters were a little fatigued, and I guess teams are coming at us. But we persevered, and shoutout to the bench for that – it's a group effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us to continue to be what we want to be, that's what it's going to take," he added. "It was a complete team win – every night it's somebody different. We're playing for each other, being selfless. We've got to keep it going." (AFP)

    Ohtani nominated for MVP after historic 2024 campaign

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was named among the nominees for Major League Baseball's National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday after a historic debut season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is bidding for back-to-back MVP honours after winning the award last season while playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the American League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, who has already won two MVP awards in his career, is coming off a season which saw him become the first player in history to amass 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old slugger also helped the Dodgers claim a second World Series in five seasons in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani faces competition from shortstop Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the American League meanwhile, New York Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Juan Soto were nominated alongside Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MVP awards, which are voted on by a ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWA), will be announced on November 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the nominees announced for the National League manager of the year award, with the Dodgers' World Series-winning manager Dave Roberts failing to make the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roberts was tipped to be among the favourites after guiding the Dodgers to an MLB-best 98 regular season wins, despite having a pitching staff decimated by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Roberts missed out, with Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets, the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Murphy and the San Diego Padres' Mike Shildt named as the nominees. (AFP)

    World number one Sinner receives year-end ATP trophy

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner spent his first rest day at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday collecting the trophy for finishing the year ranked the number one tennis player in the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner entered the season-ending event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult," Sinner added, calling himself "very lucky".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian, who won his first match at finals on Sunday against Australian Alex De Minaur, succeeds Serbia's Novak Djokovic, who finished the year as world number one a record eight times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boris Becker, who spent 221 days at number one in 1991 but never ended a year on top, attended the presentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while "there are certainly Carlos Alcaraz and others, Jannik is going to be world number one for a long time." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

<img alt="Casemiro of Manchester United during the English championship Premier League football match between Manchester United and Leicester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778583_1_20241111213136.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi's goal of winning the MLS Cup title came to an abrupt end on Saturday with his Inter Miami suffering a shock first-round elimination from the playoffs after a 3-2 home defeat to Atlanta United FC.
 <br>
  <br>
  Miami had won the regular season campaign with a record points total but after losing twice in the best-of-three series, the MLS Cup favourites and their eight-times Ballon d'Or winner are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the accolades Miami received for their regular season 'Supporters' Shield' triumph count for little after an Atlanta team which finished ninth in the Eastern Conference pulled off a stunning upset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter took the lead in the 17th minute when Messi was denied by a diving save from Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan but Matías Rojas followed in to slot home the loose ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Messi who finally broke through in the 65th minute, meeting a Marcelo Weigandt cross from the right with a thundering header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami pushed forward in search of the winner but instead they were caught out once again with Pedro Amador's cross from the left headed home at the back post by Polish midfielder Bartosz Slisz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter players were furious that the referee had allowed play to continue while their defender Tomás Avilés lay injured on the floor but their frustration was in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final whistle brought a deflated silence over Chase Stadium as Miami's season, which so many had expected would end with their first MLS Cup title, concluded with the sight of Guzan and his Atlanta team-mates celebrating.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Miami head coach Gerardo Martino, who won MLS Cup with Atlanta in 2018, an inquest is sure to follow but he tried to put a brave face on the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season has had good and bad things. If you think about where we were in November last year, there has obviously been progress in terms of the club, not just the team," he said. "If you think about the expectations we had for this playoffs, obviously we came up a little short," said the Argentine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martino said there was a despondent mood in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are sad, as they should be when there are so many expectations and the team can't fulfil them," he added. "In this final part of the year we got used to achieving the objectives but we couldn't achieve the most important one." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten start to the NFL season after blocking a last-gasp field goal to snatch a dramatic 16-14 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reigning Super Bowl champions looked poised to suffer their first defeat of the campaign after rookie Broncos quarterback Bo Nix expertly engineered a late fourth-quarter drive to the Kansas City 17-yard line.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left Wil Lutz with what should have been a straightforward 35-yard chip shot to win the game with the final kick of an absorbing clash at Arrowhead Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lutz and the Broncos were left stunned after Chiefs' defensive end Mike Danna got a hand to the kick to block the attempt and leave Kansas City exhaling a collective sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes raced across the field in celebration with his teammates as Kansas City sealed a win that sees them improve to 9-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just speaks to this entire team," Mahomes said of Kansas City's great escape. "I felt offensively we didn't do enough. Defensively we stepped it up in the second half, and then special teams – we're a full team. It's everybody, it was a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody believes, no one has any doubts, we just keep pushing and we found a way in the end," the 29-year-old Mahomes added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was hard on Broncos signal-caller Nix, who had shown superb composure throughout to help Denver take a 14-3 second quarter lead thanks to touchdown passes wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Courtland Sutton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's defense, meanwhile, gave Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a torrid time, sacking the Kansas City quarterback four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes, though, gradually got his team back into the game, connecting with Travis Kelce for a touchdown that made it 14-10 at the half, before two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half gave them a slender 16-14 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nix then appeared to have done enough to give Denver a chance at winning the game, only for the blocked field goal drama to deny the Broncos a famous win. (AFP)
