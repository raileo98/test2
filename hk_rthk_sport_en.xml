    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

    Judd Trump 'much happier' playing as HK resident

 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in a major tournament at Kai Tak next March as a Hong Kong resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in 35 years, the SAR will stage a ranking event as the World Snooker Tour announced earlier that the World Grand Prix will take place at the brand new Kai Tak Sports Park between March 4 and 9, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who just obtained a Hong Kong passport through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic is confident he can still win Grand Slams, starting at the Australian Open, with the Serbian kickstarting his bid for an unprecedented 11th title and record 25th major crown in Brisbane this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who is gunning for a third Melbourne Park trophy, joins him at the Queensland Tennis Centre from December 29-January 5 in a stellar women's field.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 season gets under way on Friday with the mixed-teams United Cup in Perth and Sydney, headlined by world number two Iga Swiatek in her first tournament since revelations that she served a one-month doping suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first season since 37-year-old Djokovic began playing that none of the other so-called "Big Four" will be on the other side of the net following the retirements this year of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they faded, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz stepped up to become the new Grand Slam kings, with both men opting against a warm-up tournament leading into the first major of the year which begins on January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  As doubts grew over Djokovic's motivation and ability to take down the new guard after a disappointing 2024, he stunned the tennis world by hiring Murray to coach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resurgent Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune, and Frances Tiafoe are also playing in Brisbane, as is Australian Nick Kyrgios, who returns after injuries restricted him to just one ATP Tour singles match in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenging Sabalenka on Pat Rafter Arena will be America's top talents Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seven and eight respectively, along with former world number two Ons Jabeur and veteran Victoria Azarenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, who beat China's high-flying Zheng Qinwen in the Melbourne final this year, had a sensational 2024 which culminated in being named WTA Player of Year this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has capped off a historic 2024 by winning The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the third time, tying him with basketball great Michael Jordan. He trails only four-time winners Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods and LeBron James.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very honoured,” Ohtani said through translator Matt Hidaka. ”Obviously all the hard work has paid off. Maybe next year, I’ll get the award again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In balloting by 74 sports journalists from the AP and its members, Ohtani received 48 votes. He previously won the award in 2023 and 2021, when he was with the Los Angeles Angels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Japan, I did follow Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods,” he said. “I would see their accolades and how they were successful in the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP honour has been given out since 1931. Golfer Babe Didrikson won six times, the most by a man or woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimmer Léon Marchand of France, who won four gold medals at the Paris Olympics, was second with 10 votes in balloting announced Monday. Golfer Scottie Scheffler, whose victories this year included the Masters and an Olympic gold medal, was third with nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP Female Athlete of the Year will be announced on Wednesday. (AP)

    Arsenal's Saka sidelined 'weeks' with hamstring injury

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka will be sidelined for "many weeks" after suffering a hamstring injury in Arsenal's 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, with manager Mikel Arteta describing his loss as a "huge" blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The England winger went down midway through the first half at Selhurst Park on Saturday and had to be replaced by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not looking good. He will be out for many weeks," Arteta said at a press conference, adding he could not be more specific.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard said the loss of the 23-year-old, who has nine goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season, would force him into a rethink.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously he's a big player for us," he said. "You just have to see the impact that he has on the team, but it's going to be a really good exercise for all of us to think about ways to overcome another challenge – because we've already had a lot in the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said Saka was "gutted" and "really emotional" after discovering the extent of his injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that fellow winger Raheem Sterling had injured his knee and would be out for a number of weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to look internally at what we have and be creative," said the Gunners boss, adding that he did not know if the club would sign a winger in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was filmed leaving Selhurst Park on crutches, souring what had been a comprehensive second win over the Palace in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta, whose third-placed team face Premier League strugglers Ipswich on Saturday, said he was confident that Saka would be back well before the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the development of a player," Arteta said. "At some stage, at this level, you are going to get injured – unfortunately badly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could have been worse, it could have been something else that can take you out for a year," he added. "It's how you react to that, how you overcome that situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said he was "putting some ideas together" about how to cope in the winger's absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the congested fixture schedule had played a part in Saka's injury, Arteta said the issue was more to do with consistently high workloads over many seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, Bukayo and Declan (Rice), they played over 130 games in two seasons," he said. "So what's going to happen in the second one, the third one or the fourth one, if that continues the same way? It's unsustainable." (AFP)

    England captain Stokes out three months with injury

<div class="itemFullText">
 England Test captain Ben Stokes faces at least three months out after tearing his left hamstring during the tour of New Zealand, team management announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder had already been ruled out of next year's Champions Trophy one-day international tournament in Pakistan and the preceding white-ball tour of India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further assessments have since revealed the full extent of the injury, with Stokes set to undergo surgery in January, said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes suffered the injury while bowling during the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes did not bat in the second innings of that match as England slumped to a 423-run defeat – a result that meant his side still won a three-match series 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  He previously missed this year's home series against Sri Lanka and the first Test in Pakistan after tearing the hamstring on the same left leg in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  England's next Test is at home to Zimbabwe in May. They will then host a five-match Test series against India starting in June, before their pinnacle 2025 to 2026 Ashes tour of Australia. (AFP)

 Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokić shook off a slow start to post a 27-point triple-double as the Nuggets rallied to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 132-129 in overtime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jokić, who claimed his third MVP in four years last season, added 13 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb star, who was held to six points in the first half, bemoaned another slow start for Denver – who trailed by as many as 17 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took a 111-109 lead on Julian Strawther's layup with just over four minutes left in regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  CJ McCollum put New Orleans back in front 119-117 with 53.2 seconds left in the fourth, but Denver guard Jamal Murray drilled a step-back basket with nine seconds to go to tie it at 119-119, and when McCollum missed a three-pointer they went to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokić took over in the extra session, scoring Denver's first six points as they handed the Pelicans a seventh straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seems like we just like it that way," Jokić said of the late heroics needed by the Nuggets. "But we should be more hungry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray also scored 27 points for Denver, and Russell Westbrook added 21 off the bench. Jordan Hawkins led New Orleans' scoring with 25 points and McCollum had 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers posted their fourth straight win in impressive style, powering away in the second half to beat the Kings 122-95 in Sacramento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam delivered a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds and the Pacers put up 70 points in the second half of a dominant victory in which seven Indiana players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Turner scored 15 points, star guard Tyrese Haliburton and reserve Ben Sheppard added 14 apiece and T.J. McConnell contributed 12 points and 10 assists off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We brought it from start to finish," Sheppard said. "The energy we brought, both the bench and the starters – it was a great team win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Point guard De'Aaron Fox scored 23 points to lead the Kings, and Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 21 rebounds – but Kings fans were booing as the team fell to a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough night for us," Kings coach Mike Brown said. "There are going to be nights when you don't have it offensively, but we can't give up 70 points in a half." (AFP)

    Last-gasp comeback lifts Commanders over Eagles

<img alt="Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels celebrates with teammate Olamide Zaccheaus (14). Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784627_1_20241223080808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw five touchdown passes on Sunday as the Commanders halted Philadelphia's 10-game NFL winning streak with a 36-33 victory in which the Eagles also lost quarterback Jalen Hurts to a concussion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders piled up 22 points in the fourth quarter, rookie signal-caller Daniels finding Jamison Crowder with a nine-yard touchdown pass with six seconds left to secure what had seemed an unlikely win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game's never over until the clock hits zero," Daniels said after a win that kept the Commanders' playoff hopes alive while eliminating Dallas and San Francisco from contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels awesome," Daniels added. "Everybody can enjoy their Christmas now."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You got those guys that came in on the win streak they were on, they were hot and they’re a very good team," he went on to say. "And rightfully so, good offense, good defence, all-around well-prepared team and you want to go out there and see where you match up against those type of guys."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles, who hadn't lost since September, were without Hurts for most of the game after he hit his head on the turf after a tackle in the first quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Pickett replaced him and threw for 143 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but at 12-3 the Eagles dropped out of a tie for best record in the NFC and failed to clinch the NFC East division title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions remained atop the NFC with a franchise-record 13th victory, cruising past the Bears 34-17 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stung by a loss to Buffalo that snapped their 11-game winning streak, the Lions jumped to a 20-point lead on the way to setting a single-season franchise record for points scored with 493 so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lios quarterback Jared Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, including an 82-yard TD pass to Jameson Williams, who had a career-high 143 receiving yards on five catches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, as the Lions used a trick play in which Goff pretended to stumble to spring tight end Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive of the second half. (AFP/AP)

    Mbappé strikes as Real Madrid down Sevilla

<img alt="Mbappé opened the scoring for Real Madrid, who recorded their twelfth straight victory in all competitions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784625_1_20241223074531.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé scored a screamer and set up another goal as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 4-2 on Sunday to move second in La Liga above stuttering rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Atlético Madrid beat Barca on Saturday to claim top spot at Christmas, Carlo Ancelotti's side also took advantage with a comfortable home win which leaves them a point behind the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Ancelotti said ahead of Sevilla's visit that Mbappé's adaptation period had ended following his summer switch from Paris Saint-Germain and the French forward proved the coach right with a strong performance and his 14th goal of the season across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fede Valverde also netted a brilliant effort from range, with Rodrygo Goes and Brahim Diaz on the scoresheet for the hosts too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio scored for Sevilla, although they were thoroughly outplayed on veteran defender Jesus Navas' final game for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that we know each other better, my arrival changed a lot of things, and now, as the coach said, the adaptation is over and I feel very good in the team," Mbappé said. "We can see on the pitch that I click better with my team-mates and now we're all playing better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé, back after a brief absence with a thigh injury, scored for Madrid in midweek as they won the Intercontinental Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was welcome relief for the forward after missing two penalties in recent weeks against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, as well as suffering criticism for his form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I've got much more in my legs than I'm showing, but in the last games I've played better," Mbappé added. "The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom, I missed a penalty and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinícius Júnior suspended, Mbappé took the reins and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as Madrid brought the ball out from the back and worked it to Rodrygo on the left flank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian squared to Mbappé on the edge of the area, who took one touch to control, another to set himself and with his third, smashed a fierce effort past the helpless Álvaro Fernández.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's second, 10 minutes later, was even better, with Valverde firing a screamer into the top corner from over 30 yards out after a short corner routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti's side were in full flow and the third followed in the 34th minute when Lucas Vázquez crossed for Rodrygo, who finished with aplomb. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joao Fonseca became the second youngest champion of the NextGen ATP tournament on Sunday when he defied his lowly ranking of 145 to defeat Learner Tien in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Fonseca, 18, came through 2-4, 4-3 (10/8), 4-0, 4-2 to see off his left-handed American opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the youngest champion at the event since current world number one Jannik Sinner claimed the title also at the age of 18 five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult," Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with tennis legend Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a final against Learner in juniors at the 2023 US Open and I know the way he can play," he added. "He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca, the lowest-ranked player in the eight-man field, won all five matches he played this week at the Red Sea venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began the year ranked at 730 in the world and having made a maiden ATP quarter-final in Rio this year, he will be aiming to make significant progress in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to believe when I go before a tournament that I can win," Fonseca said. "But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool swept four points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah's masterclass inspired a memorable 6-3 rout of Tottenham, while Manchester United crashed to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah delivered a sublime performance featuring two goals and a pair of assists as Arne Slot's side ran riot in north London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old is now Liverpool's fourth top scorer ever with 229 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's brace took him past Billy Liddell, with only Ian Rush (346), Roger Hunt (285) and Gordon Hodgson (241) ahead of him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds have won 21 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Slot and have a game in hand on Chelsea to strengthen their lead in the title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a remarkable display of Liverpool's firepower as Luis Díaz and Alexis Mac Allister scored to put them in command.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 60 minutes we did everything we had to do, we were comfortable and good with the ball – the main thing is we worked very hard," Slot said. "But you have to be on top of your game for the whole game and we didn't do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke scored for Tottenham, but an eighth league defeat this season leaves them languishing in 11th place as the pressure mounts on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you want to discount the fact we're missing a goalkeeper, two centre-backs and a left-back and that hasn't coincided with how we're doing – I don't know what to say anymore," Postecoglou said of his critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim, who once again left Marcus Rashford out of his squad, is set for a miserable Christmas following the worst result of his brief reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Languishing in 13th place, United have suffered four defeats in nine matches in all competitions since Amorim arrived from Sporting Lisbon in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's second successive loss after their League Cup exit at Tottenham on Thursday underlined Amorim's belief that their road back to the top will be long and arduous.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who have conceded first in their last six games, were booed off at half-time, while the final whistle was greeted by more jeers from the few fans who stayed until the bitter end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous – I felt it in the stadium," Amorim said. "We have to suffer again, but we will try to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's decision to play without Rashford for the third consecutive game will face fresh scrutiny after United's wretched performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim surprisingly omitted the 27-year-old England forward from the squad for United's win at Manchester City last weekend, prompting Rashford to hint he was willing to leave the club for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford was at Old Trafford wearing a United tracksuit amid his extended exile, as Amorim made six changes from the line-up beaten 4-3 by Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese world number five Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the season-opening United Cup on Sunday citing the need for more rest, but plans to be at the Australian Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old is coming off a breakthrough season that reaped three singles titles, with the highlight winning Olympic gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also made her first Grand Slam final, at Melbourne Park, losing in straight sets to current world number one Aryna Sabalenka on the back of playing the mixed-teams United Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng has opted for more rest this time ahead of the season-opening major from January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the long season that 2024 was for me, I need a few extra weeks of rest, recovery, and good training to get ready for the new season," she wrote on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had such a fantastic time at the United Cup in January of this year, and therefore will miss the event greatly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still, I'm so excited to be back in Australia soon and I will see you all in Melbourne in a couple of weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  China begin their United Cup campaign against Brazil in Perth on Friday, leaving world No.175 Gao Xinyu as their top-ranked woman. (AFP)

    Usyk one of the world's greats after Fury win

<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk reacts after his fight against Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784549_1_20241222081918.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk won his heavyweight championship rematch against Tyson Fury by unanimous decision on Saturday to stay unbeaten across two divisions and underline his right to be counted as one of the all-time greats.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian, who forced the pace and repeatedly tagged Fury with his accurate left hook, was awarded the fight 116-112 by all three judges, handing Fury his second straight loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usyk's win takes him to 23-0 with 14 knockouts and extends one of the all-time best careers that includes Olympic gold and undisputed champion at cruiserweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great fighter, it's a great performance," Usyk, 37, said of Fury, who was unbeaten over 35 fights until he lost their four-belt unification bout in May. "Unbelievable 24 rounds for my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the WBA, WBO and WBC belts were on the line this time after Usyk, focused on the lucrative rematch, relinquished his IBF title rather than face challenger Daniel Dubois.
  <br>
  <br>
  By beating Fury seven months ago, "The Cat" had already joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight, and the first of the four-belt era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat opens up an uncertain future for the 36-year-old Fury, now 34-2-1, who announced his retirement in 2022 only to change his mind and return to the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury, wearing a Santa-style red-and-white robe and bushy beard, appeared to Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You", before a determined-looking Usyk strode out in Cossack gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 6ft 9ins (206cm) Briton's jab held Usyk at bay early on and he landed a jarring right in round two. Usyk caught Fury flush with a left as he raised the pace in round three.
  <br>
  <br>
  They went toe-to-toe in a punishing fifth round, with Fury pummelling body shots while Usyk launched a flurry to the head. In the sixth, he stung Fury with a clean shot to the nose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supremely fit Usyk, renowned for taking charge in the closing rounds, was the aggressor in the seventh, tagging Fury with a hook as the "Gypsy King" backed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury regained the initiative in the ninth, wielding his jab and one-two combinations and leaning on the Ukrainian, utilising his career-heaviest 281lb (127.4kg) of weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was see-saw stuff as they traded blows but Usyk rocked Fury in the 11th with a lightning combination that ended with yet another left hook to the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Usyk uppercut to Fury's chin highlighted a furious final round and there was little doubt about the winner as the Ukrainian sank to his knees, arms aloft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports put the prize purse at US$190 million, with Usyk, as defending champion, expected to receive the bigger share -- a reversal of fortunes from May.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight sits high in the portfolio of Saudi Arabia's oil-funded push into sports, which has drawn accusations of "sportswashing" its dubious human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Formula One, the LIV Golf tour, Newcastle United and a swathe of ageing football stars, the kingdom's strategy confirmed its crowning moment this month when it was awarded football's 2034 World Cup. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to their ninth defeat in 12 matches at Aston Villa on Saturday as Arsenal dismantled Crystal Palace 5-1 to reignite their Premier League title charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest stormed Brentford's fortress to briefly climb to third in the table and Alexander Isak scored his first hat-trick in the English top flight as Newcastle ran riot at Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola -- in the worst spell of his managerial career -- made multiple changes following last week's painful derby defeat to Manchester United but it was to no avail as his injury-hit side lost 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season to put Villa ahead in the 16th minute and Morgan Rogers doubled the advantage for the impressive home side in the 65th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden scored his first top-flight goal of the season in stoppage time but it proved too little too late for the flailing champions, whose spark has vanished.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost six Premier League games in the current campaign, twice as many as they suffered during the whole of last season, when they were crowned champions for the fourth time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola said he trusted his players to turn things around despite their shocking run of just one win from their past 12 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys," he told the BBC. "Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bullish Mikel Arteta said Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, are now firmly in the title picture after his team's thumping win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, scored two more against the same opponents and there were also goals for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and substitute Declan Rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third-placed Gunners are just three points behind Liverpool, who are in action at Tottenham on Sunday, but Arne Slot's men have played two games fewer. Chelsea are in second spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one stage earlier this month Liverpool had a yawning nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not even halfway so we're going to try and set something. For us it's on," Arteta told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to enjoy Christmas with my family because when you win it's always better," added the Spaniard, whose side have finished as Premier League runners-up for the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest won their third consecutive Premier League match to keep up their push for European football, condemning Brentford to their first home defeat this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ola Aina slotted home the opener towards the end of the first half and Anthony Elanga made it 2-0 early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's about enjoying the moment," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "It's a very hard competition. Every game is so difficult and the next one is going to be very tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very proud of all the things we've been able to achieve, but we've achieved nothing yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle deepened Ipswich's plight and lifted themselves to seventh in the table with a 4-0 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak volleyed Eddie Howe's team ahead in the first minute and Jacob Murphy doubled Newcastle's lead before Isak side-footed in from close range just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden international scored his third nine minutes into the second half, poking the ball home after more fine work from Murphy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a ninth defeat in 17 games for Ipswich since they returned to the Premier League and they remain in the relegation zone, two points from safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mats Wieffer gave Brighton a 51st-minute lead against West Ham at the London Stadium but Mohammed Kudus equalised seven minutes later and the match finished 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Away from Saturday's action, Premier League basement club Southampton named former Roma and Torino boss Ivan Juric as their new manager, replacing the sacked Russell Martin. (AFP)

<img alt="George Eastham, (front centre), was part of Alf Ramsey's squad that lifted the World Cup in 1966. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784515_1_20241221190714.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 George Eastham, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, has died at the age of 88, his former club Stoke City announced on their website on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eastham, whose father also named George once played for England, won 19 caps for his country between 1963 and 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not play in England's 1966 campaign on home soil but the Blackpool-born winger was part of Alf Ramsey's squad that lifted the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham made 124 and 207 league appearances for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively before moving to Stoke in 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years earlier he had been involved in a court case against the so-called 'slavery contracts' which improved players' freedom to move between clubs and duly reformed the British transfer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Stoke City Football Club family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88," his former club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham represented the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley," said Stoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  After retiring, Eastham tried his hand at management, taking charge of Stoke for a short spell in the late 1970s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later emigrated to South Africa where he was a football coach for local black children. (AFP)

<img alt="A meet-and-greet session with veteran La Liga legends has reportedly disappointed some Real Madrid fans. Photo courtesy of World Football Legends" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784516_1_20241221191605.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

    Cavaliers ease past Bucks, Embiid shines in Sixers win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers delivered a reality check to newly crowned NBA Cup champions Milwaukee on Friday, dominating the Bucks 124-101 to push their league-best record to 24-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Darius Garland added 16 for the Cavs, who led by as many as 36 points as the Bucks struggled in the absence of injured guard Damian Lillard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks to victory in the NBA Cup final against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, scored 33 points with 14 rebounds and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, back from illness, scored 14 points off the bench for Milwaukee, but starting guards Andre Jackson Jr and AJ Green were a combined 0-for-9 from the field, neither contributing a point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, winners of seven of their last eight, improved to 15-1 at home and got good news with the season debut of Max Strus – who had been sidelined with hip and ankle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strus scored nine points in 19:07 minutes off the bench for Cleveland and drilled three of their 20 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on both ends of the floor," Mitchell said. "We set the tone, offensively, defensively. Knowing they had a long trip back (we were) trying to get going early, push the pace, and we did it for 48 minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who had called it "weird" to pick up regular-season action after playing the semi-finals and final of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas, said the game was not a good gauge of where the Bucks are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat, tired, whatever you want to call it," Rivers said. "There's no read on tonight's game... give them all the credit."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Philadelphia, the 76ers' star center Joel Embiid wore a protective mask as he returned after missing one game because of a sinus fracture to score 34 points in a 108-98 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid, who had been expected to sit out at least through Saturday after taking an inadvertent blow to the face last week, added five rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 23 points and Kelly Oubre Jr added 22 for Philadelphia, who notched their fourth win in five games as they try to climb into the race for a play-in berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid has been largely absent from the Sixers' stuttering season. The 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player was appearing in just his seventh game of the campaign after his troublesome left knee delayed his season debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oklahoma City Thunder, who fell to the Bucks in the Cup final on Tuesday, notched their second victory since then, beating the Heat 104-97 in Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Williams scored 33 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 25 for the Thunder, who were coming off a victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Heat, but Miami clearly missed the contribution of star forward Jimmy Butler, who departed in the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's Bam Adebayo departed briefly in the third quarter after taking an accidental elbow over his left eye. He returned after receiving seven stitches and finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. (AFP)

 Football fans were treated to a nostalgic evening as former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars faced off in a highly anticipated exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game brought together veteran players from the two iconic clubs, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos for Real Madrid, and Thierry Henry and Xavi Hernández for Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s good to see the players,” said football enthusiast Mike.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people that are here are really enjoying themselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Many fans attended the game to watch their favourite players in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benjamin, a French native, was excited to see a legend from his home country grace the field again.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I [used to] only see Thierry Henry on TV,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it was an opportunity to see the legendary player [in person].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid supporter Carlos shared similar sentiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was really nice [to see Luis Figo play in person]. I saw him 10 years ago back in Madrid, and to see him play here is really nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match ended in a one-sided 5-2 victory for Barcelona. But for many of the spectators, being able to witness the historic rivalry was what mattered most.

    English Rugby Union chairman quits amid pay row

<img alt="Tom Ilube had been facing calls for his removal after a grassroots revolt. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784410_1_20241220203617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby Football Union chairman Tom Ilube has stepped down amid a row over the scale of the governing body's executive bonuses, saying the issue had become a "distraction."
 <br>
  <br>
  The move on Friday follows an outcry over RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney's paycheck of £1.1 million (US$1.37 million) for the 2023/24 financial year, which included a bonus of £358,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported that Bill Beaumont, who held the role from 2012 to 2016 and in November stepped down as World Rugby chairman, is being lined up to fill the position on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game, but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place," Ilube said in a statement issued by the RFU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RFU, which held an emergency council meeting on Wednesday, has announced an independent review of its executive pay scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube had been facing motions calling for his removal after a grassroots revolt gathered enough support to trigger a special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed," said Ilube's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the game are furious at the amount earned by Sweeney given the RFU reported an operating loss of £37.9 million for the same period, the highest it has ever recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 42 staff were made redundant in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the pitch, the England men's team won just five of their 12 matches in 2024 and grassroots participation is in decline.

  Sweeney's position is also under threat, with a motion for the RFU board to dismiss him set to be tabled at the forthcoming special general meeting.

  Ilube was head of the remuneration committee that signed off the long-term incentive plan that is the basis for the bonuses awarded to Sweeney and other executives. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wolverhampton Wanderers announced Thursday they had appointed Vitor Pereira as their new head coach as they battle for Premier League survival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old Portuguese manager has left Saudi Pro League club Al Shabab to join Wolves on an 18-month contract after the Midlands side, battling to avoid relegation, sacked Gary O'Neil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely travelled Pereira was close to replacing Rafael Benitez as Everton manager in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an extensive managerial career, Pereira has won two Primeira Liga titles with Porto and the Greek Super League with Olympiakos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported Tuesday that Wolves would pay around US$1 million to bring Pereira to the English top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to welcome Vitor Pereira to Wolves as the new head coach of our men's first-team," Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Vitor is a highly respected and experienced coach who has achieved success across different leagues, and will bring a new approach for the test ahead," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a challenging moment for the club, and we want to thank Vitor for taking on this responsibility. We have full confidence in his ability to guide us back on track, alongside the players and staff, and the entire club will be united in supporting him to achieve success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves, second bottom in the Premier League, said Pereira took his first training session with the club on Thursday and would be in charge for their match away to fellow relegation candidates Leicester – five points above them in the standings – on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was sacked after Saturday's 2-1 loss at home to Ipswich, the club's fourth defeat in a row, left Wolves with just nine points from 16 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was appointed in August 2023, following the departure of Julen Lopetegui and signed a new four-year deal with the club in August this year. (AFP)

    US-based Friedkin Group completes Everton takeover

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US-based Friedkin Group has completed the takeover of Premier League strugglers Everton, ending a turbulent period for the club under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri.
 <br>
  <br>
  Everton have been acquired by Roundhouse Capital Holdings Limited, an entity within the Friedkin Group (TFG), the club announced on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League said TFG had purchased a 98.8 percent stake in Everton, which becomes the 10th English top-flight club under majority American ownership – a list that includes Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in September that TFG had agreed to buy Moshiri's majority stake subject to regulatory approval, which has now been granted by the Premier League, Women's Professional Leagues Limited, the Football Association and the Financial Conduct Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported that TFG's deal to buy Everton was worth more than US$500 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Texas-based group is led by chairman Dan Friedkin and also owns Italian Serie A club Roma. Friedkin has a net worth of US$7.7 billion, according to Forbes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take immense pride in welcoming one of England's most historic football clubs to our global family, the Friedkin Group," Friedkin said in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming executive chairman Marc Watts said "providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority".
  <br>
  <br>
  "While restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Iranian businessman Moshiri, who bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016, welcomed the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I truly believe that the transaction with the Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  American investment firm 777 Partners were unable to complete a deal earlier this year while John Textor, who has a share in Crystal Palace, had previously been in the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have twice been sanctioned under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules in the past 13 months, and had eight points in total deducted last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club have been ever present in the English top flight for the past 70 years but have flirted with relegation in recent seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are currently 16th in the Premier League table, just three points above the relegation zone.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton, while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rare goals from Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Núñez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Núñez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliott doubled Liverpool in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game, after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham. (AFP)

    Pérez, Red Bull part ways after season of struggles

<img alt="Red Bull's Sergio Pérez at the qualifying session of the 2024 Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784099_1_20241219064142.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull announced Wednesday that under-pressure Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has departed the Formula One outfit after four seasons, with Liam Lawson tipped to become world champion Max Verstappen's new teammate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pérez, 34, joined Red Bull in 2021 and helped the team earn two constructors' titles and completed a drivers' standings one-two with four-time world champion Verstappen in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won five Grands Prix over 90 starts in Red Bull colours, including a victory at the Monaco GP and a double in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 season, Pérez and Red Bull signed a contract extension, tying the pair together until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Guadalajara-native's form dropped drastically after that deal and he picked up just nine points from his final eight race weekends.
  <br>
  <br>
  This dip in form led to rumours about his future in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came eighth in the drivers' standings as Red Bull surrendered their team title to McLaren with a third-placed finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pérez was adamant during his difficult period that he would stay with the team for next season but he will now part ways with Red Bull with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Pérez said. "Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together."
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran will not have a seat on the grid next season, but it remains to be seen whether he will sign a deal elsewhere for 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We'll meet again soon. And remember – never give up," Pérez added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen hailed his former teammate on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an absolute pleasure driving alongside you", the Dutchman wrote. "We've had some amazing moments together that I'll always remember. Thank you, Checo [Pérez]!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull said that "announcements regarding the team's full 2025 line-up will be made in due course".
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealander Lawson, who currently drives for Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls, is considered the favourite to replace Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old has earned three top-10 finishes so far in his fledgling F1 career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank Checo for all he has done for Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first 1-2 finish in the drivers' championship," the statement went on to read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo." (AFP)

    Real Madrid sink Pachuca to claim Intercontinental Cup

<img alt="Real Madrid on the pitch after winning the Intercontinental Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784093_1_20241219053405.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  France striker Mbappé returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the Fifa Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for Concacaf Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vázquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is Madrid's second title of the season following their Uefa Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Muñoz for the most in club history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased, very happy. It's a success – that's more than anyone else," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the first edition of the Fifa-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year. They will return to the Middle East in early January for the four-team Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. (AFP)

 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

    Giannis stars as Bucks beat Thunder to win NBA Cup

<img alt="Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with a triple-double in the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783979_1_20241218123712.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks silenced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second half to win the second edition of the NBA Cup with a 97-81 victory in Las Vegas on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo delivered a triple-double of 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists along with two steals and three blocked shots for the Bucks, who drilled 17 three-pointers to complete an unbeaten run and follow in the footsteps of the Los Angeles Lakers as in-season tournament champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard scored 23 points for the Bucks, who held the potentially explosive Thunder offense to 31 points in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's who we are," Antetokounmpo said of the Bucks' second-half surge, which saw them push a one-point lead at halftime to as many as 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points and Jalen Williams added 18 but, with the Bucks thwarting them inside, Oklahoma City were ultimately doomed by their poor long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The triumph was a vindication for the Bucks, who were stung by the Indiana Pacers in last year's Cup semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were the only team from last season's semis to make it back to the final four in Vegas, beating the Orlando Magic in the quarter-finals and dispatching Atlanta in the semis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their Cup success has been part of a massive turnaround after a dismal 2-8 start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have now won 13 of their last 16 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the rest of the Cup matches, the final doesn't count toward the regular-season record, nor do the players' performances count in their career stats.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trophy does come with a financial reward with each player on the winning team set to pocket more than US$514,971 – a significant chunk of money for the younger players and lesser lights on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder players will take home US$205,988 apiece for the runner-up finish. (AFP)

    Vinicius, Bonmatí named Fifa best players of the year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid attacker Vinicius Junior won the Fifa men's player of the year award at a ceremony in Doha on Tuesday, while Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmatí picked up the women's prize for the second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The award comes two months after 24-year-old Vinicius was second in the Ballon d'Or, with Real electing to snub the ceremony when they found out beforehand that Manchester City midfielder Rodri was set to win the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Brazilian was this time on hand to collect the prize in person as he is in Qatar with his club ahead of their Intercontinental Cup final clash with Mexico's Pachuca.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you very much. I don't know where to start," Vinicius said on stage. "It was impossible to think of getting here. I grew up in a world of poverty, of organised crime. It's for all the children who grow up in that world – I thank everyone who voted for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to my family, to the club, to my teammates, to Carletto [Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti], who always helps me," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to everyone who helped make my dream come true. I hope to be at Madrid for many years, because it is the best club in the world," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to Flamengo, my first club in Brazil, and to my teammates in my national team and country who always support my work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius succeeds Lionel Messi as the Fifa men's player, after the Argentinian scooped up the last two editions of the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live wire forward scored 24 goals and laid on 11 assists in 39 matches across all competitions as he led Real to a La Liga and Champions League double last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spain's Bonmatí picked up the women's player award for the second year running, adding to the two Ballon d'Or trophies she already boasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful, I'm proud to receive this award," Bonmatí said via video link from Barcelona's Olympic stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last term, Bonmatí led Barcelona to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claimed the Nations League with her national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  She won every trophy available to her in club football in the 2023 to 2024 season – the Spanish league, the Copa de la Reina, the Supercopa de España and a second-successive Women's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmatí scored a goal and put in a player-of-the-match performance, as Barcelona beat Lyon 2-0 in the final of the Champions League to claim their third title in four seasons. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China have booked a place in the finals of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship in South Korea next year after they crushed Guam in the finale of the qualifying round of the tournament, which the city hosted this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal in each half from Tai Po midfielder Philip Chan, as well as strikes from Benavides Medeiros, Everton Camargo and Dudu, helped seal the 5-0 victory at Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a perfect run in the preliminary competition, with the hosts having beaten Mongolia and Chinese Taipei in their previous matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the sixth straight win under head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR can now look forward to the EAFF E-1 finals in July 2025, when they will face Asian powerhouses South Korea, Japan and China.

    US players to be paid for competing at 2025 Ryder Cup

<img alt="Each member of Team USA is set to receive a US$200,000 stipend. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783776_1_20241217074639.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfers will be paid to play in the Ryder Cup for the first time after the PGA of America unveiled a program on Monday that will give each team member a US$200,000 stipend and US$300,000 to distribute to charity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The program will take effect with the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America said in a statement that its board of directors had voted on the move, which increases the US$200,000 that has been given to each player to distribute to the charities of his choice since the 1999 edition of the biennial match play showdown with Europe was held at Brookline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America added that no players had asked to be compensated, but the issue of pay for play in the prestigious event has reportedly been a source of tension within the US team in previous editions.
  <br>
  <br>
  USA Today newspaper cited a letter to past Ryder Cup captains from PGA of American president Don Rea, who said the stipend was added "out of respect for the players" and would be separate from what players receive for expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's recognition for all the players have done for the Ryder Cup over the years," Rea wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  When reports of compensation for US players surfaced last month, longtime European Ryder Cup stars Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy said they did not need financial incentives to give their all in the often emotional competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for us, we play for the badge and we also play for the European Tour," Rose said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Bethpage Black next year Europe will be defending the title they won in Italy in 2023, but they will be chasing their first victory in the event on US soil since the famous "Miracle at Medinah" in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players on the European Ryder Cup Team do not get paid for participating in the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament is scheduled for September 26 to 28, when the Americans will try to reclaim the trophy from Europe. (AFP/Reuters)

    Unal last-gasp denies West Ham at Bournemouth

<img alt="Bournemouth midfielder Enes Unal celebrates after scoring to draw level. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783775_1_20241217073802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bournemouth's Enes Unal provided a dramatic climax to his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday as the Turkey forward's superb late free-kick cancelled out Lucas Paquetá's penalty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paquetá looked to have sealed West Ham's second successive Premier League victory when he converted from the spot with just three minutes left at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unal came to the Cherries' rescue three minutes later with only his second goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old's moment of magic extended Bournemouth's unbeaten run to four games as they climbed to sixth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enes scored an amazing goal – he's a specialist. But it's only one point. I'm very disappointed with the penalty," Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said of the decision that went against his team for Tyler Adams' handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a play we analysed at a meeting before the season," he added. "The refereeing chiefs said players don't need to defend with hands behind their back in an unnatural position. It didn't affect the direction of the cross – I don't care about the explanation now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth have scored a league-high 10 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of those goals came in a remarkable 2-1 win at Ipswich in their previous game, with Unal also scoring Bournemouth's equaliser on that occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham have gone two games without defeat to ease a little of the pressure on boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suffered a little bit and overcame this to score, but it was an incredible goal from Unal. It's a pity," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are positives," he added. "This is the first step to be strong and a better team."
  <br>
  <br>
  They remain in 14th place and sit seven points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European champions England will renew their rivalry with France and the Netherlands, and also clash with debutants Wales in the group stage of the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament after the draw was made in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br>
  World Cup winners Spain, second in the Fifa rankings and hungry to claim a first Euro title, should have an easier path against Group B opponents Portugal, Belgium and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight-times European champions Germany, who are ranked third in the world, are in Group C with Poland, Denmark and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hosts Switzerland will play Norway, Iceland and Finland in Group A and will kick off the tournament on July 2 against the Norwegians in Basel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being holders, Sarina Wiegman's England team were placed in Pot 2 of the draw after finishing second behind France by a point in their Euro qualifying group, with the two teams splitting their qualifying games with identical 2-1 scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  England face France in their group opener on July 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding more drama to what should be a blockbuster group stage, familiar foes the Netherlands – Wiegman's home country and former team – kept the Lionesses out of the Paris Olympics by finishing ahead of them in the Nations League. The two teams will meet on July 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen delivered another barnstorming performance with two rushing touchdowns, as the Buffalo Bills handed the Detroit Lions only their second defeat of the season with a 48-42 NFL victory at Ford Field on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blockbuster clash between the two high-scoring potential Super Bowl contenders did not disappoint, with Bills quarterback Allen once again underscoring his credentials as the front-runner for this season's Most Valuable Player award.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who rushed for three touchdowns and threw three more in Buffalo's defeat to the Los Angeles Rams last week, was in commanding form with 362 passing yards from 23-of-34 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bills running back James Cook also played a key role with two touchdowns and 105 rushing yards, which included one 41-yard sprint to the end zone in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Buffalo were always in control after racing into an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Detroit's offence kept the Lions in touch – with quarterback Jared Goff throwing five touchdowns and 494 passing yards in a game that saw the two teams combine for nearly 1,100 yards of offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills improved to 11-3 with the win, while Detroit fell to 12-2 to leave the Lions tied in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles – who defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for 290 yards with two touchdowns, and rushed for one more to set up the Philadelphia win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for two touchdowns but suffered a late injury scare as Kansas City eased to a 21-7 win over the Cleveland Browns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes limped off the field midway through the fourth quarter of a win that leaves Kansas City on 13-1, putting them on course to secure post-season home-field advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes was uncertain as to the severity of the injury but said he could have played on if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually you have to wait until the day after to get a good sense of it," Mahomes said. "I could have finished the game in different circumstances." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United scored two late goals to deepen the pain for beleaguered Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, as Chelsea moved just two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on a day of high drama in the English top flight, Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and Southampton boss Russell Martin were both sacked, paying the price for their teams' struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the marquee game of the day at the Etihad, City defender Josko Gvardiol opened the scoring, but Bruno Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot in the 88th minute and Amad Diallo struck two minutes later to seal a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions City – who have dominated English football over the past decade – now have just one win in 11 games in all competitions and Guardiola is desperately searching for answers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a defence, I'm the boss, I'm the manager – I have to find a solution, and I don't find a solution," said the Catalan after the low-quality encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a big club, when you lose eight out of 11, something wrong is happening," he added. "What can I say? The schedule is tough, the injured players? No. I'm the boss, I'm the manager and I'm not good enough – it's as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men trail leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand, by nine points and sit outside the Champions League places, in fifth spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-ravaged City were far from their best at the Etihad but appeared to be on course for a vital win as the clock ticked down against their neighbours before they self-imploded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Nunes' sloppy back pass was cut out by Diallo and the Portuguese midfielder then chopped down the United winger in his attempt to make amends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes coolly converted from the penalty spot to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo then raced onto a simple long ball over the top of City's flat-footed defence, finishing neatly to complete a remarkable turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win is a huge relief for new United boss Ruben Amorim, who had won just one of his first four Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for the fans it has a deep meaning, especially in this context, in this moment," the former Sporting Lisbon boss said after his first experience of a Manchester derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a difficult moment one week ago against Nottingham Forest at home with a storm," he added. "It was a really tough moment after the game. Today, we are more happy, but it's three points that we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  United finished the day 13th in the Premier League table – where they started – after Tottenham hammered bottom club Southampton 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca's high-flying Chelsea beat Brentford 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to close to within two points of long-time leaders Liverpool, who have 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home team dominated the first half and got the reward they deserved shortly before the break when Marc Cucurella nodded home Noni Madueke's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson doubled Chelsea's lead in the 80th minute and they held out for the win despite a late strike from prolific Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a fifth straight win for Chelsea, who look increasingly like being Liverpool's main challengers this season, with Arsenal and City faltering. (AFP)

    Haughey claims 5th world title with 200m freestyle win

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday posted the third-fastest time ever recorded for the women’s 200-metre freestyle event, clocking in a time of one minute and 50.62 seconds to capture gold at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, finished nearly a second faster than Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey, who clocked in a time of one minute and 51.49 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Claire Weinstein rounded out the podium to take bronze with her one-minute-51.62 second performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey's result stands just behind only her world record, set in 2021 in Abu Dhabi, and Swedish Sarah Sjostrom‘s one minute and 50.43 from 2017. She now owns four of the five fastest times in event history.
  <br>
  <br>
  With that result, the four-time Olympic medallist for the SAR now has four 200-metre freestyle world crowns – along with one other in the 100-metre event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey had recently announced she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England were placed in a group with Serbia as the draw for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Europe took place on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As they prepare to begin life under new coach Thomas Tuchel, England were also drawn alongside Albania, Latvia and Andorra in the five-team Group K.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matches will take place between March and November next year, with the group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runners-up in each of the 12 qualifying groups will get a second chance via a series of play-offs, with Europe now contributing a total of 16 nations to the expanded 48-team competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact make-up of the groups is not yet completely clear as it depends on the outcome of the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties will see reigning European champions Spain face the Netherlands, while Germany play Italy, Portugal take on Denmark and France meet Croatia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups in which these teams end up depend on whether they win and progress to the Nations League semi-finals next June, or are eliminated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are six groups of five teams who will begin qualifying in March, while the six groups of four teams will only start next September. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton stars Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet on Friday crashed out of the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, falling to the national team's Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin in three games.
 <br>
  <br>
  That result could be the end of the road for the SAR pair, with Tse having already hinted at retirement earlier this year as she continues to battle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei pulled ahead late to win the opening game, 21-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Tang and Tse to bounce back, though, claiming a nail-biting 21-19 victory in the second to force a winner-take-all third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by six at the break, the SAR pair put up a fight by scoring six straight points to cut the deficit at 14-11.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jiang and Wei pulled away to seal a 21-15 victory to round out the 63 minute match-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong duo finished group play with one win and two losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei will join compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in the knockout round, which begins on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest chess world champion on Thursday after beating defending champion Ding Liren of China in the final match of their series in Singapore.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju, 18, secured 7.5 points against 6.5 of his Chinese rival in the contest, surpassing the achievement of Russia’s Garry Kasparov who won the title at the age of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian teen prodigy has long been considered a rising star in the chess world after he became a chess grandmaster at 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had entered the match as the youngest-ever challenger to the world crown after winning the Candidates tournament earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After securing victory, Dommaraju burst into tears and raised his arms in celebration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years. I am happy that I realised the dream (and made it) into reality,” he told reporters after his win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju is now the second Indian to win the title after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand, who has been a mentor to Dommaraju, said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the 18-year-old on his “remarkable accomplishment,” calling it “the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s match was a 14-round long-time classical event with a prize fund of US$2.5 million. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City captain Kyle Walker has called for tough action to tackle online abuse after he received a "vile, racist and threatening" message following Wednesday's 2-0 loss at Juventus.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walker played the whole European Champions League match in Turin but could not help Pep Guardiola's team avoid a seventh defeat in 10 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international posted a screenshot of a message he received on Instagram from an unnamed user to his social media accounts on Thursday that used obscene racist language.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one should ever be subjected to the sort of vile, racist and threatening abuse I have received online since last night's match," Walker wrote on his X and Instagram accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instagram and the authorities need to stop this happening for the sake of all who are suffering this abuse – it is never acceptable," he went on to say. "To our fans, we will continue to work as a team to do better, to improve and to turn the corner together."
  <br>
  <br>
  City condemned the racist attack. A club statement read: "Manchester City strongly condemns the racist abuse that Kyle Walker was subject to online following last night's fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We refuse to tolerate discrimination of any kind – regardless of whether that be in stadiums or online," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League also weighed in, saying in a statement that "racism has no place in the game or anywhere in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage anyone who hears or sees discriminatory abuse to report it so action can be taken," it wrote. "The Premier League will support Kyle Walker and the club to tackle online hate." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund fired Manchester United to a 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League as Chelsea beat Astana 3-1 in the Europa Conference League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's United side came from behind to best the Czech side thanks to a second-half brace by Danish striker Hojlund, provisionally moving to fifth in the league phase standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top eight finish will see United qualify automatically for the round of 16, while finishing ninth to 24th will earn them a play-off tie to reach that stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matej Vydra opened the scoring three minutes after half-time to stun United, before substitute Hojlund scored twice in the last half-hour to seize a vital three points for the English club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner came two minutes from time when Bruno Fernandes cleverly slipped a free-kick into the 21-year-old's feet and he held off a defender before slipping home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Europa League, Roma beat 10-man Braga 3-0 thanks to goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Saud Abdulhamid and Mario Hermoso to move to 12th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic Bilbao top the standings with 16 points after beating Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 2-0 on Wednesday courtesy of an Inaki Williams double.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a much-changed Chelsea side battled the frigid conditions in Kazakhstan and won to all but guarantee a top-eight finish in the league phase, which would ensure automatic qualification to the round of 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a solid performance," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. "We knew it was quite cold – we tried to adapt quickly. The players did fantastically with the weather conditions and long journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea sit top of the standings on 15 points, three ahead of Fiorentina in second and Legia Warsaw who lost to Switzerland's Lugano to break their perfect record in the competition. (AFP)

 Swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Friday finished fourth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong swimmer finished her two laps with a time of 51.41 seconds, more than a full second behind first-place American Gretchen Walsh who took gold with a 50.31-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beryl Gastaldello of France clocked in a time of 50.63 seconds for the silver medal, while 14-time Championships medallist Kate Douglass claimed bronze at 50.73 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, qualified for the final after coming in fifth overall in yesterday's semi-finals, where she recorded a time of 51.83 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Haughey is the 200-metre freestyle on Sunday, where she will be looking to defend her title as she competes in what will be one of her last races before going on hiatus.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The captain of Hong Kong, China men's team, James Christie, on Thursday said the squad would be looking to build on their recent success in Asia as they enter the final stretch of training in the run-up to the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having been named as the successor to Max Woodward in September, Christie weighed in on what the opportunity to lead Hong Kong meant to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always said I'm not much of a talker," Christie said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not much difference between being a player and a captain – I need to lead from the front a bit more, but I like to lead through the games and matches that I play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, 28, has already tasted early success in leading the SAR to a clean sweep of victories during the Asia Rugby Sevens Series this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the SAR defeated Japan in the final of the last leg of the tournament in Thailand, repeating its earlier successes in China and South Korea, to become the first side to win all of its 15 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Christie said the team's eyes are on the bigger prize on home soil, as the annual tournament makes its debut at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge motivation, the new facilities look fantastic," said Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking forward to running out a new spot with a new team and new faces, so hopefully, it'll be all good."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also added that fitness, skills, and cohesion are major aspects that the team are looking to polish up on ahead of the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chloe Chan, the new co-captain of the women's side, said she wants to encourage her teammates on and off the field, to ensure that the team bonds well together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really want our team to come together and perform and do well in the Challenger Series," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for veteran co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne, she said she's looking forward to working with a new partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chloe Chan has actually been on the leadership group for quite a while, so she has stepped up. She's been a leader multiple times before, so I see it going quite smoothly," Olson-Thorne told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She's got a lot of experience and a lot of positivity leading into the team environment."

 The Houston Rockets edged Golden State 91-90 for their first win over the Warriors since 2020, as they reach the semi-finals of the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teammate Jalen Green's 12 points, including the game-winning free-throws with 3.5 seconds remaining, helped Houston end a run of 15 straight losses to the Warriors stretching back to February 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets booked an NBA Cup last-four showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Atlanta Hawks, fueled by 22 points and 11 assists from Trae Young, erased a 10-point third-quarter deficit to beat the New York Knicks 108-100 and book an NBA Cup semi-final against the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hawks point guard Young, the player Knicks fans have loved to hate since Atlanta's 2021 playoff series triumph over New York, came alive in the second half to get the Hawks offense firing after the Knicks dominated the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored 12 points and handed out nine assists after the break, directing a balanced Hawks attack that was led by 24 points from forward De'Andre Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big game, especially for us," Young said after the Hawks punched their ticket to the NBA Cup final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just try to play for each other and play til the end, and that's what we did." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifa on Wednesday confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, underlining the Gulf kingdom's growing influence in world sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, a virtual Congress of world football's governing body confirmed that Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be joint hosts of the 2030 World Cup, in which three games will also be played in South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid was waved through by acclamation during the meeting of Fifa's 211 national member associations, with no rivals standing in its way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a proud day, a day of celebration, a day that we invite the entire world to Saudi Arabia," said Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We intend to have an extraordinary version of the World Cup in our kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to condemnation from rights groups, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said his organisation is inclusive and non-discriminatory. “We want to obtain positive social impact," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of course aware of critics and fears, and I fully trust our hosts to address all open points from this process and deliver a Fifa World Cup which meets expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "social improvements and positive human rights impacts" are "responsibilities of hosting a World Cup". (AFP)

 Hong Kong's star swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Thursday advanced to the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old qualified after finishing fifth overall in the semi-finals, where she clocked a time of 51.83 seconds. American Gretchen Walsh topped the rankings with a 50.49-second finish.

  <br>
  The final round is set to begin at 12.32am on Friday, Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pachuca of Mexico bested Brazilian side Botafogo 3-0 on Wednesday in the Intercontinental Cup to reach the next stage of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half strikes from Pachuca's Oussama Idrissi, Nelson Deossa and Salomón Rondón gave the North American continental champions victory over their South American counterparts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really emotional," said Pachuca coach Guillermo Almada. "It was a party in the stadium with all the supporters from Pachuca and Botafogo that came here – it was a football party."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very happy," he added. "We're already thinking about the next game, which could be even more difficult than this one."
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the all-American clash progress to the next round of the new Intercontinental Cup format, where they will meet CAF Champions League winners Al Ahly of Egypt on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid, the current Uefa Champions League holders, lie in wait in the final four days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pachuca qualified for the tournament as victors of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup – following their 3-0 win in the final against MLS side Columbus Crew in early June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat put a dampener on a brilliant fortnight for Botafogo in which they won the Copa Libertadores and wrapped up the Brazilian Serie A.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't look for an excuse," said Botafogo coach Artur Jorge. "Pachuca were better than us, more efficient and more capable in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old Portuguese guided the Rio club to a first-ever Copa Libertadores and a first domestic league title since 1995 this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't the result we wanted, but we had an extraordinary year, made history," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal midfielder Bukayo Saka celebrates scoring. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783113_1_20241212073858.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka's double fired Arsenal a step closer to the Champions League last 16 as the England forward inspired a 3-0 win against Monaco on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Saka netted late in each half and Kai Havertz struck in the closing minutes at the Emirates Stadium to lift Mikel Arteta's side into third place in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have won four of their six European games this term and, with two matches remaining, they control their destiny in the race for the top-eight finish that guarantees automatic progress to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clubs that finish ninth to 24th in the 36-team first phase face a play-off to determine if they will advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  With games against Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come in January, the north Londoners will be confident of avoiding that unwanted obstacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a damaging 1-1 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Arsenal's fifth win in their last six games in all competitions was a welcome tonic.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Arsenal's defensive injury crisis showing no signs of abating, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ben White, Riccardo Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Takehiro Tomiyasu were all absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey started out of position at right-back despite missing training on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly, 18, came in at left-back for just his second Arsenal start, with his other coming in the League Cup against third-tier Bolton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest player to start a Champions League match for Arsenal since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, Lewis-Skelly rose to the occasion with a composed display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Gabriel Jesus has gone 32 games without a goal for Arsenal and the Brazilian's lack of confidence was clear in the hosts' first dangerous attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Picked out by Gabriel Martinelli's pass, Jesus should have hit the target but could only muster a tame shot straight at Monaco keeper Radoslaw Majecki.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were plunged further into crisis on Wednesday after falling to a 2-0 defeat at Juventus which threatens their chances of reaching the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie were enough for Juve to inflict a seventh defeat in 10 matches on Pep Guardiola's struggling City.
  <br>
  <br>
  English champions City languish in 22nd place in Europe's top club competition, having collected just eight points from their six matches in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  That leaves City just one point above the bottom 12 places and elimination, with matches against Paris Saint-Germain and Club Brugge remaining, a position that would have been unthinkable at the start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City have unravelled in less than six weeks and are way off the pace both in the Premier League and Champions League thanks to just one win, over Nottingham Forest, since the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have the Manchester derby at the weekend, hardly the sort of fixture they need in the midst of this dismal run from.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get points, we'll go to Paris to try and do that and the same goes for the final match at home," said Guardiola to Amazon Prime in Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can get out of this period by playing like we did today. We lost very few balls and I think we played very well... they deserve more because they give everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vlahovic's header, his 10th goal of the season, and substitute McKennie's fine volley with 15 minutes remaining also snapped a frustrating four-match run of draws for Juventus and brightened the mood among fans who have been disappointed with Thiago Motta's opening few months as coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve had drawn 11 of their 20 matches in all competitions coming into Wednesday's match, but a rugged display moved them up to 11 points and ended with fans roaring with joy and colouring the stands of the Allianz Stadium with flag waving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motta's team are level with fellow Serie A outfit Atalanta and two points from the top eight positions which give direct access to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was little suggestion of Juve grabbing such a big result after a very drab opening period in frigid Turin, where two off-form teams ineffectually bumped up against one another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The best chance of the half came five minutes before the break when Michele Di Gregorio did well to charge down Erling Haaland as the Norway striker tried to flick home Kevin De Bruyne's neat through ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve produced even less in front in increasingly frustrated supporters, who only had a Kenan Yildiz pot shot to shout about in a largely dismal opening period for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that all changed in the 53rd minute thanks to Vlahovic just about forcing his close-range header across the line after City goalkeeper Ederson had kept out Federico Gatti's flying volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stunned into action, City pushed for a leveller as Juve retreated into their own box, a move reminiscent of dozens of similarly dogged Italian defensive displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Di Gregorio did brilliantly to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's powerful long-range effort in the 68th minute, seconds before McKennie came on for Khephren Thuram.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American turned out to be an inspired choice as he was on hand, completely unmarked, to lash in countryman Timothy Weah's deftly clipped cross and kill off City's hopes of saving a point. (AFP)

 Hong Kong's superstar swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Wednesday advanced to the 100m freestyle semi-finals at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, in one of her last races before taking a break to ponder her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her time of 52.12 seconds topped her heat, and was good for second overall behind American Gretchen Walsh, who clocked a 51.64-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, was second at the first turn in the short course race and overtook Briton Freya Andersen shortly afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow SAR swimmer Li Sum-yiu, 15, was unable to advance after finishing eighth in the same heat with a time of 53.41 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals are due to begin at 0:48am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200m freestyle title in Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time Olympic medallist for Hong Kong, China recently announced that she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid got their European Champions League title defence back up and running after coming through a tough battle to win 3-2 at Atalanta.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were just enough for Madrid to triumph in a red-hot atmosphere in Bergamo and move up to nine points from six matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side would have been at risk of dropping out of the play-off places but came through a tough test at Serie A leaders Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The away side are now three points from the top eight positions which give direct qualification for the last 16 with two matches remaining in their league campaign and a round of fixtures coming up on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid inflicted on Atalanta a first defeat in this year's revamped competition and are now only two points behind Gian Piero Gasperini's ambitious team who performed well against 15-time European champions Madrid but now sit ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously we're a little disappointed, but we're learning so much from these matches," Gasperini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing tiny details, but we played with heart against great champions," he added. "We were defeated in result, but not in performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atalanta scored through a Charles De Ketelaere penalty which levelled Mbappé's opener in first-half stoppage time and a fine Ademola Lookman strike in the 65th minute which put the hosts back in the match after Vinicius and Bellingham's quickfire goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts even came to within inches of snatching a dramatic draw deep in added time when substitute Retegui somehow shot over Lookman's fizzing cross from from practically on the goalline. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Champions League group phase leaders Liverpool virtually sealed a place in the last 16 with a tight 1-0 victory at Girona after Mohamed Salah struck from the penalty spot.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool have made a stunning start in the competition under coach Arne Slot, winning all six of their matches to move provisionally five points clear of second-placed Inter Milan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English giants, six-time winners of the competition, were given a tough night by Champions League debutants Girona, who fell to a fifth defeat and are on the verge of elimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing in the top eight will avoid an extra round of play-off matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me about all six games, I'm really pleased with all the results – but I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight," Slot told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better but then I'm trying to be positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot started fit-again goalkeeper Alisson Becker after a two-month injury lay-off and the Brazilian showed no sign of rust on a busy night.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their Merseyside derby clash at Everton was called off because of a storm at the weekend, Slot was able to pick a fresh side, going with arguably his strongest available team to try and assure a top eight finish as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcomers Girona, who lost several key players in the summer and are still rebuilding, opted for Arnaut Danjuma in attack with support from spritely duo Bryan Gil and Yaser Asprilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool pinned the hosts back in the first 10 minutes and Girona stopper Paulo Gazzaniga pushed away a Joe Gomez header.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that Michel Sanchez's Girona found their footing on a chilly night at their sold-out Montilivi stadium, reduced to under 10,000 capacity due to UEFA regulations, and they began to put Alisson to the test. (AFP)
