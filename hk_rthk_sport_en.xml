<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will be looking to record their third straight victory under newly-appointed head coach Ashley Westwood as they take on Mauritius on Tuesday in an international football friendly at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  A win over Mauritius could see the 48-year-old Englishman become the first Hong Kong manager since Kim Pan-gon in 2016 to win three consecutive matches, following a pair of convincing showings over Cambodia and the Philippines.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK's Asia football correspondent, Chris KL Lau, says Westwood will look to experiment with his line-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he also acknowledged the challenges of facing a competitive, 178th-ranked Mauritius side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong will want to extend their momentum fresh off their win over the Philippines," Lau noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Westwood may use this game to experiment with his line-up, though fans can expect another entertaining, forward-thinking, and attacking Hong Kong team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mauritius, meanwhile, enter the match-up having recorded away defeats to Syria and India in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avoiding defeat also guarantees Hong Kong a place in pot two for December's AFC Asian Cup qualifying draw, following Singapore's loss to Chinese Taipei.

    Italy eliminate Swiatek's Poland, reach BJK Cup final

<img alt="Swiatek rallied from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779794_1_20241119081949.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy reached a second consecutive Billie Jean King Cup final with a dramatic 2-1 victory over Iga Swiatek's Poland on Monday in Malaga.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Swiatek came from a set down to beat Jasmine Paolini in her singles rubber but the Italian earned immediate revenge over the five-time Grand Slam winner in the deciding doubles clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini and veteran Sara Errani overcame Swiatek and Katarzyna Kawa 7-5, 7-5 in the doubles rubber to send the four-time champions through to Wednesday's final.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening singles rubber, Italy's Lucia Bronzetti dispatched Magda Linette in straight sets 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was followed by Swiatek's three-set battle with Paolini which ran over two-and-a-half hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough today – the intensity was insane, I was a little bit tired but I said to myself, you still have to play the doubles, you have to give everything for Italy, for my team," said Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I lost the singles match I was a little bit sad, but then tried to go in the locker room and think positive about the doubles," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linette, world number 38, was largely outclassed by Bronzetti, ranked 78th, in the first singles rubber.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 4-1 down in the second set, Linette battled back strongly to force a tie-break but was eventually beaten when she slapped a return into the net after saving one match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  It left the pressure on Swiatek to deliver, which she did in thrilling fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten every time in their three prior clashes and having never managed to take a set off Swiatek, Paolini battled with fierce determination from the outset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek crushed the world number four in straight sets in the French Open final earlier this year but found a vastly tougher opponent in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole saved two break points to hold at 2-2 and then broke with a fizzing forehand to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not deter Paolini, who doubled down and won the next four games, securing two breaks of her own, to claim the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek spurned three break points in the final game and showed signs of tiredness after helping Poland reach the semi-finals by winning both her singles match and a doubles rubber against the Czech Republic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini had done the same for last year's runners-up Italy against Japan but dug deep to keep Swiatek at bay until the 10th and final game of the second set, which the Pole won to force a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the players exchanged breaks in the decider, Swiatek eventually triumphed when Paolini went long.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 13 of the 16 break points she faced, proving the stronger in the key moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it was tough, my energy level was down in the second set but I managed to get back and that was the most important thing," said Swiatek, explaining she had "no time to celebrate" as the job was not done yet. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bryan Zaragoza won and converted a late penalty to help Euro 2024 winners Spain beat Switzerland 3-2 in a Uefa Nations League dead rubber on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nations League holders, already guaranteed top spot in Group A4, twice took the lead but were pegged back by the already-relegated Swiss in Tenerife.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first Spain match on the island in 28 years and fans were able to celebrate a win after Bayern Munich winger Zaragoza's late spot-kick settled the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Luis de la Fuente changed his whole line-up from the win over Denmark on Friday, handing Athletic Bilbao centre-back Aitor Paredes his debut in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeremi Pino, a Canary Islander, sent Spain ahead on home territory after 32 minutes after Pedri's penalty was saved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Alvaro Morata won the penalty and handed Pedri, born in Tenerife, the ball to take the spot kick, but Yvon Mvogo saved the Barcelona midfielder's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Here at home with a goal, the win – I can't ask for more," Pino said. "It was a very special game – full marks to the fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  De la Fuente sent on another Spain debutant at half-time in Porto striker Samu Aghehowa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joel Monteiro levelled for Switzerland but a few minutes later Bryan Gil stole the ball back to restore Spain's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andi Zeqiri fired home from the spot after a foul by Fabian Ruiz in the 85th minute but Zaragoza ensured Spain could finish a spectacular year on a high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, on loan at Osasuna from Bayern, burst into the box and was brought crashing down by Vincent Sierro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zaragoza clinically dispatched the resulting penalty to spark jubilant celebrations in Tenerife. (AFP)

    Bentancur gets seven-game ban over alleged racial slur

<img alt="Rodrigo Bentancur has since apologised to South Korean teammate Son Heung-min. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779739_1_20241118195332.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham's Rodrigo Bentancur was on Monday given a seven-match domestic ban by the Football Association over an alleged racist remark made about teammate Son Heung-min in a TV interview.
 <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was charged by the FA in September in connection with an alleged breach of its rules during the interview in his home country of Uruguay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Juventus player, who has also been fined £100,000 (US$126,000), had been asked in June by a presenter for a Spurs player's shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  He replied: "Sonny's? It could be Sonny's cousin too as they all look the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur, 27, apologised to the South Korea international but because it was deemed an "aggravated breach," an independent regulatory commission panel was required to either uphold the FA charge or dismiss the case.
  <br>
  <br>
  The panel upheld the charge and Bentancur will have to sit out Tottenham's next seven domestic fixtures, though he will be able to play in Europa League matches against Roma and Rangers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FA said in a statement that it was alleged that the incident constituted an "aggravated breach... as it included a reference – whether express or implied – to nationality and/or race and/or ethnic origin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rodrigo Bentancur denied this charge, but the independent regulatory commission found it to be proven and imposed his sanctions following a hearing," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son, speaking in late September, said: "He apologised straight afterwards when we had holiday. I was at home. I didn't even realise what was going on. He sent me a long message and you could feel it was coming from his heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou said Bentancur had acknowledged his mistake and had pleaded for leniency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur will not return to domestic action until December 26, missing Premier League matches against Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool as well as Tottenham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Uruguayan has played 15 times for Tottenham this season, scoring one goal. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England blew away 10-man Republic of Ireland 5-0 to wrap up promotion to the Uefa Nations League top flight, as four players netted their first international goals on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Euro 2024 runners-up England secured top spot in Group B2 in interim boss Lee Carsley's final game in charge before the arrival of Thomas Tuchel as manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted the England team to be exciting to watch and be attacking," Carsley said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can only do what I was in control of," he added. "It's not a gamble with some of these players – they are excellent players."
  <br>
  <br>
  England struggled to break down a resolute Ireland in the first half at Wembley, with Noni Madueke twice having efforts blocked after threatening bursts into the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game changed shortly after the interval when Liam Scales brought down Jude Bellingham after a fine pass from Harry Kane, conceding a penalty and being sent off for a second bookable offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane stepped up to slot his spot-kick past Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.
  <br>
  <br>
  England doubled their lead in the 56th minute, as Tino Livramento's deflected cross found its way to his Newcastle teammate Anthony Gordon who volleyed home his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's side scored their third goal in the space of five minutes when Conor Gallagher stabbed in a Marc Guehi flick-on from a corner to also net for the first time for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen joined the party, sweeping home his first England goal with his first touch just seconds after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor Harwood-Bellis, on as a sub for his England debut, headed in Bellingham's cross in the 79th minute to round off the scoring. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers, playing without top scorer Donovan Mitchell, matched the second-best start to a season in NBA history on Sunday, reaching 15-0 with a 128-114 victory over Charlotte.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell took the night off to rest after averaging 24.6 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Cavs during their perfect run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The host Cavaliers, however, made up for his absence with a balanced attack as Darius Garland had 25 points and 12 assists, Ty Jerome added 24 points, Evan Mobley scored 23 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Jarrett Allen contributed 21 points and 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've always got some fight in us no matter what," Garland said. "Everybody is ready to play. It doesn't matter, one through 15."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody contributed," he added. "Everybody had a huge part in this win – that's just us. Just as a team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  Under new coach Kenny Atkinson, the Cavaliers had become the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beating the Hornets made them only the fourth team in NBA history to open 15-0, matching the 1948-49 Washington Capitols and 1993-94 Houston Rockets for the second-best start.
  <br>
  <br>
  They now trail only the record 24-0 start by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win streak is already the longest in the Cavaliers' 55-year history, eclipsing three 13-win runs when LeBron James was with Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball had 31 points and 12 assists in a losing cause. (AFP)

    Bills hand Chiefs first loss of 2024 NFL season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions, suffered their first loss of the NFL season on Sunday, falling 30-21 to the Buffalo Bills after winning their first nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The result ends any talk of the Chiefs matching the 1972 Miami Dolphins team with a perfect, unbeaten season and was another reminder of the class of the Bills and their quarterback, Josh Allen.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Bills leading 23-21, Allen secured the victory in stunning fashion with a 26-yard rush on fourth down and two, demonstrating not only his footwork and speed but also his strength as he broke two tackles to power into the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a man play, they dropped out into zone, they had something good for it," Allen said. "I'm just trying to make a play, help our team win a football game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are some things we want to clean up, some throws I wish I had back," he added. "But we're going into the bye week 9-2 – we'll take it. Knowing how things usually play out, we'll probably see this team again at some point."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Bills have beaten Kansas City in each of the past four NFL seasons, the Chiefs have eliminated the Bills from the playoffs in three of the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills opened a 23-14 lead early in the fourth when Allen found Curtis Samuel with a 12-yard touchdown pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Mahomes responded though, finding Noah Gray with a one-yard pass to make it a two-point game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came Allen's inspired touchdown run, which left Mahomes in need of one of his famous comebacks. But on fourth down, his pass intended for Travis Kelce was intercepted by Buffalo's Terrel Bernard. (AFP)

 Quarterback Jared Goff threw for 412 yards and four touchdowns as the Detroit Lions crushed the struggling Jacksonville Jaguars 52-6.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NFC-leading Lions have won eight straight and nine of their first 10 games in a season for the first time since 1934.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's winning margin of 46 points was the largest in franchise history, and it handed Jacksonville its biggest-ever defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions also set a franchise record in total yards with 645, the third most in the NFL in the past 20 years – while allowing 170 by the Jaguars – a 475-yard margin that was the third largest in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We felt like we could call anything,” Goff said. “Its quite the luxury to have in the NFL to take players out – ever."
  <br>
  <br>
  Running back David Montgomery rushed for two scores for the Lions and put up 75 yards on the ground in what became a rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Jacksonville defence was ineffective against on the ground and in the air, with Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown scoring twice and putting up 161 yards receiving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Steelers continued their domination of AFC North divisional rivals Baltimore Ravens, enjoying an 18-16 win on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Steelers survived a late Baltimore rally as they moved to 8-2 on the season, while the Ravens fall to 7-4 with what was their eighth loss in nine games against Pittsburgh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh managed the win without scoring a touchdown thanks to six field goals from placekicker Chris Boswell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boswell's successful 50-yard kick late in the fourth quarter gave the Steelers an 18-10 lead, but Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson found Zay Flowers with a 16-yard pass in the end zone with just over a minute remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson, however, was unable to make the two-point conversion attempt,  and the Steelers were able to close out the game. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain knocked out defending Billie Jean King Cup champions Canada as singles wins for Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter completed a 2-0 victory in Malaga on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open champion Raducanu powered through the first set of the opening rubber against Rebecca Marino and held off the Canadian in the second set to wrap up a 6-0, 7-5 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu saved seven break points as Marino tried to force a third set, eventually earning a break of her own in the 11th game before closing out the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really pleased with how I managed to step up on those big points, big moments," said the 58th-ranked Raducanu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just need to keep reminding myself those clutch situations is where I really kind of thrive and I really enjoy them for the most part."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 24 Boulter then brushed aside Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-4 to send Britain through to a semi-final against Slovakia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really happy with me level today," said Boulter, who produced another assured display after dropping only three games in her first-round match against Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to say, firstly, Emma makes it very easy to come out here and have a swing a 1-0 up, so full credit to her for starting us off well," she added. "Really proud of my performance today. I just wanted to come out here and really go at the defending champs."
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1981.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slovakia, the 2002 champions, overcame Australia 2-0 earlier in the day to make the last four of the competition for the first time in 11 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viktoria Hruncakova and Rebecca Sramkova both won their singles ties as Slovakia backed up their victory over the United States in the first round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another big country which we beat, and I'm so proud for the girls, for our team members, for our country – because we are a small country," said Slovakia captain Matej Liptak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it really means so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  World number 241 Hruncakova emerged victorious against Kimberly Birrell 7-5, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 after over two-and-a-half hours on court to give the central European country the lead over Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova then needed just over an hour to win 6-1, 6-2 against former world number 32 Ajla Tomljanovic, who injured her knee in the third game of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have nothing to lose. That's why I think we enjoy it so much. We are doing good, and hopefully we're going to keep doing that," said Hruncakova.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek will lead Poland as they take on world number four Jasmine Paolini's Italy in the other semi-final. (AFP)

    Korda wins LPGA Annika for seventh title of the season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda captured her seventh LPGA title of the season and 15th career crown on Sunday, firing a three-under par 67 to win the Annika tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old American, playing her first event since being sidelined by a neck injury last month, reeled off five consecutive back-nine birdies to seize the crown by three strokes at Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After taking some time off with an injury it was great to be back out here," Korda said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's nothing like being in the hunt," she added. "There's nothing like the adrenaline feeling going on the back nine, being in contention – I love it so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Im Jin-hee, China's Zhang Weiwei and England's Charley Hull shared second on 269 with Sweden's Linn Grant and American Rose Zhang sharing fifth on 270.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Korda's third victory in the event after taking the 2021 and 2022 titles and made her the first player since Taiwan's Yani Tseng in 2011 to win seven tournaments in a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annika Sorenstam, the tournament namesake from Sweden, holds the record with 11 titles in the 2002 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is the first American player to win seven LPGA titles in a season since Beth Daniel in 1990 and four of Korda's victories, including Sunday's triumph, came when she trailed entering the final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensured she will be a heavy favorite at next week's season-ending Tour Championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda added to a 2024 LPGA trophy haul that began in January at the Drive On Championship in her hometown of Bradenton, Florida.
  <br>
  <br>
  It continued with wins at the Pak Se-ri Championship in Los Angeles, the Ford Championship and LPGA Match Play ahead of her second major title at the Chevron Championship and the Americas Open in May, her most recent victory until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The neck injury kept Korda from playing in October in Asia and she had not walked a full 18 holes in nearly two months until this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda struggled early with a bogey at the second hole then sandwiched a birdie between bogeys at the sixth and eighth holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that only set the stage for Korda's run of birdies from the 11th through 15th holes, going from two adrift to secure the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not a lot of happy thoughts at the beginning," Korda said. "You should have felt the nerves I was feeling on the back nine." (AFP)

    Sinner defeats Fritz to claim first ATP Finals title

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner won the ATP Finals on Sunday after beating Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 to claim his first title at the season-ending event in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner's triumph on home soil was the latest moment of glory in a near-perfect year in which the 23-year-old won eight tournaments, including his debut Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing, it's my first title in Italy and it means so much to me," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something very special. I just tried to understand what works best for each opponent, trying to play my best possible tennis – that was the key," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner again swept Fritz aside in straight sets just as he did in the group stage and the US Open final in September, improving his record on hard courts this year to 50-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is the first Italian to win the Finals, doing so days after becoming the first from his nation to top the ATP's end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  His Tour-leading 70th win of the season made him the first player since Ivan Lendl in 1986 to win the tournament without dropping a set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to make myself better than last year, to find the keys to win this final. I'm very happy to have handled this pressure and to share this success with the Italian crowd," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went in Sinner's favour after an enthralling seventh game which lasted nine minutes and was eventually won on the fourth break point.
  <br>
  <br>
  And despite Fritz's best efforts he couldn't fight back, failing to get a single break point in the second set and succumbing to his opponent's superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz fell short in his bid to become the event's first American champion since Pete Sampras in 1999 but will rise to a career-best of fourth in the rankings Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the good results, it's been a great week for me," said Fritz, beaten for the fourth time in five meetings with Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Jannik and his team because he plays incredible tennis, really incredible," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has reacted to losing last year's final to Novak Djokovic by displacing the Serbian great at the top of the game, winning 26 of his past 27 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  A World Anti-Doping Agency appeal against his initial exoneration has been hanging over his head since September, when WADA announced it was seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner now heads to Malaga where he hopes to lead Italy to a successful defence of their Davis Cup title. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy won the DP World Tour Championship for the third time and claimed his sixth Race to Dubai title in the process on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old from Northern Ireland made a crucial birdie on the par-4 16th hole to break a deadlock with Denmark's Rasmus Hojgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then birdied the par-5 18th hole for a three-under-par 69 that took him to 15-under for the four days and was enough for a two-shot win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus, who was trying to follow in the footsteps of his twin brother Nicolai and take the trophy back to Denmark for a second year in a row, made a stunning 22-footer par save on the 17th hole, but could not put the pressure on McIlroy on the 18th as he settled for a par and a final round score of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who started with a bogey and then made four successive birdies, dropped a couple of shots around the turn to be tied with Hojgaard after 15 holes at 13-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finally edged ahead with a stunning second shot on the par-4 16th hole from 137 yards to less than a foot for his fifth birdie of the day and drained a six-footer on the final hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Including the Zurich Classic that the world number three claimed alongside Shane Lowry, it was McIlroy's fourth worldwide win of the season and secured him the Race to Dubai crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Adam Scott and Ireland's Lowry shot final-round 68s to tie for third place at 11-under par alongside France's Antoine Rozner. England's Tyrrell Hatton was solo 6th at 10-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 10 players who earned their PGA Tour cards include Hojgaard, Thriston Lawrence of South Africa, England's Paul Waring, Dane Niklas Norgaard, Swede Jesper Svensson, Antoine Rozner of France, Italy's Matteo Manassero, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, Japan's Rikuya Hoshino and Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spanish rider Jorge Martin claimed his first MotoGP world championship title after finishing third in the season-ending Barcelona GP on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defending two-time champion Francesco Bagnaia, who started the race 19 points behind Martin, took the chequered flag for the 11th time this season but it was not enough to wrest the title from the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It sounds amazing," said an emotional Martin after being addressed as a world champion for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know what to say, I am completely shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is for my people, for my family, for the people who are supporting me, this is for them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started crying at the end, it was a very emotional race. It's been a long journey, a lot of crashes, big injuries but finally we are here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope we can keep improving and enjoy the moment. This is the most important thing: live the present and enjoy the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin, who will be leaving his Ducati satellite team Pramac for Aprilia next season, had made himself the favourite for the title with a remarkably consistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had only won three grand prix all season, but his third place on Sunday was the 32nd time this season across the 40 sprints and grand prix that he made the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing third in Saturday's sprint he knew he had only to finish in the top nine to secure the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia, however, has finished the season in blistering form, his victory in Barcelona giving him his fourth win over the final five races of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting from pole, the Italian made a perfect start but was soon under pressure from Marc Marquez who slipped past Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin let them battle it out up front, guarding his track position as Aleix Espargaro and Alex Marquez toughed it out behind him.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Martin crossed the line, the celebrations began in the Pramac garage and amongst the many Spanish fans who had made the journey to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was due to take place in Valencia but had to be moved after the region suffered its worst floods in a generation which have killed more than 220 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race was switched to Barcelona and has been dubbed the Solidarity GP to show support for the people of Valencia, with all proceeds of the event going to the Valencia relief fund. (AFP)

 Fly-half Thomas Ramos kicked 15 points to help France beat New Zealand 30-29 in a thrilling Test clash in Paris on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romain Buros, Paul Boudehent and Louis Bielle-Biarrey were the hosts' try-scorers as they claimed a third-straight win over the All Blacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Lakai and Cam Roigard crossed for New Zealand before Damian McKenzie's contributions with the boot set-up a nervy last half an hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  France head coach Fabien Galthie recalled experienced centre Gael Fickou to the starting lineup in one of four changes from last Saturday's easy win over Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand boss Scott Robertson welcomed back fly-half Beauden Barrett and hooker Codie Taylor after the influential pair missed last week's win over Ireland with injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the game New Zealand captain Scott Barrett said his side lost the scrum battle with the French in their World Cup defeat 13 months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, the set-piece proved crucial in the opening score as the visitors were penalised and Les Bleus led 3-0 after seven minutes thanks to a Ramos shot at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robertson's outfit reacted almost immediately to make it 7-3 as Lakai, a second-minute replacement, crashed over for his maiden Test try and Beauden Barrett slotted the extras after nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks had the upper hand after the opening quarter, profiting from a poor France lineout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their dominance paid off even further after half an hour as scrum-half Roigard celebrated his 24th birthday by intercepting a pass destined for opposite number Antoine Dupont after a scrum to stroll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  With seven minutes of the first-half to play, France cut the score to 14-10 as full-back Buros crossed on his Test debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the interval, New Zealand led 17-10 as Beauden Barrett added a penalty to his earlier two conversions with the visitors in control.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, the tight one-pass play paid off for the hosts as they trundled up the field before flanker Boudehent found a way over from a rolling maul.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos kicked the conversion to bring the sides level at 17-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Galthie had picked an extra forward on the bench by dropping fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the matchday squad and after 47 minutes brought on four of them at once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, it bore fruit, as France led for the first time in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winger Bielle-Biarrey dotted down after a Ramos grubber kick and with the Toulouse playmaker's extras they were 24-17 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the try, the game was far from over and with 17 minutes to go McKenzie kicked two penalties either side of a Ramos effort to make it 27-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  McKenzie added a third penalty for 27-26 with 13 minutes to go and a tense final 10 minutes was set-up as Ramos and McKenzie once again traded shots at goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The All Blacks were camped in their own territory but their attack was held up and referee Nika Amashukeli blew the full-time whistle to send the majority of the 80,000-capacity crowd delirious. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anthony Davis scored 40 points and LeBron James made more history to spark the Los Angeles Lakers over San Antonio 120-115 on Friday, launching their bid to defend the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  James managed a triple-double in a fourth consecutive game for the first time in his 22 NBA seasons, the 39-year-old legend delivering 15 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists over a game-high 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the game and I'm happy I'm still able to come out here and make some plays to help our ball club win," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  James tied a Lakers triple-double record streak and became the oldest player in NBA history with four triple-doubles in a row, all in winning efforts, although his seven turnovers stung.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just putting the work in. My teammates trust me with the ball," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I guess they trusted me a little too much tonight with the seven turnovers. I've got to be a lot better than that if I'm going to have the ball in my hands. I'll clean that up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis, who also grabbed 12 rebounds, won a battle of the big men with last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, Frenchman Victor Wembanyama, who had 28 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Spurs in the West Group B clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Another magnificent game by AD," James said. "We lean on AD every night. The ball goes to him not only the first option but also the second option... He has definitely been a beast this year."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Stephon Castle's basket gave the Spurs a 115-114 lead, Davis made a slam dunk with 91 seconds to play and James sank a layup, his first basket in more than 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Castle missed a tying 3-point attempt and James made two free throws to seal San Antonio's fate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Davis drove to the hoop and banged his right knee into the left knee of Wembanyama late in the game but both were playing at the finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers remained undefeated, downing Chicago 144-126 as games were played in all six NBA Cup groups with results also counting in the NBA regular-season standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland improved to 14-0 as Donovan Mitchell scored 37 points to lead the East Group C rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just so much fun. The vibes are right," Cleveland's Jarrett Allen said. "It just seems like everything is clicking right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers are only the sixth team in NBA history to start 14-0, matching the fourth-best start in league history.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group A, Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox scored 60 points but the host Kings lost to Minnesota 130-126 in overtime as Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves with 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, James Harden matched Ray Allen for second behind Stephen Curry on the NBA's all-time 3-pointers list on 2,973, scoring 21 points for the Los Angeles Clippers in a 125-104 loss at Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jabari Smith led the Rockets with 28 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 28 points to lead Oklahoma City over visiting Phoenix 99-83, keeping the Thunder in the Western Conference lead at 11-2 in the Group B game.
  <br>
  <br>
  In West Group C, Brandon Ingram had 29 points as host New Orleans snapped a six-game losing skid by beating Denver 101-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the league's rebounds and assists leader, was out for personal reasons as Denver's five-game win streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the same group, Golden State reserve Buddy Hield had 18 points and 12 Warriors scored in a 123-118 home victory over Memphis.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group C, Atlanta's Dyson Daniels led eight double-figure scorers with 25 points as the Hawks beat visiting Washington 129-117.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group A, Franz Wagner scored 31 points to lead Orlando over visiting Philadelphia 98-86.
  <br>
  <br>
  At New York, Jalen Brunson's 3-pointer with six seconds remaining gave the Knicks a 124-122 victory over Brooklyn. Brunson had 37 points while Cam Thomas hit 43 for the Nets.
  <br>
  <br>
  In East Group B, Bam Adebayo scored 30 points as Miami beat host Indiana 124-111 while Malik Beasley's 20 points led Detroit over host Toronto 99-95. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson's controversial return to boxing ended in a one-sided defeat on Friday, with Youtuber-turned-prizefighter Jake Paul cruising to victory by a unanimous decision against the heavyweight icon in Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, 58, barely landed a punch during the eight-round bout at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, with Paul winning by big margins on all three cards – 80-72, 79-73 and 79-73.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, 27, used his superior speed and movement to dominate the ageing Tyson with ease, and had the former undisputed heavyweight champion in trouble after landing a flurry of punches in the third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet the younger fighter was unable to land the knockout blow he had promised to deliver during Thursday's ill-tempered weigh-in, where Tyson slapped him across the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, however, looked every bit of his 58 years, managing to land only a handful of meaningful punches during the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Final statistics showed Tyson connected with just 18 of 97 punches thrown while Paul threw some 278 punches and landed 78 of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the final seconds of the eighth round counted down, Paul could even afford to bow in respect to Tyson before the bell sounded. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland rebounded from defeat to New Zealand by edging Argentina 22-19 in a nailbiting one-off rugby union Test at Lansdowne Road on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish led by 13 points at the break but a lack of discipline and excellent play by the Pumas almost gave the visitors their first ever win in Ireland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went right down to the wire there," Ireland skipper Caelen Doris told TNT Sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were happy with how it started. There was a good feeling through the warm-up and that carried over to the start. I felt we were in a pretty good position at half time and their quality showed in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ireland started brightly but it was the Pumas who thought they had struck first through Matias Moroni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead Moroni trudged off after receiving a yellow card for a head collision with Irish fly-half Jack Crowley earlier in the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Crowley who was celebrating a minute later as he went over for his second Test try and converting it for 7-0 in the fourth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barely a minute had passed since Crowley's try when Garry Ringrose broke through the centre and a sublime pass by Jamison Gibson-Park found Tadhg Beirne, who selflessly passed inside to Mack Hansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australia-born wing touched down for his 10th Test try -- Crowley failed to convert but the Irish were 12-0 up inside six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pumas fly-half Tomas Albornoz got his team on the board with a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish piled the pressure on the visitors and were denied a third try after Beirne knocked on as he went to touch the ball down.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they lost prop Finlay Bealham to a yellow card in the 17th minute for a dangerous tackle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Farrell looked rueful in the coach's box as Bealham trotted off with Albornoz knocking over the penalty for 12-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crowley landed a sweetly struck drop goal to make it 15-6 to the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz's unerring boot added three more points shortly before Bealham returned to the fray for 15-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas resisted waves of Irish attacks but finally cracked just after the half hour mark as Joe McCarthy powered over for his second Test try -- Crowley converted for 22-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Irish line somehow held out as the Pumas pressed in the final few minutes of the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ringrose turned the ball over and the hosts breathed easier as they headed in 22-9 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Pumas responded brilliantly after the break, fullback Juan Cruz Mallia broke through from deep, Ringrose and Hansen failing to bring him down, and touched down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz converted for 22-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish discipline was creaking just as it did against the All Blacks, conceding three penalties within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Paul Williams had had enough of Irish offsides and sent McCarthy to the sin bin much to Farrell's frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albornoz moved past 100 points in Test rugby with a smoothly taken penalty for 22-19 and just under half an hour to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The penalty count went to 10 as Crowley took out Albornoz in the air, but at the end of the next phase of play the Pumas' fly-half sent a drop goal attempt wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farrell rang the changes just after the hour including replacing Crowley with 21-year-old Sam Prendergast for his first cap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the biggest cheer of the night came in the 67th minute as prop Cian Healy came on to equal Brian O'Driscoll's Irish record of 133 caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Irish were hanging on but received a huge boost when Pumas replacement Francisco Gomez Kodela was sin-binned for a head shot on Doris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pumas were the ones pressing right at the end and were inside the 22 when the Irish managed to turn the ball over. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mike Tyson could not wait to put on the gloves to take a shot at upcoming opponent Jake Paul, striking the social media influencer-turned-boxer in the face as they approached each other at Thursday's weigh-in at Arlington, Texas.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-time "Baddest Man on the Planet," 58-year-old Tyson is returning to the ring for his first professional fight in 19 years against "ultimate heel" Paul in the wildly anticipated showdown at the AT&T Stadium on Friday (8 pm EST).
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no love lost between the two as Tyson, who weighed in at 228.4 pounds, approached Paul and immediately slapped the 27-year-old in the face and offered a two-word televised remark before walking off stage: "Talking's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul, who gained a cult following on YouTube before turning to boxing four years ago, was far more loquacious, offering an expletive-riddled rant about his plans to demolish Tyson, who has a 50-6 record with 44 knockouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's angry, he's an angry little elf," said Paul, who weighed in at 227.2 pounds. "It's personal now – he must die!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight is the first live boxing match that Netflix has aired, as the streamer with more than 280 million subscribers makes inroads into the sports arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match has drawn extraordinary global interest but also criticism, with British promoter Eddie Hearn dismissing the bout as "dangerous, irresponsible and disrespectful to boxing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyson, who had two stints in prison over convictions in the 1990s for rape and assault and declared bankruptcy 21 years ago, said in an interview last month that the fight was not about the payday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not for financial reasons. My life is not going to change, not one percentage point after this fight. We will always be able to live this way," he said. "And I'm just doing it because I want to test myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, Paul will get US$40 million for the fight, a number he mentioned at another news conference in New York in August. Tyson will get US$20 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mr Tyson's last professional fight was a loss against Kevin McBride in 2005. The fight against Paul will be shorter: eight two-minute rounds instead of the typical 10 or 12 three-minute rounds. Both boxers will also use heavier 14-ounce gloves instead of the typical 10-ounce gloves. (Reuters/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 34-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    England triumph over Greece despite star absences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

    Sinner beats Medvedev for perfect ATP Finals group run

<img alt="Sinner reacts after defeating Medvedev in his final group match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779233_1_20241115071240.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    Haughey takes break from swimming to ponder future

<img alt="Siobhan Haughey says she is getting old after taking part in the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in three cities. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778903_1_20241113180939.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey said she will be taking a three- to four-month break from the sport to consider her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" had mentioned before the Paris Olympics of possible retirement, which she said on Wednesday is still on her mind after the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai, Incheon and Singapore during which she won five gold, two silvers and two bronze medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to use this break to think about what my future direction will be. These three stops at the World Cup has made me realise that I am getting old, and that my body recovery is taking more time," the 27-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will be competing at the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest from December 10 to 15 before taking the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is looking forward to spending the Christmas holiday with her family because she spent previous years taking part in competitions around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she hopes to use the break to do things that she usually doesn't get to do because of training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey was speaking to reporters after a ceremony at the South China Athletic Association where the newly completed Water Sports Centre was named after her.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she feels honoured given that she spent a lot of time practising at the association as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she participated in the design for the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this isn't just meaningful to me, but I hope it's meaningful to the community because I'm trying to use what I'm doing to promote swimming and to promote sports," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that the next generation can be here to witness this, and hopefully they find some sort of inspiration through all of this and think this is meaningful too."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner hit the accelerator at the end of each set as he cruised past Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 on Tuesday to close in on a semi-final spot at the ATP Finals in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In September, Sinner had to overcome raucous home support to win his last meeting with the American as he claimed victory in the final of the US Open, also in straight sets. This time, the Turin crowd was nosily behind the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd is helping me a lot," said Sinner on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard-hitting Fritz, ranked number five, put pressure on Sinner's serve early in the first set. The American had the first break point of the match in the 14-minute seventh game, but could not take his chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner responded at once, but wasted three break points in the next game before breaking to 15 in the 10th game to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling to return his serve but I am happy with how I handled the situation," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set also went with serve until the 10th game when Fritz double-faulted on Sinner's first match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very tough match," said Sinner. "We got to know each other very well in a Grand Slam final, we knew exactly what to expect today it was very aggressive as I was prepared for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory put Sinner top of the Ilie Nastase group with just Daniil Medvedev to face. The home favourite could still be eliminated with a straight-sets loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz faces Alex de Minaur who has lost both his matches so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the afternoon match, former champion Medvedev brushed aside Finals debutant De Minaur 6-2, 6-4 to bounce back from an opening defeat and boost his hopes of making the knock-out phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, who lost his first group-stage match to Fritz, overpowered De Minaur to push his Australian opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who lifted the title in 2020, did not face a single break point and broke De Minaur's serve three times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth seed will next face Sinner on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I decided not to care about it in a good way," Medvedev said. "If I lose, the season is over, if I win I have another chance on Thursday – I'll try and do the same the next match, so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players battled to holds in their opening service games, but Medvedev broke for a 2-1 lead and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck 16 winners in the first set and then lost just two points behind his serve in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  A break in the ninth game of the second set proved decisive and he closed out victory with another comfortable hold. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula 1's race director Niels Wittich has left his role with immediate effect, the FIA said on Tuesday, in a surprise move.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German, who replaced Michael Masi in 2022, will be replaced for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 23 by Rui Marques, who was recently the race director for Formula 2 and 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FIA can confirm that Niels Wittich has stepped down from his position as F1 Race Director to pursue new opportunities," the FIA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is extremely rare for an F1 race director to be changed mid-season, but the FIA did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masi was removed as Formula One race director after his controversial management of the season-ending 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Max Verstappen pipped Lewis Hamilton to the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not clear if Wittich is the latest victim of a disagreement with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of staff in senior FIA roles have resigned this year. (AFP)

<img alt="Barcelona players celebrate scoring their second goal against St. Poelten. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778786_1_20241113082111.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-goal blitz in the space of 12 minutes sent Barcelona on their way to a 7-0 romp over St. Poelten in the Uefa Women's Champions League on Tuesday, while Manchester City stayed top of Group D with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal beat Juventus 4-0 in Italy but remain second in Group C after Bayern Munich extended their 100 percent record with a 3-0 victory over Valerenga.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Barcelona, Ewa Pajor, Francisca Nazareth, Aitana Bonmati, Keira Walsh and Claudia Pina all scored between the 32nd and 45th minutes, before Pina and Caroline Graham Hansen added goals in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite scoring 16 goals and conceding none in their last two European outings, holders Barca sit second in Group D after they lost their opening fixture at Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Objective met – yes, absolutely," Barca coach Pere Romeu said after his side's second emphatic victory in three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when we couldn't score in the first half an hour, we were getting in behind them. And I knew once we got the first goal, more would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's St Poelten stay bottom of the group with three losses from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The floodgates opened at the Johan Cruyff Stadium shortly after the half-hour when Pajor slid onto full-back Ona Batlle's cross at the near post and directed the ball into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stand-in captain Marta Torrejon nearly doubled the score soon after she rose highest from a set-piece, but her looping header clipped the top of the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from picking up her second Ballon d'Or last month, Aitana Bonmati nearly caught Carina Schlueter out with a chip but the goalkeeper just managed to claw out the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were all over the Austrians. When Bonmati got in behind the defence on the right, her cross was parried to Nazareth who made no mistake on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmati opened her account in the Champions League this season two minutes later, before Walsh fizzed home a side-footed strike from outside the box in the 42nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the stroke of half-time, Pina flitted in at the back post to guide home an outside-of-the-foot volley as Barca ran riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish forward then completed her brace from 12 yards seven minutes after the interval following a foul on the rampaging Batlle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Graham added a seventh in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man City stayed three points ahead of Barca after second-half goals by Laura Brown and Aoba Fujino overcame Sweden's Hammarby 2-0. (AFP)

    FA launches investigation into referee Coote

<img alt="Referee David Coote during the Premier League football match between Liverpool and Brighton. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778784_1_20241113081326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Football Association is investigating after a video was posted on social media appearing to show Premier League referee David Coote making derogatory comments about Liverpool and their former manager Jurgen Klopp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Referees body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd announced on Monday that Coote, 42, had been suspended pending a full investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Football Association is also looking at Coote's comments. It is understood part of its investigation will centre on whether Coote's reference to Klopp's nationality constitutes an aggravated breach of its misconduct rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware of the matter, and we are investigating it," an FA spokesman said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the clip, Coote, who refereed Liverpool's 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday, said Klopp was "arrogant" and used offensive language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retired referee Mike Dean, now a TV pundit, believes the incident will have a damaging effect on officials throughout English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As referees you can't put yourself in that position no matter what you do," the 56-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can say things away from camera, you can talk amongst your friends and things and colleagues," he added. "But you can't let somebody video this and then hope that it's never going to come out."
  <br>
  <br>
  The video appears to refer to a match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1. Liverpool had already been crowned champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp criticised Coote after the match, saying the referee had been too lenient in his treatment of Burnley challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp left Liverpool at the end of last season after nearly nine years in charge at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was also critical of Coote over an incident in a match against Arsenal last season in which Gunners midfielder Martin Odegaard's hand made contact with the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote, as VAR, did not advise on-field official Chris Kavanagh to review the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote was also the VAR in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in October 2020 when Toffees goalkeeper Jordan Pickford inflicted a season-ending injury on Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pickford was not sent off for the challenge and did not face retrospective action because, under FA rules, that can only happen if an incident was not seen either at the time or when it was reviewed by VAR. (AFP)

    Fresh bid to enhance sports medicine

<img alt="The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance sports medicine in Hong Kong. Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Sports Institute" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778718_2_20241112183046.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind once more to preserve their 100 percent start to the season with a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, who overcame a 14-point deficit to beat Brooklyn on Saturday, were again forced to dig deep, battling back from nine points down in the third quarter for a road victory that takes them to 12-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led another fine all-round offensive performance from Cleveland, who have emerged as the surprise package of the season and are the only undefeated team in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six Cleveland players finished in double figures, with point guard Darius Garland adding 17 points and Evan Mobley 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and Ty Jerome all had 12 points each off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago meanwhile were left ruing their inability to take full advantage after pulling into an 85-76 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Cleveland came roaring back with a 9-0 run to tie the game and then pulled ahead to lead by three points heading into the fourth quarter, before closing out victory by outscoring Chicago 24-21 in the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zach LaVine led Chicago's scorers with 26 points, while Coby White and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points apiece. The Bulls fell to 4-7 with the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We dug deep," Mitchell said after the win. "Honestly, the bench saved us. Starters were a little fatigued, and I guess teams are coming at us. But we persevered, and shoutout to the bench for that – it's a group effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us to continue to be what we want to be, that's what it's going to take," he added. "It was a complete team win – every night it's somebody different. We're playing for each other, being selfless. We've got to keep it going." (AFP)

    Ohtani nominated for MVP after historic 2024 campaign

<img alt="Ohtani during game four of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees." src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778646_1_20241112102042.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was named among the nominees for Major League Baseball's National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday after a historic debut season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is bidding for back-to-back MVP honours after winning the award last season while playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the American League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, who has already won two MVP awards in his career, is coming off a season which saw him become the first player in history to amass 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old slugger also helped the Dodgers claim a second World Series in five seasons in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani faces competition from shortstop Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the American League meanwhile, New York Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Juan Soto were nominated alongside Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MVP awards, which are voted on by a ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWA), will be announced on November 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the nominees announced for the National League manager of the year award, with the Dodgers' World Series-winning manager Dave Roberts failing to make the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roberts was tipped to be among the favourites after guiding the Dodgers to an MLB-best 98 regular season wins, despite having a pitching staff decimated by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Roberts missed out, with Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets, the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Murphy and the San Diego Padres' Mike Shildt named as the nominees. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner spent his first rest day at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday collecting the trophy for finishing the year ranked the number one tennis player in the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner entered the season-ending event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult," Sinner added, calling himself "very lucky".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    Messi, Inter Miami eliminated from MLS Cup playoffs

<img alt="Messi on the pitch in the first half against the Atlanta United FC. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778472_1_20241111084556.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi's goal of winning the MLS Cup title came to an abrupt end on Saturday with his Inter Miami suffering a shock first-round elimination from the playoffs after a 3-2 home defeat to Atlanta United FC.
 <br>
  <br>
  Miami had won the regular season campaign with a record points total but after losing twice in the best-of-three series, the MLS Cup favourites and their eight-times Ballon d'Or winner are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the accolades Miami received for their regular season 'Supporters' Shield' triumph count for little after an Atlanta team which finished ninth in the Eastern Conference pulled off a stunning upset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter took the lead in the 17th minute when Messi was denied by a diving save from Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan but Matías Rojas followed in to slot home the loose ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Messi who finally broke through in the 65th minute, meeting a Marcelo Weigandt cross from the right with a thundering header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami pushed forward in search of the winner but instead they were caught out once again with Pedro Amador's cross from the left headed home at the back post by Polish midfielder Bartosz Slisz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter players were furious that the referee had allowed play to continue while their defender Tomás Avilés lay injured on the floor but their frustration was in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final whistle brought a deflated silence over Chase Stadium as Miami's season, which so many had expected would end with their first MLS Cup title, concluded with the sight of Guzan and his Atlanta team-mates celebrating.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Miami head coach Gerardo Martino, who won MLS Cup with Atlanta in 2018, an inquest is sure to follow but he tried to put a brave face on the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season has had good and bad things. If you think about where we were in November last year, there has obviously been progress in terms of the club, not just the team," he said. "If you think about the expectations we had for this playoffs, obviously we came up a little short," said the Argentine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martino said there was a despondent mood in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are sad, as they should be when there are so many expectations and the team can't fulfil them," he added. "In this final part of the year we got used to achieving the objectives but we couldn't achieve the most important one." (AFP)

    Chiefs escape Broncos to remain unbeaten on season

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten start to the NFL season after blocking a last-gasp field goal to snatch a dramatic 16-14 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reigning Super Bowl champions looked poised to suffer their first defeat of the campaign after rookie Broncos quarterback Bo Nix expertly engineered a late fourth-quarter drive to the Kansas City 17-yard line.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left Wil Lutz with what should have been a straightforward 35-yard chip shot to win the game with the final kick of an absorbing clash at Arrowhead Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lutz and the Broncos were left stunned after Chiefs' defensive end Mike Danna got a hand to the kick to block the attempt and leave Kansas City exhaling a collective sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes raced across the field in celebration with his teammates as Kansas City sealed a win that sees them improve to 9-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just speaks to this entire team," Mahomes said of Kansas City's great escape. "I felt offensively we didn't do enough. Defensively we stepped it up in the second half, and then special teams – we're a full team. It's everybody, it was a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody believes, no one has any doubts, we just keep pushing and we found a way in the end," the 29-year-old Mahomes added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was hard on Broncos signal-caller Nix, who had shown superb composure throughout to help Denver take a 14-3 second quarter lead thanks to touchdown passes wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Courtland Sutton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's defense, meanwhile, gave Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a torrid time, sacking the Kansas City quarterback four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes, though, gradually got his team back into the game, connecting with Travis Kelce for a touchdown that made it 14-10 at the half, before two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half gave them a slender 16-14 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nix then appeared to have done enough to give Denver a chance at winning the game, only for the blocked field goal drama to deny the Broncos a famous win. (AFP)

    Man Utd win to end Van Nistelrooy's interim tenure

<img alt="Van Nistelrooy celebrates on pitch after the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778469_1_20241111083242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy said his four games as interim manager of Manchester United was a "short but amazing period" after ending his run unbeaten with a 3-0 victory over Leicester on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, who remains a legend at Old Trafford for his goal return during a glorious playing career, also oversaw victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League either side of a 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim will be in charge when the Red Devils next take the field away to Ipswich in two weeks' time, with Van Nistelrooy's own future still unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did a good job," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period," he added. "We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs, and help the club which is important."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment," he went on to say. "To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes continued his scoring streak under Van Nistelrooy with a powerful effort for his fourth goal in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his 250th appearance for the club, Fernandes also had a hand in the second goal as his header was deflected into his own net by Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho then came off the bench to rifle in a brilliant third goal as United shrugged off their problems in front of goal so far this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils remain down in 13th in the Premier League table but are only four points adrift of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy returned to the club where he scored 150 goals in June as an assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision is yet to be made over whether he will have a role in Amorim's coaching team but the 48-year-old is proud of the work he has done in recent weeks to stabilise the club in troubled times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We tried to stabilise after a difficult and emotional period. We wanted to get players performing at their best, we got the right feeling to them and got them believing in themselves," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This spell was a big responsibility, and I took it very seriously," Van Nistelrooy went on to say. "I wanted to help and get United into a better place – that was my goal. With three wins and a draw it's a standard where you want to grow to as a club." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal and Chelsea are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their 1-1 draw on Sunday, while Ipswich stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League victory in 22 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are now winless in four Premier League games, as their bid for a first title since 2004 is at risk of unravelling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners welcomed captain Martin Odegaard back to the starting line-up for the first time in two months and were much improved at Stamford Bridge, but still could not come away with a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very unlucky. We have dominated one of the best teams in Europe but we don't get the results – that is what is missing," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after the derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard teed up Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring with a near-post shot on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea responded through Pedro Neto's brilliant long-range effort for his first league goal since a US$66 million move from Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has two new worries to add to what he describes as a nightmare run of injuries, after Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice both failed to finish the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice went off after 71 minutes, and Saka was replaced 10 minutes later with both sustaining knocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good because for two players of that importance to say they want to come off is unusual," Arteta told reporters. "I don't expect them to be fit for the international break."
  <br>
  <br>
  A share of the spoils sees the Blues remain ahead of Arsenal on goal difference as both sides move into the top four.

  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ipswich will play host to Ruben Amorim's first match as Manchester United manager in two weeks, and go into that game buoyed by their first win since ending a two-decade wait to return to the top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive moment – one to cherish," said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sammie Szmodics took advantage of statuesque Tottenham defending to open the scoring with an overhead kick on 31 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liam Delap doubled the visitors' lead in far less spectacular fashion as he lashed in from point-blank range after Radu Dragusin directed a cross towards his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs had come back to win in eight of the previous 12 league matches they conceded first at home this year but this time left themselves with too much to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Bentancur reduced the arrears with a powerful header from Pedro Porro's corner but they fell to a fifth league defeat in 11 games.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner got his bid for a first ATP Finals title underway with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur on Sunday as former champion Daniil Medvedev lost his head during his defeat to Taylor Fritz.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner delighted supporters in Turin with a comfortable win over Finals debutant De Minaur to move first in the Ilie Nastase Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one, who hadn't played since winning the Shanghai Masters last month, only had one brief scare when his serve was broken early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he quickly recovered to rattle off four straight games and take the opening set to 5-2 before closing it out with his first set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner closed out a routine victory in emphatic fashion with a perfect service game and basked in the applause of his home fans after smashing an ace to finish in style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner, who lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, tops the world rankings after a stunning season in which he claimed the Australian and US Opens – his first Grand Slam victories – and won five more ATP titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, world number four Daniil Medvedev boiled with anger during his 6-4, 6-3 loss to American Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev destroyed his racket after going a set down and things went from bad to worse when Fritz broke serve to take a 4-2 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev was docked a penalty point for throwing his racket at a courtside microphone and during game seven of the second set he held a new racket by its head while waiting for Fritz's serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the match Medvedev, whose behaviour was jeered by the crowd, replied "100 percent" when asked if he was hoping for the end of the season to come along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired to fight against something that doesn't depend on myself," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll see how it goes," he added. "Today actually I had my chances. I'll have them the next matches – if it doesn't work out, I go on holiday. I'm happy." (AFP)

    Krejcikova calls for respect after gaffe by journalist

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level." (Reuters)

<img alt="Mark Cavendish says he intends to stay involved with cycling. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778424_1_20241110190800.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Cavendish sprinted to one last victory on Sunday as he took the Singapore Criterium in a signature surge to the line.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I really wanted that so bad," the 39-year-old Briton said after his 166th career victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm terribly emotional. I realised in the last five laps that this was the last 15 kilometres of my career. I passed the flamme rouge for the last time in my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming out of the last bend, Cavendish, who holds the record for most stage wins in the Tour de France, briefly latched onto the wheel of defending champion Jasper Philipsen before pulling away. The Manxman had time to glance back before raising his arms in triumph one last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975, having matched the Belgian's mark in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was so on the limit. I didn't race since the Tour de France so I am missing sharpness," said Cavendish who returned to the saddle to finish third in the Saitama Criterium on November 2, clinched by Biniam Girmay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Criterium, organised by the Tour de France, covered 25 laps of a street circuit. Cavendish stayed in the peloton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was nervous about crashing, or something like that; not that there is anything wrong with that but I really wanted to finish," said Cavendish.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he intended to stay involved with cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love this sport. I've always loved it," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Tour de France isn't just a bike race it's the biggest annual sports event in the world, it's what children dream of. It's what adults dream of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling is such a form of freedom. It's a way to be however you want to be. It has so much potential as a sport, as a mode of transport, as a pastime. I will do anything I can to help this move forward." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Olympic tennis champion Zheng Qinwen narrowly missed the title in her WTA Finals debut, losing to Coco Gauff of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After the two players split the first two sets, Gauff came from 2-0 and 5-3 down in the final set and was two points from defeat at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet she took the set to a tiebreaker and won the first six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng threatened a comeback but Gauff took the victory off her third match point with a forehand winner as she came into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I was like a couple of points away from losing, but I just tried to stay in the moment honestly, and I'm really proud of myself," said Gauff, who's the first American to win the Finals since Serena Williams in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng was looking to complete a season in which she reached a grand slam final for the first time at the Australian Open and delivered China’s first Olympic tennis singles gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The match today, it’s just a couple of important points,” Zheng said. “The match was very close."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added, "And then I had a great season. It's my first time in the WTA Finals. Even though the final did not go in my way, I still got a lot of things to learn." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia coach Joe Schmidt hailed Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii as an "aerial freak" after the cross-code capture marked his first senior game of rugby union by starring in the Wallabies' thrilling 42-37 win over England at Twickenham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Suaalii, a multi million-dollar convert from rugby league, was named player of the match after posing problems for England under the high ball, with the outside centre's sublime pass also sending in full-back Tom Wright for the first of the Wallabies' five tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead changed hands four times late on before, with England 37-35 ahead, Australia replacement back Max Jorgensen went over for the last of the game's 10 tries in the 84th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmidt, reflecting on Suaalii's performance, said: "I thought he was strong. I thought he was really well supported by Lenny Ikitau. Lenny was outstanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joseph obviously got a few kick-offs back for us. He's a bit of an aerial freak, but at the same time, it was a good learning experience for Joseph as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns had been expressed about whether pitching Suaalii into the cauldron of a Twickenham crowd of over 81,000 was a wise move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Schmidt, a former Ireland coach, said: "I know there were some doubts expressed about him being selected and the risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people would now see the opportunity of involving a young man like that, " the New Zealander added.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was only Australia's second victory in 12 games against England and first over their old rivals at Twickenham since they knocked the Red Rose brigade out of the 2015 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also followed a woeful return in this year's southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, where Australia lost five of their six games, and marked an ideal start to their Grand Slam tour, with struggling Wales next up for the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three tries in the last five minutes to win it, lose it and win it, it was so up and down, but one thing that stayed up was the effort from our team," said Schmidt.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Jamie George, meanwhile, said the hosts had produced an "unacceptable" display after they missed 35 tackles against the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was England's fifth straight defeat by a leading rugby nation and followed last week's agonising 24-22 loss to New Zealand in their November opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  England coach Steve Borthwick lamented lost opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a game we should have won. We were in a position to win multiple times," Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you turn over that much ball and make the game that unstructured against a team with that much pace, you're giving them opportunities. We gave them far too many opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, New Zealand ended Ireland's 19-match winning streak at Lansdowne Road, running out 23-13 victors over the world ranked number one side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Argentina launched their November international campaign with a ninth successive victory over Italy, winning 50-18 in Udine, and Antoine Dupont guided France to a 52-12 win over visiting Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, the Springboks play Scotland at Murrayfield, and Wales host Fiji in Cardiff. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat after blowing the lead to lose 2-1 at Brighton, allowing Liverpool to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City had not suffered defeat in the league for nearly a year prior to losing at Bournemouth last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after also exiting the League Cup to Tottenham and being on the end of a 4-1 thrashing by Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola has lost four straight matches for the first time in his illustrious managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions looked set to bounce back from their chastening night in Lisbon on Tuesday when Erling Haaland prodded in his 15th goal of the season at the second attempt after his initial effort was saved by Bart Verbruggen.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, though, were opened up at will in the second half and were finally punished by a pair of Brighton substitutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro fired in the equaliser after City failed to clear in a goalmouth scramble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt O'Riley has had to wait for his Premier League debut after suffering a serious ankle injury days after sealing a move from Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Danish international marked his bow in style when he slotted in from Pedro's pass seven minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not able to do 90 minutes right now. Four defeats in a row. We have to change things quick," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe after seven years winning six Premier Leagues, maybe one year another team deserves it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool kicked off at Anfield just 30 minutes later and quickly capitalised on City's latest slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a superb counter-attack in the 20th minute, Mohamed Salah was sent racing clear by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Salah tumbled to the turf under pressure, Darwin Nunez seized on the loose ball and fired high into the net from an acute angle for his third goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's composed finish in the 84th minute after another rapid Liverpool raid sealed their ninth win in 11 league games and 15th victory in 17 matches in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first English title since 2020, Liverpool, who finished a distant third to City last season, have been revitalised following Arne Slot's arrival from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp as manager in the close-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa have slumped to eighth place after losing their last four games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves ended a wait since April for a Premier League win by beating fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to move off the foot of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary O'Neil was under huge pressure to deliver after a 13-game winless run in the top flight and got the perfect start when Pablo Sarabia swept home Matheus Cunha's pass for Wolves' fastest ever Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cunha smashed home a stunning second goal himself early in the second period to give Wolves a vital three points, which sees Southampton replace them at the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's huge for us. He has such ability," said O'Neil on Cunha's influence. "A big win for us and Matheus Cunha had a big say in it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham moved into seventh by inflicting more misery on Crystal Palace with a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe put Fulham ahead and Palace's Daichi Kamada saw red for a wild lunge on Kenny Tete before Harry Wilson wrapped up the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa scored a brace as Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice the in-form Cherries led through Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bees have taken 16 points from a possible 18 at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford quickly levelled on both occasions through Wissa and Mikkel Damsgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wissa then completed the comeback with his seventh goal in eight league appearances this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham and Everton did little to quell the discontent among both fanbases in a 0-0 draw. (AFP)

 Cycling great Mark Cavendish announced his retirement from the sport on Saturday, writing on social media that his final race will be Sunday's Tour de France Singapore Criterium.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Sunday will be the final race of my professional cycling career," wrote the 39-year-old British rider, the record stage winner on the Tour de France with 35, in a post on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling has given me so much and I love the sport. I've always wanted to make a difference in it and now I am ready to see what the next chapter has in store for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am lucky enough to have done what I love for almost 20 years and I can now say that I have achieved everything that I can on the bike," the rider from the Isle of Man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish won the world road race title in 2011 and an omnium silver medal at the 2016 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over two decades he won 165 races, including 17 stages in the Giro d'Italia and three in the Vuelta a Espana. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hotly tipped Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki was on Saturday given the green light to follow in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and move to Major League Baseball.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki, widely regarded as one of the best players in Japan's domestic league, will be posted for a potential move to the US, his club the Chiba Lotte Marines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means MLB clubs will have the right to bid for the 23-year-old right-hander this offseason, in an agreement between the Japanese and American leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki threw a perfect game in April 2022 and was part of the Japan team that won last year's World Baseball Classic alongside Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani won his first MLB championship last month when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki said he had "nothing but gratitude" to the Marines for agreeing to post him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You only get one baseball career and I don't want to have any regrets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meet the expectations of everyone who has pushed me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki's father and grandparents were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  His house was swept away when the earthquake unleashed a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing, and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. (AFP)

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers maintain their perfect start to the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778284_1_20241109122355.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their perfect start to the NBA season in sensational style on Friday, seizing a 41-point halftime lead on the way to a 136-117 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 10-0, ending the Warriors' five-game winning streak and handing them their first road defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The damage was done early, the Cavs' 83 first-half points tying a franchise record for most scored in any half and their 41-point halftime lead the biggest in team history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the Warriors' second-ranked defense, the Cavs posted their fifth game of the young season with at least 130 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ties a team record for the most 130-plus point games for an entire season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten-0 is a magic number," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. "We're playing really good basketball and I'm just really pleased where the group is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was worried about tonight - they're 7-1 and rolling and they're coming in here, they're champions and they're going to try and knock our block off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 27 points, Evan Mobley added 23 and Ty Jerome chipped in 20 off the bench as six Cavs players scored in double figures against a Warriors defense that came in ranked second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, they kept the potentially explosive Warriors offense in check, opening the game on a 20-2 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way we came out tonight, that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins with nine points and Stephen Curry with seven were the only Warriors starters to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State were able to adjust after the break, out-scoring the Cavs 41-29 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors, however, were in too deep a hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 21 points off the bench, Curry finished with 12 on five-of-10 shooting, making just one from three-point range. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ineos Britannia has been accepted as the Challenger of Record for the next edition of the America's Cup sailing competition, organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory against their British opponents on October 19 and the challenge was lodged immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) and Emirates Team New Zealand are pleased to confirm that the RNZYS has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 38th America's Cup (AC38) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Limited, represented by Ineos Britannia, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC38," said a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton said: "The 38th America's Cup effectively started the moment the team crossed the finish line in Barcelona on 19th October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very exciting to have continuity with the Challenger of Record, Ineos Britannia, to continue to build the scale of the America's Cup globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AC38 would be a "multi-challenger event." At this year's America's Cup, Ineos Britannia won a qualifying event that enabled them to take on the defending champions for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Yacht Squadron said it would "work alongside The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron" to deliver the protocol for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The class of yacht will be the AC75 and teams will be restricted to building one boat.
  <br>
  <br>
  No date has yet been set but the statement from the organisers said it is "intended that the AC38 match be held within three years of the completion of the AC37 match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team New Zealand won the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time to end the best-of-13 series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British boat was skippered by four-time Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie and is bankrolled by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemical group Ineos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

    F1 takes on FIA chief in open letter amid swearing row

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One drivers on Thursday blasted the "tone and language" used by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem amid a row over swearing at press conferences.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an open letter, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) also demanded that competitors be treated like adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several drivers, including three-time world champion Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Monaco's Charles Leclerc, were recently sanctioned by the FIA for swearing at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Ben Sulayem has spoken out in favour of measures to ensure drivers no longer use foul language.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the GPDA hit back with a letter posted on social media regarding 'Driver Misconduct'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as an F1 car, or a driving situation," the letter read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the FIA president to consider his own tone and language when talking to our member drivers, or indeed about them, whether in a public forum or otherwise," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, our members are adults," it went on to say. "They do not need to be given instructions via the media, about matters as trivial as the wearing of jewellery or underpants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has clashed with FIA bosses for wearing jewellery at races, with the governing body also reminding drivers of the need to wear flame-resistant underwear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GPDA also stressed its opposition to financial sanctions against drivers and called on Ben Sulayem to clarify how they are imposed and how their proceeds are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Ben Sulayem, team bosses and drivers have deteriorated in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FIA president was accused at the start of the year of trying to derail the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix and influence the results of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In both cases, the Emirati was cleared by the FIA Ethics Committee. (AFP)

    World number two Swiatek crashes out of WTA Finals

<img alt="The world number two needed a victory from Gauff to advance to the last four. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778086_1_20241108080912.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the WTA Finals on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova defeated Coco Gauff to secure her spot in the semi-finals at the expense of the Pole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Wimbledon champion claimed a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Gauff to end the title defence of Swiatek, who needed Krejcikova to lose in order to progress from the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one win and one loss under her belt entering the last day of round-robin play, Swiatek's 6-1, 6-0 victory over alternate Daria Kasatkina did not have any bearing on her qualification chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only scenario that would have led to Swiatek's advancement to the semi-finals would have been a Gauff win over Krejcikova.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result did not materialise though, and Krejcikova punched her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals for the first time – on her second singles appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova moves forward as the winner of the Orange Group, and will face Zheng Qinwen in Friday's last-four stage, with Gauff of the United States advancing as the runner-up to set up a semi-final showdown with world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Definitely this is a big win for me. I'm really happy with how I played and with my performance today. It was a really big match," said Krejcikova, who saved a remarkable 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Playing tomorrow again is something unimaginable before this tournament and I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just fighting for every ball, and I knew it's going to be difficult because I know Coco is on a roll and she's one of the best players this season," she added. "That was a huge challenge but also the big prize, the semis was on the table – I am super excited to be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff saved two match points in a 10-minute final game and had three opportunities to break Krejcikova but the eighth seed would not fold, and she scooped the victory with a service winner after one hour and 42 minutes of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova, who has won just 21 matches this season, earned her place in the WTA Finals field due to a new rule introduced by the Tour in 2024, which gives priority to a reigning Grand Slam champion over the eighth-ranked player in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova grabbed the last spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro, who chose not to come to Saudi Arabia as an alternate. (AFP)

 Kylian Mbappé has been left out of the France squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches against Israel and Italy, with coach Didier Deschamps insisting the absence of the Real Madrid superstar "is for the best".

  It is the second successive France squad from which the national team captain has been absent after he also missed the October double-header against Israel and Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have spoken with him and I have made the decision for this get-together because I think it is for the best," Deschamps told reporters at a press conference in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé was rested for last month's matches in order to help him recover from a minor thigh injury suffered playing for Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that quickly became a source of controversy when he returned to action for Real days later, before France had even played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé was absent for France's 4-1 win over Israel in a game played in Budapest and a 2-1 win in Belgium, and instead travelled to Stockholm for a short break with members of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was following that trip that Swedish media reported he was being investigated for an alleged rape. Mbappé himself said those reports were "fake news", while his lawyer said the player would take action for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Swedish prosecutor confirmed that an investigation had been opened, without naming Mbappe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not going to set out my argument, but I can say two things. The first is that Kylian wanted to come," Deschamps added. "The second is that it is not to do with the off-field problems because the presumption of innocence exists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last month's controversy, the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward has made four appearances for his club, scoring one goal. However, he remains short of his explosive best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to say any more about it. I stand by my decision," Deschamps added.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are second in Group A2 of the Nations League, one point behind leaders Italy, ahead of their final two fixtures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They host Israel at the Stade de France next Thursday, November 14, and then play Italy in Milan three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are five points clear of Belgium in third place and the top two teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, which will take place over two legs next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will be played next June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran midfielder N'Golo Kante, of Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, returns to the squad along with Adrien Rabiot of Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there is a first call-up for highly-rated Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who takes the place of West Ham United's Alphonse Areola in the squad. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

<img alt="Australia's Rachael Gunn competing against France's Sya Dembele in the Paris Olympics. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777941_1_20241107112433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn has announced her retirement from competition, citing "really upsetting" backlash following her performance at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Raygun's unorthodox routine – including kangaroo hops and imitating a sprinkler – failed to impress the judges at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her moves were copied on late-night talk shows and her unfashionable green tracksuit was mercilessly parodied online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspiracy theories abounded to explain how the university lecturer had even made it on to the Australia Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn said the intense scrutiny had been "really upsetting", and she had decided to pull the plug on her breakdancing career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to compete any more," she told Australian radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. "I was going to keep competing for sure, but that seems like a really difficult thing for me to do now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level of scrutiny that's going to be there," she added. "People will be filming it, it will be going online, it's just not going to be the same experience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn had previously spoken out against the "pretty devastating" hatred unleashed towards her after the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went out there and I had fun – I did take it very seriously. I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics, and I gave my all," she said in a video message after the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many lampooned her performance on social media, Gunn won support from others, including her fellow Australian Olympians and even the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun said she would continue to dance, just not in competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel bad about the way that they dance," she added. "If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor – then just own it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun did have the last laugh in September when she was briefly elevated to the top of the World Dance Sport Federation rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WDSF named her the number one women's breakdancer based on winning the Oceania Championship, one of only a few events held that counted towards the rankings in the run-up to the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympics debut in Paris, but will not feature at the next Games at Los Angeles in 2028. (AFP)

    Inter Milan sink Arsenal in Champions League

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hakan Calhanoglu penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italian champions remain undefeated in the competition this season and sit fifth on ten points at the midway point of the new league phase format.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think we played a great game against a strong side who play with great intensity," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced defeat for the first time in Europe this season and lie three points and seven places behind their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match at the San Siro looked set to go into the break goalless until a penalty was signalled against Mikel Merino after Mehdi Taremi's flick deviated the ball into the Arsenal player's raised hand from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very harshly done by," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "There is no deflection, nothing you can do in the box – so can he get away from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Calhanoglu stroked home the resulting spot-kick three minutes into first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yann Sommer and Denzel Dumfries combined on the line to deny Gabriel Magalhaes a leveller shortly before the hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal cranked up the pressure in the second half but were unable to break down Inter's solid defensive block as the Premier League side fell to a second defeat in four days. (AFP)

    Zheng into last four of WTA Finals, Sabalenka loses

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen continued to deliver in her breakthrough season as she advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Wednesday with victory over Jasmine Paolini, while Elena Rybakina beat the already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka.
 <br>
  <br>
  Picking up a 30th win from her last 35 matches, Chinese Olympic gold medallist Zheng swept past the fourth-seeded Italian 6-1, 6-1 in a mere 67 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Rybakina claimed a consolation 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number one Sabalenka, who had already secured her semi-final spot as the group winner on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eliminated from the competition after losing her opening two matches, Rybakina found her form against Sabalenka – a much-needed confidence boost for the world number five after missing the majority of the second half of the season with allergies, insomnia and a back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a tough match and I'm really happy that I managed to win. I think it's nice to finish the year at least with one win against the world number one," said Rybakina, who shared a warm embrace with Sabalenka at the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the second loss Sabalenka has suffered in her last 24 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, 26, must wait to find out who she will face in Friday's semi-finals, but has reason to celebrate despite defeat as she clinched the year-end number one ranking as a result of Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Belarusian said she will not let her new ranking distract her from the task at hand – lifting the WTA Finals trophy for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a really great feeling but I figured that last night and it didn't work really well tonight for me so I just want to focus on the current tournament to stay hungry and stay motivated – it's a big tournament and it's also one of my goals, so I'll focus on this goal," Sabalenka said Wednesday.

    Atlético stun PSG in Champions League clash

<img alt="Correa celebrates after scoring the late winner for Atlético. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777905_1_20241107074910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Ángel Correa scored a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Atlético Madrid snatched a 2-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kickstarting their Uefa Champions League campaign and casting a large cloud over the French club's European hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  It looked as if the game at the Parc des Princes would end in a draw after Warren Zaire-Emery's early opener for PSG was quickly cancelled out by Nahuel Molina, in what was the first ever meeting of the clubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG have been let down by their finishing in the Champions League all season and that was the case again here as they failed to convert a host of chances, but Atletico did not look like winning it until Correa struck in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniards would have been the happier of the two teams with a draw, especially as goalkeeper Jan Oblak had been forced into several second-half saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost back-to-back matches against Benfica and Lille, the win puts Atlético back on track to at least make the play-off round of this new-look Champions League, with the league phase now at the halfway stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The evening was also notable for the pre-match unfurling by PSG fans at one end of the stadium of an enormous banner in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "War on the pitch but peace in the world," said the banner, which also featured a Lebanese flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  That may lead to disciplinary action from Uefa, but that will probably be the least of PSG's worries right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  They may be comfortably on top of Ligue 1 but in the Champions League last season's semi-finalists have just four points, despite playing three of their four games so far at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having edged Girona 1-0 on the opening matchday and then lost 2-0 away to Arsenal, the French champions have since drawn at home to PSV Eindhoven and now lost to Atlético.
  <br>
  <br>
  They face a tough assignment next away to Bayern Munich and also still have to play Manchester City, meaning their hopes of finishing in the top 24 places and qualifying at least for the play-off round must be in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique's side will need to quickly improve in front of goal having now scored just three times in their last six Champions League matches, a run stretching back to last season's semi-final loss against Borussia Dortmund. (AFP)

    Gauff beats Swiatek, Sabalenka earns world number one

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in," said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things "a bit more tricky and different than usual".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match," the Pole added. (AFP)
