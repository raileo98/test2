<div class="itemFullText">
 Romelu Lukaku fired Napoli six points clear at the top of Serie A with the decisive goal in Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win at title rivals Atalanta, as Juventus beat AC Milan 2-0 to move into the Champions League spots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Belgium striker Lukaku nodded home his eighth Napoli goal from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's perfect cross in the 78th minute to give Antonio Conte's team a statement win in Bergamo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matteo Politano and Scott McTominay also scored for Napoli who have 50 points from 21 matches and have made it clear that they are now the team to beat in this year's title race after scoring three times from their only shots on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say whether it's my most important goal (for Napoli) but the win is important. We showed tonight that we're a top team," said Lukaku to Sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Napoli are gunning for a second Scudetto in three seasons and await the response from champions and closest challengers Inter Milan, who also have a game in hand, against struggling Empoli on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sixth straight win is the perfect boost Napoli need for another massive clash with Conte's old team Juventus, in Naples, this time next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another test for us, to see where we are," added Lukaku.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, goals in five second-half minutes from Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah gave Juventus a deserved win in Turin which pushed Thiago Motta's side up to fourth, a point ahead of Lazio who are at Verona on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeaten Juve snapped a run of three straight draws which had taken their tally of league stalemates to 13, with Saturday's win just their eighth in 21 fixtures in Italy's top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Weah emulated his father in the 64th minute by netting in a Juventus match with Milan 25 years after Ballon d'Or-winner George Weah did the same - for Milan against Juve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The boys are growing, match after match, and getting to the point that they can put in a performance like the one they did tonight," said Motta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because they all work really hard every day... today's win is the reward." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperamental Russian Daniil Medvedev was on Saturday fined US$76,000 over his behaviour at the Australian Open, where he destroyed a net camera, threw his racquet and skipped a post-match press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number five was penalised US$10,000 for a meltdown during his five-set first-round win against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej, when he mangled his racquet and ruined the camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced an even bigger penalty – $66,000 – over his antics in the next round when he crashed out to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the match he threw his racquet toward the sidelines, skidding across the court until it reached an advertising panel near his bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also argued with the umpire after being called out for repeated foot faults, then skipped his obligatory post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev had reached three of the last four Australian Open finals, including in 2024 when he imploded after leading by two sets, losing to Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyrie Irving scored 25 points as the Dallas Mavericks brought the high-flying Oklahoma City Thunder down to earth with a 106-98 victory over the Western Conference leaders on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City, riding high after their rout of Eastern Conference pace-setters Cleveland on Thursday, suffered just their seventh defeat of the season in a roller-coaster duel against a fired-up Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving was at the heart of the Mavs win, rattling in 17 points in a 41-point second quarter that allowed Dallas to open up a 64-43 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, who were missing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with a wrist injury, came roaring back to draw level in the third quarter before edging into a single-digit lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Mavs, who are still without the injured Luka Doncic, regrouped superbly to close out the win, outscoring the Thunder 29-22 in the fourth quarter to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas improved to 23-19 while Oklahoma City remain top of the West with a 34-7 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas coach Jason Kidd saluted his team's resilience in securing victory after watching a 20-point lead evaporate in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat in that third quarter," Kidd said. "We said on the bench we needed to stay the course, and stay together and in the fourth quarter we did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel like we have a talented team, and they have a talented team. So I thought tonight was a really good test for our group."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Friday, Jimmy Butler returned for Miami after serving a seven-game in-house suspension but was powerless to prevent the Heat from slumping to a 133-113 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic bagged his 17th triple-double of the season, finishing with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a comfortable victory for the 2023 NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Denver scoring with 30 points on a night when seven Nuggets players finished in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, who was suspended by Miami after indicating he wished to leave the club earlier this month, finished with 18 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Boston, Jayson Tatum scored 30 points as the NBA champion Celtics shrugged off their heaviest loss of the season to outclass the Orlando Magic 121-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, dominated 110-97 by lowly Toronto on the road on Wednesday, showed no signs of a hangover to complete a comfortable home victory at the TD Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando took a short-lived lead early in the first quarter but once Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown found their range, the result was never in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 30-point haul came from 12-of-21 shooting with four three-pointers, six rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porzingis finished with 23 points and Brown added 20, including a perfect 9-of-9 from the free-throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston improved to 29-12 with the victory to remain in second place in the Eastern Conference behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando's scoring was led by Cole Anthony with 23 points while Paolo Banchero continued his return from injury with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York meanwhile, Anthony Edwards erupted for 36 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves romped to a 116-99 victory over the Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edwards was on fire from outside the arc, making 8-of-13 three-pointers while Naz Reid also caught the eye with 6-of-6 threes in a 23-point cameo shift off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, the Bucks handed Toronto a reality check following their upset of Boston on Wednesday, with a 130-112 blowout at the Fiserv Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee swept to their third-straight win thanks to 35 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo and 26 points from Damian Lillard. The Bucks improved to 23-17 with the victory and remain in the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In San Antonio, Santi Aldama scored 29 off the bench as the Memphis Grizzlies overwhelmed Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs 140-112.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs star Wembanyama produced another big defensive performance with six blocks and a steal with 12 rebounds. But the Grizzlies' balanced offence proved too strong for the home side, with six players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

    Former Man Utd striker Denis Law dies aged 84

<img alt="Denis Law scored 237 goals in 404 appearances during an 11-year spell at Old Trafford until 1973, which places him third on United's all-time list. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788120_1_20250118152734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law has died at the age of 84, his family announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace," said the star's family in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law scored a total of 237 goals in 404 appearances during an 11-year spell at Old Trafford until 1973, which places him third behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton on United's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  He played 55 times for Scotland after making his debut at just 18 in 1958 and he remains his country's joint all-time leading scorer with 30 goals alongside Kenny Dalglish.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his time at United, Law won the first division title in 1965 and 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a cartilage injury forced him to miss the famous 4-1 thrashing of Benfica in the European Cup final at Wembley – a triumph that made United the first English winners of the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester United said the club was mourning the loss of "the king of the Stretford End" – the stand at Old Trafford where there is a statue of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players," United added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ultimate goalscorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently," his family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you." (AFP)

    Haaland signs bumper new Man City deal until 2034

<img alt="Erling Haaland has scored 111 goals in 126 games for Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788067_1_20250117224045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland has signed a new 9.5-year deal at Manchester City that will keep him at the Etihad until 2034, the Premier League champions announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old striker's existing contract was due to expire in June 2027 but he has now committed his future to the club for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal is the longest in the Premier League, eclipsing the nine-year contract Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year and Haaland's salary will reportedly be about £500,000 (US$610,000) per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post on the club's X account read: "Erling's here to stay! We're thrilled to announce Erling Haaland has extended his contract at City to 2034."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made an instant impact after joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, firing 52 goals in all competitions to help the club win a Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in his first season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored a further 38 goals last season as City won a fourth consecutive league title and his overall tally stands at 111 goals in 126 games for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club," said Haaland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years. They have made this such a special place to be and now I am City no matter what."
  <br>
  <br>
  City's outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain said: "Everyone at the club is absolutely delighted that Erling has signed his new contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact he is signed for so long demonstrates our commitment to him as a player, and his love of this club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has made an incredible impact already in his time here and his amazing numbers and records speak for themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's extension is a major boost for City in a season where they have unexpectedly struggled on the pitch, with the club sitting sixth, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also appears to be a huge show of faith from the player at a time when the club is waiting to learn the outcome of a major disciplinary case.
  <br>
  <br>
  City faced an independent commission hearing last year to examine more than 100 charges from the Premier League concerning alleged breaches of its financial rules, charges the club have always strenuously denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new contract renewal comes two months after Guardiola's decision to sign a new two-year deal of his own. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was pushed to the limit in setting up an Australian Open showdown with teenager Mirra Andreeva on Friday but Naomi Osaka's run ended with an injury retirement in round three.
 <br>
  <br>
  Women's World No. 1 Sabalenka was made to work hard behind a faltering serve before beating Denmark's Clara Tauson in the third round on Rod Laver Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was broken four straight times at the start of the match but found her groove to win 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 after more than two hours of attritional tennis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just super happy that I was able to just stay in the game and I was able to push myself, honestly, to the limit to get this win," said Sabalenka, who is chasing a rare third Melbourne title in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her win puts her into a clash against highly rated 17-year-old Andreeva, the 14th seed, who beat Poland's 23rd seed Magdalena Frech in three sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Andreeva announced her burgeoning talent by beating Sabalenka in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two-time Melbourne champion Osaka was on a collision course with American third seed Coco Gauff in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former world number one needed treatment on her stomach from the trainer during the first set against Belinda Bencic and called it quits after losing the opener on a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osaka, who was struggling with an abdominal injury in the build-up to the tournament and retired from the final in Auckland, was in the third round of a Slam for the first time since the birth of her daughter in 2023. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick as Manchester United roared back to beat Premier League basement club Southampton 3-1, narrowly avoiding a humiliating fourth straight home defeat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ivory Coast international – United's standout player this season – levelled in the 82nd minute before putting the hosts ahead in the dying seconds of the 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was still not done, capitalising on an error from Taylor Harwood-Bellis to grab a third in stoppage time, giving the scoreline a skewed look.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history, still with just one win to their name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Juric's men had deservedly taken the lead through a Manuel Ugarte own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diallo was once again the saviour for misfiring United following his winning goal at Manchester City and his late equaliser against Liverpool in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we showed at the end we were the best team," the winger said. "I am so happy for the win today because this team deserves it. I am ready to play every position where the manager likes to put me."
  <br>
  <br>
  United manager Ruben Amorim praised his forward, underlining his attacking threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He pushes the other team into the final third – that is really important," he said. "We didn't have a good game, but at this moment – winning is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  United secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool. (AFP)

    Medvedev stunned by teen qualifier Tien in Aussie Open

<img alt="Tien (L) speaks with Russia's Daniil Medvedev after his victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787918_1_20250117054531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Daniil Medvedev was dumped out in the Australian Open second round by 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien in a massive Melbourne shock at close to 3:00 a.m. Melbourne time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his debut Australian Open, the American ranked 121 stunned the world number five 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (8/10), 1-6, 7-6 (10/7) in a nailbiter and faces France's Corentin Moutet in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The left-handed Californian Tien soaked up the applause at Margaret Court Arena after the biggest win of his young career following four hours and 48 minutes of seesawing action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly it hasn't really set in yet," he said. "I'm just pretty happy to be off the court. I don't think I've played a match that long ever, or even spent that much time on a tennis court straight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I'm just glad to be off," he added. "Obviously really happy, but I don't think it fully hit me yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien had defeated Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli in five sets in the first round for his maiden victory at a Grand Slam at the fourth attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are my first two five-setters," said the gifted teenager, a known talent in tennis circles. "It is nice to feel that I can play these more physical matches and get through them."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a painful exit for Russia's former world number one Medvedev, who has lost three of the last four finals at Melbourne Park including to Jannik Sinner in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Medvedev needed five sets to beat the 418th-ranked Kasidit Samrej on Tuesday in his first match of the season, smashing his racquet and a net camera in a rage at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  He started more serenely against Tien but errors crept into his play and Tien shook off any early nerves by clinching the first set in 47 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien showed his mettle and his pedigree in the eighth game by prevailing in one gruelling 32-shot rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2021 US Open champion Medvedev and Tien went to a second-set tie break, where the Russian was left exasperated by a double foot fault on his way to losing the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third set again went to a tie break, where Medvedev pulled out an ace under excruciating pressure to save match point and then clinched the set at the third time of asking to come back from the brink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suddenly it was all Medvedev and he raced through the fourth set to tee up a decider. Tien appeared to have run out of steam.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from somewhere he located some extra reserves of energy and the duo exchanged breaks early in the fifth set.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was still time for another twist at 5-5 and 15-all on Tien's serve when a shower came, briefly holding up proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  They exchanged breaks of serve to go into a 10-point tie break, where there was again nothing between them until Tien finally sealed the deal on his second match point. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World No. 2 Iga Swiatek romped into the third round of the Australian Open on Thursday to set up a high-profile clash with 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Poland's Swiatek was racing past World No. 49 Rebecca Sramkova 6-0, 6-2 at the Rod Laver Arena, Britain's Raducanu was entering uncharted waters at the nearby Kia Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu had reached the second round in Melbourne on three previous occasions but never advanced further.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was forced to battle in a topsy-turvy match against her good friend Amanda Anisimova of the United States, with both players exchanging multiple breaks before the Briton came through 6-3, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Melbourne Park's centre court, Swiatek broke the Slovakian's opening service game and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova was playing in a Grand Slam second round for the first time and had no answer to the precision and power of the Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 64 percent of points off the Slovakian's first serve in an opening set that lasted 27 minutes, the Pole dropping just 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova finally got on the board in the eighth game of the match, to huge cheers from the a sympathetic crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Swiatek remained in control, closing out a comprehensive victory after exactly one hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt really solid today and it was a really efficient game," said Swiatek. "I'm happy that I kept my focus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu said she was looking forward to the challenge of playing against Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be a very good match for me," she said of facing the five-time Grand Slam champion. (AFP)

    Arsenal fightback sinks Spurs; Newcastle into top four

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a stirring fightback to beat Tottenham 2-1 in the north London derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Son Heung-min's early opener at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they seized the bragging rights against their bitter rivals thanks to Dominic Solanke's own goal and Leandro Trossard's strike just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's first win in four games in all competitions lifted them within four points of leaders Liverpool, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's game in hand on Arsenal still makes them title favourites, but the Gunners are at least applying some pressure on Arne Slot's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 2-0 by Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg last week and eliminated from the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, Arsenal were desperate for a response and Tottenham once again proved their ideal opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions have been asked of Arteta's ability to add more silverware to the 2020 FA Cup, which remains the only trophy of a reign that started in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka already sidelined due to hamstring surgery, Gabriel Jesus's potentially season-ending knee injury had added to Arteta's woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal have now won seven and drawn one of their last eight league games against Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team are now on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted," he said. "When you have opportunities to close the gap, you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was another painful blow for under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are just eight points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We let Arsenal dictate the game," Postecoglou said after the match. "Second half was a little better but nowhere near good enough – not acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou must find a solution to the inconsistency that saw them beat Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg before needing extra-time to see off fifth tier Tamworth in the FA Cup third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a win in their last five league games, losing four of those to drop to 13th place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raheem Sterling wasted a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead in the opening moments when his heavy touch allowed Djed Spence to clear after the winger raced through on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking wracked with nerves, Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky was fortunate not to gift a goal to Arsenal on his Premier League debut after taking too long to clear, with Kai Havertz unable to apply the finishing touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alexander Isak fired Newcastle into the Premier League's top four after scoring twice in a 3-0 cruise against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Isak found the net for the eighth league match in a row as the Magpies leapfrogged faltering Chelsea into fourth spot in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international put the home side ahead in the 34th minute when his shot took a huge deflection off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, leaving Jose Sa wrong-footed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak doubled Newcastle's lead shortly before the hour mark, controlling Bruno Guimaraes' pass before firing home for his 15th league goal of the season and Anthony Gordon added a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, who have now won six straight league games, have recovered strongly from a lengthy poor spell to make a powerful case for a Champions League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking advantage of the faltering form of Manchester City and Chelsea, they are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, David Moyes' return as Everton manager failed to muster a response from the toothless Toffees in a 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins' winner early in the second half lifted Villa up to seventh, just three points off the Premier League's top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, 16th-placed Everton are looking over their shoulders, just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of no wins and just one goal in his last five games in charge cost Sean Dyche his job as Everton boss. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Guangdong in the first leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only goal for the SAR, playing away at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangzhou, came in the 38th minute from captain Stefan Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made a run down the left flank and the ball was eventually crossed to Lau Ka-kiu in the penalty area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lee Man forward then passed it to Pereira, who took a shot that deflected off a defender, and found its way to the back of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong side had another chance to score after the break, as Alexander Jojo headed the ball from a corner kick but was denied by the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trying to respond, the home side ramped up their attacks in the second half and it paid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jojo was penalised for a handball in the box in the 74th minute, and Guangdong substitute Jiang Zhipeng nailed the penalty to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to score any more goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played at Hong Kong Stadium next Wednesday to decide the aggregate winner. RTHK will broadcast that match live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year marked the return of the competition for the first time since 2019, and Guangdong won it in a penalty shootout.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Zheng Qinwen was knocked out of the Australian Open in the biggest shock of the tournament so far, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka had to battle serve jitters to make the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fifth seed Zheng was sent packing 7-6, 6-3 at the John Cain Arena by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany, the second-oldest player in the draw at age 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over on centre court Sabalenka dropped her serve three times and faced 11 break points before overcoming Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, rattling off the last five games in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She played incredible tennis today and it was a really tough one. I expected this tennis from her, I'm really glad I was able to win this match," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win kept the Belarusian World No. 1 on course for a rare hat-trick of consecutive Australian Open titles, a feat last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis and only matched by four other women in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Olympic champion Zheng's attempt to become only the second Chinese player to win a Grand Slam singles title after Li Na is over, after being out-thought by the powerful Siegemund.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I just had to play more than my best tennis. I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free," said the German. (AFP)

 Liverpool's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two as Manchester City's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.

  Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win the 2015 to 2016 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could not have asked for more," said Liverpool manager Arne Slot. "Second half was outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong," he added. "Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."

  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had to settle for a second consecutive league draw, allowing Arsenal the chance to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long balls we won and we could run and in that moment we didn't take the right decisions," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "Maybe that would have been different but at the same time they had chances. Their strikers are really good, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are really dangerous."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night. They were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we deserved much more, especially in the first half," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The negative thing is that we changed how we played after conceding. The game was completely in our control and it's something we need to improve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Maro Itoje was selected on Tuesday as England's captain for the Six Nations rugby tournament, replacing Jamie George.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old lock takes the role for the first time, having previously deputised for George when the hooker has been replaced in the second half of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  George, who has had the armband since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, was demoted to vice-captain alongside Ellis Genge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itoje, who has 88 caps, was appointed as Saracens captain for this season, also ahead of George.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s a calm, influential leader, renowned for his commitment to upholding high standards and his ability to motivate those around him," England coach Steve Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His strong rapport with the squad and coaches, combined with his leadership experience at Saracens, makes him ideally placed to take on this responsibility," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borthwick has picked a 36-man squad for the Six Nations that includes No 8 Tom Willis, but is missing veteran prop Dan Cole and scrumhalf Ben Spencer. (AP)

<img alt="Houston Rockets guard Jalen Green scored 42 points against the Memphis Grizzlies at Toyota Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787438_1_20250114121505.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Green matched his career-high with 42 points and the Houston Rockets rallied from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 120-118 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jake LaRavia supplied the Grizzlies with a 100-87 lead when he stole the ball and sank a layup with 9:55 to play. The Rockets then began their comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were seven lead changes and two ties in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson posted 19 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two steals while teammate Alperen Sengun logged 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Cam Whitmore tallied 16 points and hit four 3-pointers off the bench. Houston made 16 of 31 from behind the arc and shot 50.6 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant paced the Grizzlies with 29 points but committed seven turnovers. Desmond Bane scored 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter for Memphis, which shot 52.9 percent but could not corral Green throughout the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston has won all three meetings with Memphis this season, two of them in the past five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 10 points as the Grizzlies jumped in from 18-11, but the Rockets answered with a 10-0 run that featured 3-pointers from Green and Dillon Brooks and yielded a 21-18 lead. Memphis responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Jaren Jackson Jr. 3-pointer that was part of a 12-2 close to the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies made 6 of 14 3-point attempts in the first and turned to their bench whenever the Rockets attempted to rally in the second. LaRavia scored 10 of Memphis' 24 first-half bench points, delivering a timely tip-in and a 3-pointer before a five-point surge from Whitmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green completed a four-point play that gave Houston a 55-54 lead, but Memphis scored the next six points and took a 60-57 halftime lead. (Reuters)

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) hands the ball off to running back Ty Johnson (26) in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787251_1_20250113101925.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen threw two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills trounced the Denver Broncos 31-7 to cruise into the next round of the NFL playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second-seeded Bills underscored their status as the biggest threat to Kansas City's hopes of reaching a fifth Super Bowl in six seasons by producing a dominant performance at their Highmark Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buffalo's wild card game victory sets up a blockbuster AFC divisional round clash next weekend against third seeded Baltimore, pitting Allen against the Ravens' reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great quarterback obviously with what he's able to do," Bills quarterback Allen said of his looming duel with Jackson. "He's one of the most dynamic if not the most dynamic quarterback in the league. He's fun to watch. But I'll be watching their defence this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen finished with 272 passing yards from 20-of-26 attempts, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with 46 rushing yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventh seeds Denver rocked Buffalo with a touchdown on the first drive of the game, quarterback Bo Nix finding receiver Troy Franklin with a deep pass for a 43-yard touchdown to mute the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills responded with 10 unanswered points, Tyler Bass slotting a 26-yard field goal and James Cook skipping into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver had a chance to tie the game on the stroke of halftime but Wil Lutz's 50-yard field goal attempt bounced back off the posts to leave Buffalo 10-7 ahead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills took a stranglehold on the game in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bass slotted a 27-yard field goal to make it 13-7, and after the Bills defense forced another Denver punt, Ty Johnson snagged a superb catch inches off the ground at the back of the end zone from Allen's pass to make it 19-7. A successful two-point conversion put the Bills 21-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen tossed his second touchdown pass at the start of the fourth quarter, picking out Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard touchdown that took the score to 28-7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's offense continued to be stymied by Buffalo's defense, their impotence summed up by a failure to convert a 4th&2 situation on their next possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen and the Bills took that opportunity to extend the lead to 31-7 with Bass's third field goal of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also means that the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will host the Houston Texans in the divisional round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles advanced in the NFC with a 22-10 win over a disappointing Green Bay Packers in a defensive grind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts returned after missing the past two games following a concussion and he showed no signs of rust with an early 11-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packers quarterback Jordan Love had a tough day, throwing an early interception with Darius Slay snaffling up the pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even when Love did manage to get Green Bay within field goal range, with a 13-play drive in the second quarter, Brandon McManus missed the kick from 38-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Love threw another interception at the end of the half and although McManus reduced the deficit with a 26-yard field goal in the third, Green Bay never looked in contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Goedert put Philadelphia 16-3 up when he collected a pass from Hurts and then burst towards the end-zone, delivering two stiff arms to keep Carrington Valentine at bay as he made the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josh Jacobs gave the Packers some hope with his one-yard rush after he had shown impressive power and strength on the previous play to break a series of tackles and make 31-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was the last productive moment from the Packers with two Jake Elliott field goals wrapping up the win for the Eagles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurts threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns while running back Saquon Barkley had 119-yards on 19 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how it looks and there's some things we can work on, improve on, the defence did a hell of a job and we got the win," said Barkley. (AFP)

 Julián Alvarez's strike helped Atlético Madrid move top of La Liga with 1-0 win over Osasuna.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side climbed one point clear of champions Real Madrid and six ahead of third-placed Barcelona at the halfway mark in the Spanish league season.

  Atlético claimed a 14th consecutive victory across all competitions, a new club record, and have lost just one top-flight game all season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their eighth straight league win and a fifth clean sheet from those matches, with Simeone's side back to their miserly best in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been doing a great job, we know that it's not over here and there's a long way to go, a lot of games to come," Alvarez said. "We have to continue on this path, to keep working with humility, and good things will come."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético started well against an Osasuna side with several regular starters left on the bench, including their top scorer, striker Ante Budimir.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antoine Griezmann had an early goal ruled out for handball, while his strike-partner Alvarez missed Atlético's best chances of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearest came when Rodrigo De Paul scooped a pass over the top for the Argentina international, but Alvarez's effort, which bounced awkwardly off his shoulder, was saved by Sergio Herrera.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Moreno's visitors, 11th, improved as the first half progressed and managed to keep Atlético largely at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  However early in the second half a clever Rojiblancos corner routine helped them break the deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griezmann's whipped cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger area by Clement Lenglet and Alvarez was able to slam home from close range for his sixth league goal since joining last summer from Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a move we've been working on, we've had some days to train, to make these strategies," explained Alvarez. "Luckily today it came off, it's important to score from dead balls, because it can be decisive, above all in hard-fought games like these, which are tricky."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were not at their sharpest but had more than enough to seal another victory and claim top spot, with Osasuna not troubling Jan Oblak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Getafe earned a 2-1 win at Las Palmas to climb three points above the relegation zone. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona hammered rivals Real Madrid 5-2 in a wild Spanish Super Cup Clasico final in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to win the first trophy of the Hansi Flick era.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead but a dominant Barcelona hit five in response before their goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to avenge their 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in October's La Liga Clasico but instead were left battered and bruised by their arch-rivals in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Mbappé's opener, Lamine Yamal levelled and Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead from the penalty spot, with Raphinha bagging a brace and Alejandro Balde also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo Goes pulled one back for Madrid with a free-kick but they could not capitalise further on their numerical advantage in a humiliating defeat for the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice, it had been a season since we won a trophy, it's always special and on top of that in a Clasico against Real Madrid," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde said. "We had a lot of calm and patience, knowing that if we applied the plan we would win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very proud and happy with the team," he added. "Right after the red card, we got together and said we were going to have to suffer, sit back, but we had a big advantage and this can't escape us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team's poor defending was the main reason for the heavy defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We defended badly and that cost us the game – they found their goals quite easily," Ancelotti said. "We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that – we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both coaches opted to maintain the same line-ups they started with in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal issued Madrid an early warning with a curling effort from the right which forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a strong stop to keep a Raphinha header at bay after the Brazilian evaded Lucas Vázquez with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Barcelona's opening salvo it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the fifth minute with Mbappé's brilliant goal on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward, frustrated numerous times by the offside flag in the league defeat by the Catalans, broke loose on the halfway line after Vinicius won the ball back and, after bursting into the area, clipped past Szczesny.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took a stunning individual goal from 17-year-old Yamal to level the scoreline, with the Spanish winger cutting in from the right before stroking home a low finish inside the near post in a similar style to former Barca great Lionel Messi, to whom he is often compared. (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes throws his boot to the ground after receiving a yellow card. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787219_1_20250113054123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten-man Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-3 on penalties after a dramatic 1-1 draw in the FA Cup third round, while Tottenham needed extra time before seeing off non-league Tamworth 3-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defeated 2-0 by Arsenal in the Premier League in December, FA Cup holders United exacted revenge on their return to the Emirates Stadium to extend their revival after last weekend's impressive draw at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's troubled side took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, who smashed a superb strike into the far corner from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  United defender Diogo Dalot was sent off for a second booking after fouling Mikel Merino nine minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed Arsenal's equaliser in the 63rd minute, the Brazilian defender swivelling to hit a low shot that took a hefty deflection off Matthijs de Ligt.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal wasted a golden opportunity to take the lead when Harry Maguire's soft challenge on Kai Havertz was ruled a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The furious United defender and team-mate Manuel Ugarte were involved in a melee with several Arsenal players before Altay Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard's spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz missed a host of chances to win it and the German was culpable again in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Bayindir, setting up the much-maligned Joshua Zirkzee to stroke home the decisive kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to pass through this round because we all suffered together and showed character," said Amorim, whose side host Leicester in the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few weeks ago Joshua was in a difficult moment, now he was a game-changer," he added. "Life has these beautiful things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another painful result for Arsenal after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg and last weekend's damaging league draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a thousand games like this you lose one," said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta, who hasn't won a trophy since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's unbelievable," he added. "We deserved to win the game by a mile. But the reality is we are out and the only thing that's going to be judged is that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham, who are currently 12th in the Premier League, are 96 places above Tamworth – who sit 16th in the fifth-tier National League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supposed gap in quality was rarely apparent as Tottenham's dismal display took them to the brink of a historic humiliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A part-time team whose players work day jobs alongside their football careers, Tamworth matched their highly-paid and supposedly superior opponents for long periods on the Lamb Ground's sloping artificial pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should have caused one of the FA Cup's greatest upsets in normal time but their missed chances proved crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Tshikuna's extra-time own goal and late strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson sent Tottenham into the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a major trophy in 2008, but the under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou boasts he always wins silverware in his second season at a club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having beaten Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Tottenham remain in contention for a domestic cup double despite a troubled season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They made it hard for us, with the surface it was about us staying calm and being persistent. In the end, we got the job done," said Postecoglou, whose team travel to Aston Villa in the fourth round. (AFP)

    Zheng Qinwen through at rain-hit Melbourne Park

<img alt="China's Zheng Qinwen (left) is congratulated by Romania's Anca Todoni after her victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787174_1_20250112151256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour's play was possible outside by early evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn't get any tennis," said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've paid 60 bucks and haven't seen anything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na's Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old's last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes," Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let's keep going playing with pressure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men's second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty nice, man. First time in my life I'm playing on a good court," the 20th seed said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it's much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Women's favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena. (Reuters)

    City crush Salford; Chelsea swat aside Morecambe

<img alt="Manchester City's James McAtee (right) celebrates after the match with Rico Lewis. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787147_1_20250112102441.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City dashed the dreams of Salford's former Manchester United star owners with an 8-0 FA Cup rout on Saturday, while Liverpool cruised into the fourth round with a 4-0 victory over Accrington Stanley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea were among the other big winners with a 5-0 demolition of Morecambe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford were the only Premier League side to fall to lower-league opposition as Plymouth, who sit bottom of the Championship, stunned the Bees 1-0 thanks to Morgan Whittaker's late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  League Two Salford have risen through the non-league ranks since investment from David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt began in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholes, Butt and director of football Giggs were in attendance at the Etihad but were denied a night to rival their best during glorious playing careers at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola made wholesale changes as Erling Haaland was afforded a rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku opened the scoring after just eight minutes before youngsters Divin Mubama and Nico O'Reilly made it 3-0 before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish scored his first City goal for over a year from the penalty spot, while Doku also netted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  But James McAtee, who had only scored once for City previously, earned man-of-the-match honours with a 20-minute second-half hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever," said McAtee.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was never any hint of an upset at Anfield either despite Arne Slot making eight changes for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold was named captain in the absence of Virgil van Dijk and led by example after being criticised for his display in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had warned the Premier League leaders that a trip to Anfield would be Accrington's "Champions League final".
  <br>
  <br>
  A mammoth 86 league positions behind Liverpool in the 92-team English league system, Stanley held out for nearly half an hour before Diogo Jota was left with a simple task to tap in from Darwin Nunez's low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander-Arnold then stepped forward to double the lead with a sumptuous hit into the top corner from outside the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could talk for hours about that (goal), unbelievable," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest compliment Trent could get was the reaction of everyone after the Manchester United game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player around the world, maybe except for a few, has a bad game and that is completely normal, but the moment Trent has one, everyone has an opinion about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayden Danns made it 3-0 before Federico Chiesa netted his first Liverpool goal after an injury-hit start to his time in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Felix was the star of the show for Chelsea as he got a rare chance to deputise for Cole Palmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese international and Tosin Adarabioyo both scored twice, while Christopher Nkunku made up for missing an early penalty by netting his 13th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only Liverpool have taken more points at home than Brentford in the Premier League this season, while Plymouth had not won away from home all campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet against the odds Argyle, who sacked former England captain Wayne Rooney 12 days ago, held out and hit Thomas Frank's men with a sucker punch when Whittaker blasted in from outside the area nine minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have pride in everybody, and I'm pleased for the supporters. It's a big day for us," said caretaker Plymouth boss Kevin Nancekivell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FA Cup brings that romance and we've put a little bit of history in it today by getting the win."
  <br>
  <br>
  High-flying Nottingham Forest continued their excellent season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Luton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were 4-0 winners at Norwich as Georginio Rutter struck twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth shrugged off the loss of strikers Evanilson and Enes Unal to long-term injuries this week to roar back from 1-0 down to hammer West Brom 5-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester went one better by hitting QPR for six in an eight-goal thriller at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' bright start under new boss Vitor Pereira continued as early goals from Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rodrigo Gomes secured a 2-1 win at Bristol City. (AFP)

    'It's great to be back': Moyes returns as Everton boss

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 David Moyes has returned as Everton manager following Sean Dyche's sacking, the struggling Premier League club announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "David is widely recognised as one of the Premier League's most experienced and accomplished managers, having led Everton for more than 500 matches from 2002 to 2013," a statement on the club's website read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that David is joining us at this pivotal time in Everton's history," Everton's executive chairman Marc Watts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With over a decade of experience at the club, he is the right leader to propel us through our final season at Goodison Park and into our new stadium. We look forward to working with David to build the foundation of a new era for Everton," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to be back! I enjoyed 11 wonderful and successful years at Everton and didn't hesitate when I was offered the opportunity to rejoin this great club," Moyes remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's new owners, the Friedkin Group, moved for Moyes after dismissing Dyche just hours before Thursday's 2-0 win against Peterborough in the FA Cup third-round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract to return to Everton 12 years after leaving for an unsuccessful spell in charge of Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 61-year-old Scot has been out of work since leaving West Ham at the end of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to start his second spell as Everton boss against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes remains popular with Everton fans after his 11-year stint in charge from 2002 to 2013, a period that included a fourth-place finish in 2005 and an FA Cup final appearance in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche's two-year reign came to an abrupt end on Thursday after Everton's defeat at Bournemouth on January 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Chelsea boss Graham Potter was said to be Everton's top target but he joined West Ham, with Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Fenerbahce in Turkey, also reportedly distancing himself from the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes will be tasked with leading Everton away from the relegation zone as they prepare to usher in a new era at their Bramley Moore Dock Stadium from next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche managed only one win in his last 11 games in charge, leaving them just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Everton defender Leighton Baines, now the club's under-18s head coach, and captain Seamus Coleman took charge for the win against third tier Peterborough. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gael Monfils became the oldest singles champion in ATP Tour history when the 38-year-old Frenchman swept to victory in the final of the Auckland Classic on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monfils outclassed Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs 6-3, 6-4, to eclipse Swiss great Roger Federer in the record books, a day before the start of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils powered to a 13th career title and became the oldest player to win an ATP final since the Tour launched in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federer was two months younger when he won the Swiss Indoors in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flamboyant Monfils roared and flexed to the crowd after clinching victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was proud to win at an age when others have usually hung up the racquet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Age is a number but I keep working," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I keep believing that I can play high quality tennis and I've been showing it this week so I'm very happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils won his first ATP Tour title in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was 20 years ago, I still have the passion to play tennis, I still feel like I strike a very good ball so hopefully many more to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot conditions, the Frenchman defied his age to play with greater athleticism than Bergs, who was contesting his first final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bergs dropped his serve early in both sets and lacked the firepower to break back against Monfils's clinical serve and varied groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils will rise 11 places to 41st in the world after his victory, taking the momentum into Melbourne, where he faces fellow Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round of the Australian Open. (AFP)

<img alt="An aerial view of burned homes from the fires near the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787085_1_20250111141806.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Lakers coach J.J. Redick says he hopes the team's eventual return to play can "give people hope" after seeing his Pacific Palisades home incinerated in the deadly wildfires that have ravaged the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers postponed a scheduled home game against Charlotte on Thursday because of the fires, which have left at least 11 people dead and destroyed around 10,000 homes and other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick oversaw practice on Friday for what was expected to be an emotionally charged home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, but that game too was postponed in a decision announced by NBA league chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers' game against Charlotte set for Saturday was also postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick is one of several members of the Lakers organization directly impacted by the fires, seeing his family's rented property in Pacific Palisades, the ground zero of the disaster, consumed by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Redick became emotional as he spoke to reporters about the personal impact of the disaster on his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years," said Redick, who was living in the house with his wife, Chelsea, and their two sons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was not prepared for what I saw," Redick said of visiting Pacific Palisades after returning home from the Lakers' road game at Dallas in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that stage, Redick's family had been evacuated to a hotel. The Lakers coach then paid a visit to his home early on Wednesday to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was complete devastation and destruction. I went a different way to the house through the village, and it's all gone," Redick said. "I don't think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick said his family had lost "irreplaceable" items in the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything that we owned that was of any importance to us in almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting was in that house." (AFP)

<img alt="West Ham's new coach Graham Potter watched his new side lose 2-1 to Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787064_1_20250111102337.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Graham Potter suffered a painful start to his West Ham reign as Aston Villa's late surge sealed a 2-1 win in the FA Cup third round on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Potter was hired by the Hammers on Thursday to replace Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked earlier this week after just six months in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former Chelsea manager was unable to make a winning return to the dug-out as West Ham squandered the first half lead given to them by Lucas Paqueta.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing evening at Villa Park, Unai Emery's men emphasised the size of the task facing Potter with a second half fightback that exposed West Ham's defensive flaws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amadou Onana equalised before Morgan Rogers bagged the winner to leave Potter holding his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Brighton boss is back in management for the first time since being dismissed by Chelsea in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter lasted less than seven months at Chelsea, losing 11 times in his 31 games in charge and slumping to 11th place in the top-flight despite a 288 million pound spending spree in his one transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter has tried to learn from the "pain" of that failure, vowing to "come back stronger" after an experience that may have cost him a chance at the England job when Thomas Tuchel was hired last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter had just one training session with his players before the trip to Villa and was without key forwards Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the circumstances, he can be encouraged by West Ham's attacking play but fixing their issues at the back must be top of his to-do list.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall, disappointed to go out, but lots of positives in the game," Potter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The start was really good but in the second half Aston Villa stepped-up and pushed us back a bit too much. That's something we will have to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third tier Wycombe enjoyed a surprise 2-0 win over Championship side Portsmouth in Friday's other third round tie. (AFP)

    'England should play Afghanistan cricket match'

<img alt="Lisa Nandy, the UK Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport says the game should go ahead. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787019_1_20250110211340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's upcoming Champions Trophy cricket match against Afghanistan should go ahead despite calls for a boycott over the Taliban's treatment of women, according to a senior British government minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  A group of more than 160 British politicians have called on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to refuse to play Afghanistan in protest at the women's sports policy of the Taliban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in 2021 the Taliban have effectively banned female participation – a move that puts the Afghanistan Cricket Board at odds with International Cricket Council (ICC) rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC, however, has allowed the Afghanistan men's team to continue to compete in global competitions, with England due to face them in the one-day international Champions Trophy in Lahore on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Cabinet minister Lisa Nandy said the match should be played amid concerns a boycott would see England docked points were they to forfeit the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think it should go ahead," Nandy, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added: "I'm instinctively very cautious about boycotts in sports, partly because I think they're counterproductive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they deny sports fans the opportunity that they love, and they can also very much penalise the athletes and the sports people who work very, very hard to reach the top of their game, and then they're denied the opportunities to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not the people that we want to penalise for the appalling actions of the Taliban against women and girls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ECB has resisted calls for a boycott, with chief executive Richard Gould saying instead he would "actively advocate" for collective action by the ICC instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  That position has been backed by Downing Street, with a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging the ICC to take the lead on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa, who are also due to play Afghanistan at the Champions Trophy, have backed the ECB's stance.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is despite veteran anti-apartheid campaigner and British politician Peter Hain, who played a key role in sparking his native South Africa's sporting isolation during the 1970s, calling for a boycott.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of the view that a more unified and collective approach from all ICC members will be more impactful," said Cricket South Africa president Rihan Richards. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mitch Jeter's 41-yard field goal with seven seconds left lifted Notre Dame to a 27-24 comeback win over Penn State in the Orange Bowl -- one of the College Football Playoff semifinals -- on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Fighting Irish won their 13th game in a row and advanced to the CFP national championship game, which will be played on January 20 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their opponent will be the winner of the Friday night Cotton Bowl match-up between fifth-seeded Texas and eighth-seeded Ohio State.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the first time Notre Dame has played for a national title since 2013 when it lost to Alabama in a game played in Miami Gardens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Gray's diving interception of a pass from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar with 33 seconds left set up the Fighting Irish's winning score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard completed 15 of 23 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and converted a key first down on the Fighting Irish's final drive to set up Jeter's game-winner. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland erupted for 40 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind to extend their unbeaten streak to 12 games with a 132-126 defeat of the Toronto Raptors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-four hours after their bruising win over the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cavs looked poised to suffer a huge upset after the Raptors opened up a 12-point lead late in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a late burst of scoring from Garland hauled the Cavs back into the contest, and a lopsided 34-23 fourth quarter sealed a battling victory for the Eastern Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland finished with 40 points from 14-of-22 shooting – 14 points coming in a fourth quarter flurry that swung the game decisively to Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson was left in no doubt as to the size of Garland's contribution to a win which leaves Cleveland leading the standings with a 33-4 record, six games clear of the reigning champion Boston Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He carried us," Atkinson said of Garland's performance. "This is the first game all year where I felt like one guy carried us. We weren't good but he single-handedly took over this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atkinson said Garland's performance was further proof of why he should be a shoo-in for next month's All-Star game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I respect the league but he's got to be in that top, All-Star tier," Atkinson added. "He's phenomenal. He completely took over the game and carried us."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donovan Mitchell missing from the Cavaliers line-up, Garland's scoring support came from Evan Mobley with 21 points while Jarrett Allen provided 18 points with 15 rebounds, two blocks and a steal to cap a fine all round display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other NBA games, the injury-hit Mavericks produced a late fourth quarter escape to grab a 117-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs, missing injured stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, looked headed for defeat after trailing by 10 points with just over four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But an electrifying 16-0 run flipped the script and set up an unlikely Dallas win. P.J. Washington led the scoring with 23 points and Dereck Lively added 21 to close out the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Orlando, meanwhile, Julius Randle finished with 23 points and Anthony Edwards added 21 as the Minnesota Timberwolves cruised to a 104-89 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, the Golden State Warriors held off the Pistons to dig out a 107-104 win on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buddy Hield led the Warriors scorers with 19 points while Stephen Curry finished with 17 after an uncharacteristically wayward shooting performance from long-range. Curry made only five-of-21 shots from the field, including only two of 14 attempted three-pointers. (AFP)

  Madrid have the chance to earn revenge for their heavy Clasico defeat in La Liga in October after Bellingham's clinical second-half strike sent them on their way to victory in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed heavily by fans in Jeddah Madrid never looked like letting the advantage slip and a stoppage-time own goal by Martin Valjent secured their win, with Rodrygo adding a late third from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid made the early running against last season's Copa del Rey runners-up, with Lucas Vázquez and Rodrygo coming close in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé appealed for a penalty after going down under pressure from Dani Rodríguez but it would have been soft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jagoba Arrasate's Mallorca found their footing and did well to restrict the Spanish and European champions to no further clear chances in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid lost Aurelien Tchouameni early in the second half after he hurt his head in a challenge with Cyle Larin, although he appeared frustrated to be withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute through Bellingham after the post and Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif kept Rodrygo and Mbappé at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  A blistering Madrid move bore fruit when Rodrygo's header from Vinicius Junior's cross hit the upright and Mbappé's effort was parried by the scrambling Greif.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham was in the right place at the right time to carefully slot home the rebound past defenders on the goal-line, continuing a stunning run of individual form.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international has eight goals for Madrid in his last 10 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca struggled to find a way back in and ended up contributing Madrid's second goal, when Valjent stretched to cut out a pass but slid the ball into his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo wrapped up the win late on to set up a repeat of last season's final, won by Super Cup holders Madrid. (AFP)

    Struggling Everton sack manager Dyche

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League strugglers Everton sacked manager Sean Dyche just hours before their FA Cup third-round tie against Peterborough.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speculation about Dyche's future had intensified with reports suggesting Everton's new owners, the US-based Friedkin Group, were talking to potential successors since completing a US$492 million takeover last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in a statement Dyche had been "relieved of his duties as senior men's first-team manager with immediate effect" after two years in charge, with the process to appoint a new boss under way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees are once again battling to avoid relegation from the Premier League after winning just one of their past 11 games, with that sole success coming against fellow drop candidates Wolves in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton Under-18s head coach Leighton Baines and club captain Seamus Coleman will take charge against third-tier Peterborough on an interim basis while the Liverpool side seek a permanent replacement for Dyche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Turkish club Fenerbahce, has recently been linked with Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho has experience of working with the Friedkin Group at Roma, although the Italian club sacked him just under a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes, who managed Everton between 2002 and 2013, ex-England coach Gareth Southgate, Brentford boss Thomas Frank and Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola are also among the reported contenders to succeed Dyche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have won only three times in 19 league matches this season and are languishing in 16th place, with only one point separating them from the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked earlier this week if the club were considering his position, Dyche's answer suggested he knew the sack could be looming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be clear, it should be," the former Burnley boss said. "At the end of the day, if you're a business of this size, succession planning should surely be part of their diligence – I've got no problem with that at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the noise has grown very powerful here, but we've had it before," he added. "The players haven't lacked effort, but it's obviously affecting them because you can see it in their performances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche took charge at Everton in January 2023 and kept them in the top-flight despite numerous issues, including last season's points deduction for breaching Premier League rules on profit and sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finished 17th in Dyche's first season, avoiding the drop with a victory against Bournemouth on the last day, and came 15th last term, extending their streak of being ever-present in English football's top-flight since 1954. (AFP)

    West Ham sack manager Julen Lopetegui

<img alt="West Ham manager Julen Lopetegui during a Premier League match against Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786725_1_20250109074010.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham sacked manager Julen Lopetegui after just 22 games in charge, with former Chelsea boss Graham Potter expected to replace him at the London Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers are 14th in the Premier League table, seven points above the relegation zone, after just six wins in 20 league matches during the Spaniard's tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 4-1 hammering at champions Manchester City on Saturday was the final straw for club chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, 58, took training as usual on Tuesday and reported for work on Wednesday to be officially told his spell in charge was over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "West Ham United can confirm that head coach Julen Lopetegui has left the club," the Hammers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first half of the 2024 to 2025 season has not aligned with the club's ambitions and the club has therefore taken action in line with its objectives," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were among the biggest spenders in the Premier League in the summer transfer window, splashing out around US$155 million on players including Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Fullkrug.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lopetegui won just one of his first six league games and oversaw several heavy defeats, including a 5-2 loss to Arsenal and a 5-0 drubbing by Liverpool, both at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Real Madrid and Spain boss was appointed in May last year to replace David Moyes, who left at the end of last season after a second spell at the London club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Scot, West Ham qualified for European competition for three consecutive seasons, winning the Europa Conference League in 2023 to secure the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, who had previously managed Wolves in the Premier League, said at the time of his appointment he had other opportunities but he was "very happy that West Ham chose me because I chose West Ham too".
  <br>
  <br>
  In their search for a replacement for Lopetegui, the club reportedly spoke to former AC Milan boss Paulo Fonseca and ex-Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Potter is the hot favourite to replace Lopetegui, with the club understood to have held talks with the former Chelsea and Brighton manager about becoming their new manager, initially on a short-term deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter, 49, has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea in April 2023, just seven months into a five-year contract. He won a mere 12 of his 31 matches in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Englishman began his managerial career at Swedish club Ostersund and had successful spells with Swansea and Brighton before taking over at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham face Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round prior to Premier League matches against Fulham and Crystal Palace. (AFP)

    Spurs snatch League Cup semi-final lead over Liverpool

<img alt="Lucas Bergvall celebrates after scoring his first goal for Tottenham. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786721_1_20250109070658.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lucas Bergvall condemned Liverpool to only their second defeat this season as the teenager's late strike earned Tottenham a controversial 1-0 win in the League Cup semi-final first leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bergvall struck with just four minutes left in north London, but Liverpool boss Arne Slot was furious that the Swede was still on the pitch to score his first goal for Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already on a yellow card, the 18-year-old had escaped a second booking moments earlier after tripping Kostas Tsimikas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsimikas was out of position after the tackle when Bergvall scored from an attack that started on the left flank vacated by the Liverpool defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's victory was a welcome tonic for Rodrigo Bentancur, who was taken to hospital after suffering a worrying injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur stooped to head a corner in the seventh minute and stayed on the ground after falling unchallenged. His team-mates showed immediate concern and play was stopped as Bentancur received medical attention for nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old was given oxygen through a mask during the treatment as a hush fell on the capacity crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  At half-time, Tottenham moved to ease fears over Uruguay star Bentancur, who only recently returned from a seven-game ban for using a racial slur about teammate Son Heung-min.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm Rodrigo is conscious, talking and will go to hospital for further checks," the club said in a statement on X during the half-time interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of Tottenham's spluttering form and his attacking tactics, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou claimed earlier this term that he always wins a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The under-fire Australian could do with backing up that boast given Tottenham's poor form in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a trophy when they lifted the League Cup in 2008 and the competition is shaping up as an opportunity to end that long silverware drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool won the League Cup last season in what proved to be Jurgen Klopp's last trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has taken Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and the Champions League since replacing Klopp, making this a rare flop from the Reds under the Dutchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result was Liverpool's first defeat in 24 games in all competitions since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in the league in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the only other loss endured by Slot this season and, following Sunday's disappointing 2-2 draw with lowly Manchester United, he is facing the first test of his prolonged honeymoon period on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second leg at Anfield on February 6 will decide who advances to the final. (AFP)

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

<img alt="Mavericks guard Quentin Grimes (5) celebrates with teammate Maxi Kleber. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786610_1_20250108122043.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quentin Grimes was the unlikely hero for Dallas as the injury-hit Mavericks out-classed LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 118-97 to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grimes came off the bench to score 23 points and grab nine rebounds, drilling six of the Mavericks' 18 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, last season's Western Conference champions, had gone 1-5 since losing Luka Doncic to a calf strain on Christmas Day. Still without the Slovenian star, they announced on Monday that Kyrie Irving would be sidelined for some time with a lower back sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by as many as six in the second quarter, the Mavs closed the first half on an 11-0 scoring run to take a 55-50 lead and never trailed in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 21 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Lakers and James added 18 points, 10 boards and eight assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Dallas out-rebounded the Lakers 44-33 and with 11 offensive rebounds managed 15 second-chance points to the Lakers' seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  P.J. Washington scored 22 points, Spencer Dinwiddie added 19 and Klay Thompson chipped in 13 for Dallas – who bumped the Lakers from fifth place in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew we had to get back on track," Grimes told broadcaster TNT. "Came out with the right mindset after dropping five in a row, so good to get back on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach JJ Redick said his team's inability to defend the perimeter was key.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the energy, It felt like we played a little tired tonight," he said. "When you're on the road and the other team is banging threes, it can be a little deflating to the overall energy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Anthony Edwards scored 32 points with nine rebounds to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-97 victory over the Pelicans, spoiling Pels star Zion Williamson's return from a two-month injury absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson scored 22 points with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Dejounte Murray led New Orleans with 29 points, but CJ McCollum had a rough night – scoring just five points on one-for-14 shooting. (AFP)

    Newcastle beat Arsenal in League Cup semis first leg

<img alt="Alexander Isak opened the scoring for Newcastle during their English League Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786563_1_20250108071526.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle took a giant stride towards the League Cup final as goals from Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon earned a 2-0 semi-final, first leg lead at Arsenal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies have never previously won the competition and have had to wait since 1969 to celebrate any major trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Isak they have the form striker in England right now and he rifled home the opener then helped tee up the second for Gordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have a mountain to climb when the sides meet for the second leg on February 5 if they are to progress to meet either Tottenham or Liverpool in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of silverware to both clubs was reflected in the line-ups, as Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe named their strongest available teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has brought Arsenal back into contention for Premier League titles in recent seasons, but his only trophy in charge of the Gunners came five years ago by lifting the FA Cup in the early months of his reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were able to welcome back Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli from the side that started the 1-1 draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's lack of a lethal striker like Isak proved the difference between the sides. Arsenal had the majority of the ball and the chances but failed to make them count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinelli came closest when he raced onto Leandro Trossard's pass and smashed against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later came the sucker punch. Arsenal, so renowned for their own set-piece threat, allowed a long free-kick into their box to fall at the feet of Isak who fired in off the underside of the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede's 14th goal in his last 15 games took him to 50 in a Newcastle shirt – doing so in five fewer matches than it took the club's record goalscorer Alan Shearer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak had a major role to play in what could be a decisive second goal in the tie just after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Newcastle striker's quick feet allowed him to get a shot off that was parried by David Raya into the path of the onrushing Gordon to fire in the rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal should still have made their mammoth task for the return leg in Tyneside next month a more manageable one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz somehow miscued a header wide with the goal gaping to cut the arrears. Howe replaced Isak and Gordon as Newcastle were happy to just to protect their lead in a 5-5-0 formation for the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, though, lacked the guile to break them down without the injured Bukayo Saka to seemingly extend their wait for Arteta's revolution to deliver another trophy. (AFP)

 Didier Deschamps, France's longest serving national team coach, will reportedly not seek to renew his contract which expires in 2026, according to the French Football Federation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deschamps' deal runs until after the next World Cup, for which Les Bleus have yet to qualify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old took over from fellow 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc in 2012 and led Les Bleus to the World Cup title in 2018, two years after reaching the European Championship final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former France captain, one of only three to win football's most prestigious prize as a player and a coach, guided the national team to the World Cup final again in 2022 – losing to Argentina on penalties after one of the best matches in the tournament's history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham have exercised the option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until June 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Son's deal, which he signed in 2021, was due to expire at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean, 32, joined the Premier League club in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen and has made 431 appearances, scoring 169 goals – fourth on Tottenham's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son was named club captain in August 2023, and shared the Premier League's Golden Boot with Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah in the 2021 to 2022 season after scoring 23 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also captain of South Korea, making 131 appearances to date and scoring 51 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the current season, he has scored seven goals in all competitions in a struggling Spurs side who are 12th in the Premier League table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham said the South Korea international had become a “global star” and a “modern-day great” in his time at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement of his extension came ahead of Tottenham's English League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool. (AFP/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 This year's Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition will highlight a roster of young players from the SAR, as Hong Kong, China aim to nurture a new generation of talent for international play.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of the tournament will take place at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangdong on January 15, while the SAR will host the return leg at Hong Kong Stadium on January 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darren Arnott, head coach of the youth divisions, will be leading the Hong Kong, China team of 37 players, with 29 of them under the age of 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), said on Tuesday that the experience will be crucial in encouraging young players to take on a key role in football development in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the main initiatives of the HKFA is to develop more young players and give them more opportunities to play and train. So under this strategy, we have a number of initiatives," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that at the last Asian Games at Hangzhou, it was mainly comprised of the youth team U-23. We had a historic result in the Asian Games, which showed that Hong Kong has a bright future and we have many good quality youth players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said the association has established a league for younger players and set up a training base in Guangxi to provide players with better facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong Stadium will host the second leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK will broadcast both matches live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that the HKFA is in discussions with Kai Tak Sports Park about the possibility of hosting the home games for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, starting with the match against India in June.

    Forest thump Wolves for sixth straight top-flight win

<img alt="Morgan Gibbs-White of Nottingham Forest tackles João Gomes of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786398_1_20250107063944.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015-2016 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths," he added. "It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better. It is well and truly too early to talk about a title challenge, we are not thinking about that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels, but the chances dried up for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed-up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Rugby Sevens in March will be held at the Kai Tak Stadium for the first time. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786277_1_20250106110908.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong China Rugby on Monday said the first Rugby Sevens tournament to be held at the new stadium in Kai Tak will be a next-level event.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, Hong Kong China Rugby CEO, made the comments after authorities said the first test event at the main stadium of the Kai Tak Sports Park went well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon said his operations team is now busy with debriefing and reviewing with stakeholders ahead of the Rugby Sevens, which will be held at the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Sevens is famous around the world, of course, as the event that every Sevens player wants to play in. And I think the first tournament in the new stadium is going to take that to an even higher level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said athletes and fans are excited about the new state-of-the-art venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players will be able to enjoy [the experience] in the much better surroundings of Kai Tak which is also more conducive to enhancing their performance slightly on the pitch, so that'll be great for the players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon noted that the stadium in Kai Tak was at 20 percent capacity during Sunday's test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the atmosphere we had, I think the fans are in for something really incredible" during the Rugby Sevens, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that the new South Stand will be bigger and would overlook the Hong Kong skyline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Probably the most unique feature in the stadium is the window looking out on the Hong Kong skyline on the South Stand terrace, and that's going to make the experience even more memorable for fans."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A dominant United States lifted their second United Cup mixed team tournament title in three years after they beat Poland 2-0, with Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz both winning their singles matches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seeds in the US$10 million tournament that began with 18 nations in contention clinched the trophy when Fritz defeated Hubert Hurkacz 6-4 5-7 7-6(4), after Coco Gauff outclassed Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans had also won the 2023 title in the inaugural edition of the tournament, which serves as a tune-up event for the Australian Open Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the second singles contest locked at one set apiece, Fritz raised his level at 3-3 in the tiebreak of the decider to see off Hurkacz and spark huge celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff earlier stepped up preparations for the year's first major that begins next Sunday with a second successive win over world number two Swiatek in a blockbuster showdown that gave fans at the Ken Rosewall Arena their money's worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number three, who beat Swiatek en route to the WTA Finals title last season, squandered a 2-0 lead in the first set but battled back from there to gain the upper hand in the match as her opponent counted the costs of 19 unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-octane set that followed, Gauff recovered a break to level at 4-4 and went on to secure the win that ensured she ended her singles campaign at the tournament unbeaten. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ousmane Dembélé scored a stoppage-time winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Monaco 1-0 to win the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The France winger was unmarked at the back post to meet a low cross from the left by Fabián Ruiz in the second minute of added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG won the trophy, also known as the French Super Cup, for a record-extending 13th overall. PSG won the league and cup double last season, with Monaco finishing second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The result reflects our domination,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said, while Monaco coach Adi Hütter conceded PSG played better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A goal in the last minute always feels like a knife in the back,” Hütter said. “PSG deserved to win if we're being honest, they had more chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match took place at Stadium 974 in Doha, Qatar, with PSG owned by Qatar-based QSI since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Désiré Doué hit the crossbar early on for PSG and Monaco goalkeeper Philipp Köhn made several saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monaco improved after the break and hit the post through Eliesse Ben Seghir and Brazilian defender Vanderson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Köhn made a fine save to deny Achraf Hakimi in the 74th minute, he failed to properly read Ruiz's cross and Monaco missed out on winning the trophy for the first time since 2000. (AP)

    Diallo earns Man Utd thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo came back to haunt Liverpool with a late equaliser that secured a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against the Premier League leaders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forward turned home Alejandro Garnacho’s cross in the 80th minute at Anfield after Mohamed Salah’s penalty had looked like giving Liverpool the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo struck at the end of extra time as United beat Liverpool 4-3 in a dramatic FA Cup clash last season and hit a 90th-minute winner against Manchester City last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  His goal was only worth a point on this occasion, but it halted United's four-game losing run and prevented fierce rival Liverpool from opening up an eight-point lead at the top of the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head coach Ruben Amorim, however, was still unhappy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s a point, a deserved point – but it’s just one point," he said. "We should get mad. Today we should be really disappointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  United led through Lisandro Martínez’s strike in the 52nd, but Cody Gakpo levelled seven minutes later. Salah fired Liverpool ahead from the spot in the 70th after Matthijs de Ligt handled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draw saw United move up to 13th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool missed the chance to open up an eight-point lead on second-place Arsenal, which drew 1-1 with Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds are still six points clear at the top with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the whole game we created more chances than them; a point feels like it’s something to take, but when I watch the game back I would hope for more,” Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  United is without a win at Anfield since 2016 – a run that spans nine matches in all competitions. But it was a first point for Ruben Amorim's team since the 2-1 win against Manchester City on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could have been better for United, with Harry Maguire firing over from close range deep into added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had its chances to win as well, with Virgil van Dijk firing a header straight at United goalkeeper Andre Onana late on.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 39 top-flight titles between them, this was the latest meeting between English football's two greatest teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool has the chance to equal United’s record total of 20 league crowns this season and could have taken a firmer hold on the title race with a win in front of its home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But United produced a performance that confounded its recent form, which has even had Amorim admitting his team could face a relegation fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been fairly criticised because the position in the table says it all," United captain Bruno Fernandes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s a fair result, both teams played really good football. But we can’t be satisfied," he added. "I’m really upset, because if we can show this against Liverpool – why can’t we do this every week?”
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund had chances in the first half before Martínez lashed a left-footed shot into the roof of the net from a narrow angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister had seen Liverpool’s best effort in the first half saved by Onana, but the keeper could do nothing to stop Gakpo’s powerful shot after cutting onto his right foot in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review led to referee Michael Oliver awarding Liverpool a penalty after the ball struck De Ligt’s arm and Salah fired low to score his 21st goal of the season. He has scored 13 goals against United – more than any other player in Premier League history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it wasn’t enough to earn Liverpool the win after substitute Garnacho cut the ball back for Diallo to convert.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The way we conceded the two goals was unacceptable, lazy and careless," Van Dijk said. "It shouldn’t happen.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Frenchman Alexandre Muller on Sunday earned a major confidence boost as he lifted his first-career ATP Tour finals crown after downing Japan's Kei Nishikori 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 to win the Hong Kong Tennis Open final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Muller, 27, fell behind early as Nishikori claimed the opening set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he refused to go down quietly, dominating the second and third to deny the 35-year-old Japanese of his 13th tour-level championship in an intense showdown lasting one hour and 43 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy to get a title here in Hong Kong," Muller told reporters in a post-match interview. "It's been a long and tough week for me, losing the first set in all the matches – so I'm just very happy about my first title."
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory caps off a stellar week of play for Muller, who is now projected to rise eleven places in the world rankings to a career-high 56th as he gears up to face Czech Jakub Mensik in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked how he would celebrate his maiden trophy, Muller kept it light-hearted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not the kind of guy who would go to nightclubs and stuff like this," he joked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe just a light dinner with my team, as I got my flight to Auckland tomorrow. That's tennis life – enjoying your title for a few hours before we go again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nishikori was competing in first final in six years. Speaking to reporters after the match, the world number 106 cited tiredness as one of the main reasons for the way he played in the second and third sets, but remained pleased in his overall performance nonetheless ahead of the Australian Open come January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very disappointed in how I played in the second and third," Nishikori said. "I think there are more chances to win a few matches in Australia, but I am still on the way."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can play good in some moments, but I still got ups-and-downs so I got to keep working on it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Dutchman Sander Arends and Briton Luke Johnson won the men's doubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  They dispatched world number eight Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov from Russia, 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 in an hour and 33 minutes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Runners who took part in this year’s Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon said they were happy with the arrangements after issues were raised in the event’s inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 people took part in Sunday's race, which covered the local section of the 55-kilometre mega-bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race for the challenge group of runners started at 7.15am, and the remaining three non-challenge groups began in batches about half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A runner from Yunnan, surnamed Jian, said she previously ran in the plateau and wanted to experience something different.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Running here is totally different. You're on the bridge and over the sea, while elsewhere it's just road running. I think the arrangement is pretty good. The volunteers are really enthusiastic and there are clear signs,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some runners who participated in the November 2023 race complained about not being offered enough sports drinks or snacks, as well as the lack of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s race is designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many elite marathon runners took part, including Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, who won the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner. “I'm happy to see so many runners cheering for me,” he spoke through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha came first in the challenge group in just over an hour, while Grace Nawowuna from Kenya took the women’s title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong See-yeung and Virginia Lo were the first SAR man and woman to finish the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong, who also ran in 2023, said the facilities, including the toilets, were much better compared with the previous race.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he was thrilled and honoured to be able to run alongside Kawauchi.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel very inspired because he is a role model for me. As an Asian athlete with a larger build similar to mine, he resonates with me. He started as a recreational runner and has achieved results comparable to, or even better than, professional athletes. This serves as a great motivation for us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, meanwhile, was about 40 seconds off her personal best. She said the overall experience was great, though the uphill tunnel section was the toughest part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law called the start of the challenge group race.
  <br>
  <br>
  She and other officials, including justice chief Paul Lam and security minister Chris Tang, took part in a special 2-kilometre race.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Midway through the race I noticed the sunrise is magnificent. So, it’s really half sports, half tourism,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates also told me that for future large-scale events, they plan to invite not just elite runners from abroad but also those who are overseas travellers. When they come, there’s no reason to just run the marathon – they'll likely stay a night and spend money. I totally support this idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, 19 runners said they felt unwell and suffered injuries and three were sent to hospital for treatment as of 11am.

    Ravens clinch AFC North, Bengals still alive

<img alt="Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens finishes the regular season with 4,172 yards passing and 915 yards rushing, the best combined record for an NFL quarterback. File photo: Tommy Gilligan-Imagn Images via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786202_1_20250105140836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamar Jackson threw two touchdown passes and the Baltimore Ravens won the AFC North for the second straight season, clinching the division with a 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the other NFL game on Saturday, the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens (12-5) will open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before winning its final four to finish on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pittsburgh, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow passed for 277 yards and a touchdown and Cade York kicked four field goals in Cincinnati's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burrow also threw an interception and his NFL record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns came to an end. But he did enough to propel the Bengals (9-8) to their fifth straight win and keep them in the mix until the season's final day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cincinnati will earn the seventh seed in the AFC if Denver loses to Kansas City and Miami either loses to or ties the New York Jets on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh is assured of playing next week despite a four-game losing streak. The Steelers will be the fifth seed if the Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, Pittsburgh will be the sixth seed and travel to rival Baltimore in the first round. (AP)

    City crush West Ham; Arsenal, Chelsea settle for draws

<img alt="Manchester City's Erling Haaland scores City's second goal past West Ham United's Alphonse Areola. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786172_1_20250105083027.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland and Manchester City might just be turning the corner after the team's worst run of results under Pep Guardiola.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haaland scored twice in a 4-1 win over West Ham on Saturday as City secured back-to-back victories in the Premier League for the first time since late October, when a shocking and unthinkable six-week meltdown began.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that time, the defending champions played nine league games and won just once, dropping them out of the Champions League qualification spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, City can hope for better times ahead - making up ground on second-placed Arsenal and fourth-placed Chelsea after they both dropped points in draws at Brighton and Crystal Palace, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Guardiola wasn't getting carried away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased for the result," he said, “but you cannot ask me if the old City is back. If you saw the game, we are not.”
  <br>
  <br>
  However, while the 2-0 win at Leicester last weekend was unconvincing, there were better signs against West Ham - at least in attack with Haaland looking sharp. The Norway striker headed in Savinho's cross to make it 2-0 in the 42nd minute and chipped the goalkeeper for 3-0 in the 55th after running onto another pass from Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Either side, there was an own-goal and a strike from Phil Foden before Niclas Fullkrug pulled one back for West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are still not like we were, for different reasons,” Guardiola said. "The result will help. We struggle but it is a release.”
  <br>
  <br>
  City stayed in sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, it was a good day for Liverpool - and the league leader didn't even play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were held to 1-1 at Brighton, which equalised from the penalty spot through Joao Pedro, and missed the chance to trim the gap to Liverpool to three points. Ethan Nwaneri put Arsenal ahead and, at age 17, became only the sixth player under 18 to score multiple Premier League goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's penalty was awarded after Arsenal defender William Saliba was adjudged to have clashed heads with Pedro as they challenged for a bouncing ball. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was disappointed with the call, saying: “I have never seen a decision like this in my career. I asked the boys if they have and nobody has seen it before.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's winless run in the league extended to four matches after drawing at Palace 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta equalised in the 82nd for Palace, cancelling out Cole Palmer's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have drawn twice and lost twice since December 22, damaging a title bid that had been picking up some steam, even if manager Enzo Maresca never accepted his team was a realistic challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still created so many chances in front of goal but it's about getting the end product," Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho said. “We're still playing the same football, we are still giving 100 percent. This is what happens in football.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead Arsenal by five points and Chelsea by nine, and have two games in hand over both rivals. The first comes at home to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak scored in a seventh straight Premier League game to earn Newcastle a 2-1 win at injury-hit Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker grabbed the 38th-minute winner and there was a hint of fortune about it, with Tottenham defender Radu Drăgușin getting the slightest of touches on a cross and deflecting the ball onto the foot of Isak. The ball dribbled into the net for Isak's 13th goal of the season, and ninth in his past seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Tuchel was in the stands in his first scouting mission in his role as the recently hired England coach. Two players likely to be in his first squad, to be announced in March for World Cup qualifiers, got on the score sheet in the opening six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham ahead in the fourth minute, and Anthony Gordon equalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a fifth straight win for fifth-placed Newcastle, while Tottenham stayed in the bottom half of the standings with just one point from their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were beaten by Brentford 5-0 at home for a third straight defeat under Ivan Juric, who was hired last month to replace the fired Russell Martin. Southampton have one point from four games under Juric and just six points overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo scored two of Brentford's goals and has 13 for the season in the league. It was Brentford's biggest ever win in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat Leicester 2-1, while Bournemouth won at home to Everton 1-0 and was eight games unbeaten - a club record in their time in the Premier League. (AP)

    Heat suspend Jimmy Butler and will seek to trade him

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat suspended Jimmy Butler for seven games on Friday and said they will seek to trade him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NBA team said the suspension was for “conduct detrimental to the team over the course of the season and particularly the last several weeks.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through his actions and statements, he has shown he no longer wants to be part of this team,” the Heat said in a statement, one day after Butler said in a post-game press conference that he does not believe he can be happy playing in Miami going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will lose about US$336,543 per game during the suspension, or about US$2,355,798 in all. He has the right to an appeal, which could lessen the financial hit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will not be with the team for its home game on Saturday against Utah and then the totality of a six-game road trip to Sacramento, Golden State, Utah, Portland, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In theory, the earliest that Butler could play again for the Heat is January 17 at home against Denver. But he has likely played for Miami for the final time. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seventeen-year-old sensation Luke 'The Nuke' Littler thrashed Michael van Gerwen 7-3 on Friday to become the youngest ever PDC darts world champion and bank a 500,000 pound (US$621,600) winner's cheque.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duel for the biggest prize in darts, in front of 3,200 rowdy fans in fancy dress, ended in a crushing defeat for three times winner Van Gerwen, 35, in his seventh final at North London's 'Ally Pally' Alexandra Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe it. Honestly, I can't believe it," gasped the teenager, tears in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon, whose meteoric rise started by throwing magnetic darts as a toddler, had finally achieved the dream after losing 7-4 last year in a final that made him a household name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We both played so well. I said in my interviews, I needed to get off to a quick start tonight and that's what I did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone dreams of lifting this trophy but you've got to get through a tough field."
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler took a cagey opening set and then found his rhythm with two quick 180s to go 2-0 up, winning six of the first seven legs, as Van Gerwen's finishing touch failed him and he grimaced in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen, who will walk away 200,000 pounds richer as runner-up, won the opening leg of the third set but it proved a false dawn as an implacable Littler raced 4-0 clear with a bullseye finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch 'Green Machine', who set the previous record for youngest world champion as a 24-year-old in 2014, showed he was still in the fight by taking the fifth set but the comeback faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler, hand steady and gaze unwavering, fired in quick back-to-back 180s to take the opening leg of the sixth and then banged in two more maximum scores to secure the set and forge 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen raised his game to pull back to 5-2 but Littler, who ended the tournament with the most 180s, whitewashed the next set to restore his advantage to 6-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another set to the Dutchman only postponed the inevitable as Littler, who turns 18 on January 21, romped through the final set to get his hands on the mighty Sid Waddell Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pent-up emotion was finally released by two bullseyes and a double 16 to check out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learnt a lot last year," he said as the celebrations died down. "Earlier today I watched all of the (2024 final) game back against Luke (Humphries) and I had the visions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could end 2025 winning absolutely nothing (more) but I've picked up one of the best."
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen said he had not done himself justice, and it hurt, "but that's the way it is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fair play to him. Every chance he got, every moment he had to hurt me, he did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sometimes say every 17 years a star gets born and he's one of them." (Reuters)

<img alt="Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo leads early NBA All-Star fan voting with 1.7 million votes. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785956_2_20250103074152.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is the early leader in fan balloting for the NBA All-Star Game, and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers seems well on his way toward extending his record and getting picked for a 21st time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first update on All-Star voting for this season's revised game was released saw Antetokounmpo as the overall leader with about 1.7 million votes. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokić of the Denver Nuggets is second overall with about 1.4 million votes, which tops all Western Conference players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball led East guards with 947,444 votes, with Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell second on 718,084 and Milwaukee's Damian Lillard third on 704,914.
  <br>
  <br>
  There won't be ten starters this year for the All-Star Game, which is set to take place on Febuary 16 in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  2025 marks the first year of a new All-Star format, one where there will be three games. The 24 All-Stars will be drafted into three teams of eight players apiece by TNT personalities and former NBA greats Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams will be entered into a four-team tournament, with the remaining squad being the team of NBA rookies and second-year players that wins the Rising Stars event on All-Star Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are two semifinal games, followed by the winners meeting in a championship game – with the first team to reach 40 points the winner of all three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be wildly different than last year, when the All-Star Game final score was 211-186 – the highest-scoring one in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voting continues through January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan voting makes up 50 percent of the All-Star starter selection formula, with media voting accounting for another 25 percent and voting by current NBA players counting for the remaining 25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ten players designated as starters – even though there technically will be at least 15 starters in the All-Star “games” – will be announced on January 23, and the reserves that will be selected by NBA head coaches will be announced on January 30. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andrey Rublev's Australian Open preparations took an unexpected hit as the top seed was dumped out of the Hong Kong Open in the second round by Fabian Marozsan on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the first Grand Slam of the year just over a week away, the Hungarian ranked 58th in the world won 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old faces China's Shang Juncheng, 19, in the last eight at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian Rublev, ranked eighth, was the defending Hong Kong champion and had been pursuing a 76th tour-level quarter-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no such trouble for second seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, who defeated Canadian qualifier Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-3.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elena Rybakina's Kazakhstan dumped defending champions Germany out of the United Cup with Alexander Zverev sidelined by an arm injury barely a week away from the Australian Open, while top seeds USA beat China to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Sydney, women's world number two Iga Swiatek led Poland into the last eight by winning a rematch of her 2023 French Open final against the Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain also progressed to the quarter-finals with Katie Boulter's dominant 6-2, 6-1 victory over Australia's Olivia Gadecki enough to guarantee they won their group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upset in Perth sent the Kazakhs into the semi-finals of the 18-nation tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixth-ranked Rybakina earned the first point for Kazakhstan, with the 2022 Wimbledon champion hammering Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev then withdrew from his clash against Alexander Shevchenko at the last minute with a bicep strain, leaving the 254th-ranked Daniel Masur to face him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He put up a brave fight but Shevchenko was too strong, powering home 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-2 despite a medical timeout in the second set, complaining about difficulty breathing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling in this heat, it was so rough," said the world number 78, who upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in group play on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a headache and my head was spinning, but I wanted to win this one." added Shevchenko. "After [losing] the first set, I knew I had to shorten the rallies and play aggressively."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other quarter-final, 2023 winners United States beat China thanks to singles rubber wins by Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Gauff beat Zhang Shuai 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, and Fritz then put the tie beyond the Chinese with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Zhang Zhizhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coco did such a good job putting us ahead and giving me the chance to come out and put us through," said Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a little bit of pressure because I didn't want to be the one who loses it for the team after Coco won all her matches this week," he added. "I played a really solid match – really happy with it." (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus celebrates after scoring his team first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785803_1_20250102053400.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal closed the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool to six points as Gabriel Jesus extended his hot-streak in a 3-1 win at Brentford on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Bryan Mbeumo's first-half goal at the Gtech Community Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal refused to be blown away on a wet and windy evening in west London as Jesus equalised before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian's sixth goal in his last four games after he scored just once in his first 20 matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli netted in quick succession soon after half-time to ensure Arsenal moved into second place above Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We won in a difficult stadium against a good opponent. The record they have here is incredible and when you go 1-0 down it makes it even harder," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially when you go a goal down early in the game it becomes a mountain to climb, but we remained patient," he added. "We had to manage the situation emotionally. We were very clinical in the box. Jesus's form is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding their 5-1 rout of Crystal Palace, the Gunners had spluttered through their last four league games with lacklustre draws against Fulham and Everton followed by a narrow win over lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's first Premier League game of 2025 provided compelling evidence that they are ready to compete in the title race with Liverpool, who have a game in hand on the north Londoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Runners-up to Manchester City for the last two seasons, Arsenal are unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, a revitalising run that now includes four successive wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can only win our next match and see what happens. It's not in our hands," Arteta said of chasing Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka sidelined for several months due to a hamstring injury, 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri made his first league start for Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz was absent after scoring Arsenal's winner against Ipswich, but Jesus ensured the German was not missed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal did not lose a single one of their 10 league London derbies in 2024 and they maintained their impressive record in capital clashes after surviving an early blow. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce led all players in fan voting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelce, whose romance with Taylor Swift brought the NFL to the attention of the pop megastar's legion of fans, finished with 252,200 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs was second overall with 250,082 votes and Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has helped the Commanders into the playoffs, was third with 242,352.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions led all clubs in total votes received, followed by the Minnesota Vikings, Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selections for the Pro Bowl Games rosters for the AFC and NFC are determined by a combination of voting by fans, players and coaches, with each group's vote counting for one-third of the tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL's all-star event will be staged February 2 in Orlando, Florida, for the second consecutive year as 88 players take part in skills competitions, including a flag football showdown with former NFL star quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning serving as coaches. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plymouth Argyle have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Wayne Rooney after just over seven months in charge, the second-tier Championship club said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rooney had replaced Ian Foster in May on a three-year deal at Plymouth. However, the team struggled under his leadership, failing to win away this season, and are bottom with 18 points from 23 games, four points adrift of the safety zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United and England forward oversaw 25 matches in all competitions before his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the second setback for Rooney in 2024 following his dismissal as Birmingham City head coach in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First team coach Kevin Nancekivell and club captain Joe Edwards will lead the team for our Championship match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day," Plymouth said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rooney added: "Plymouth Argyle will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to look out for and take interest in their results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Birmingham manager in October 2023 when they were sixth but sacked in January after they fell to 20th in the league.
  <br>
  <br>

 Josh Hart delivered his third triple double of the season on to spark the New York Knicks in a 126-106 victory at Washington that stretched their win streak to eight games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hart had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his ninth triple double with the Knicks while Karl-Anthony Towns had a game-high 32 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson and O.G. Anunoby each scored 18 points for New York, which improved to 23-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks led 59-57 at halftime over the Eastern Conference doormats, and pulled away in the third quarter and dominated the fourth to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We executed. We got stops and we played fast," Hart said. "We played to our strengths. Sometimes it takes us a little while to wake up – we always do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at New Orleans, James Harden sank four free throws in the final 17 seconds to give the Los Angeles Clippers a 116-113 victory over the host Pelicans – as the NBA's worst club dropped a 10th consecutive game to sink to 5-28 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norman Powell scored a game-high 35 points, while Harden added 27 as the Clippers improved to 19-13.

  Elsewhere, Chicago's Coby White had 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to spark the Bulls to a 115-108 overtime victory at Charlotte.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)
