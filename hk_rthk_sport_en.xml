<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

<img alt="France's scrum-half Antoine Dupont (centre) holds the trophy while celebrating. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795897_1_20250316063919.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France claimed their seventh Six Nations trophy in a record-strewn 35-16 victory Scotland on Saturday, shaking off their beautiful runners-up tag on a crisp evening at the Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus matched England's number of titles since Italy joined the championship in 2000 and did so in style, scoring 30 tries in a pulsating campaign to make sure they would not end up runners-up for the fifth time in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their only defeat came against England at Twickenham but Fabien Galthie's side put that 26-25 loss behind them by humiliating Italy before crushing Ireland despite losing their talismanic captain Antoine Dupont through injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts turned on the gas after the interval on Saturday, and prevailed through tries by Yoram Moefana (2), Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Thomas Ramos, who kicked the other points to become came France's all-time record points scorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland made a game of it and scored a try through Darcy Graham with Finn Russell kicking their other points.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who gave Galthie his second title after the 2022 Six Nations since he took charge in 2020, finished on 21 points with England second.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was party time at the Stade de France but Les Bleus only really got into their groove after the break, relying again on forward power to finish off a combative but limited Scotland team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont, who ruptured his ACL against Ireland, stayed with the squad and the mercurial scrumhalf received the loudest cheers as he watched from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  France started well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gael Fickou tore through the middle and set up fellow centre Moefana for a try between the posts while Scotland were down to 14 after Jamie Ritchie was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, however, suffered a blow when Peato Mauvaka was sin-binned for head-butting Ben White and the hooker look relieved when he heard the sanction was not upgraded to a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos slotted a penalty from under the sticks to beat Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points scored for France and give them a 13-3 lead. He now has 450 to his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors reduced the arrears when Graham touched down after collecting Russell's inside ball. The flyhalf converted and added a penalty to level the scores as French prop Jean-Baptiste Gros was sent off for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos, however, restored a slim advantage with a penalty on the stroke of halftime before giving away possession with a poor kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland's Tom Jordan went over after a superb Blair Kinghorn break but the try was ruled out by the TMO as the fullback was ruled to be in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielle-Biarrey scored a championship record eighth try in a single campaign after being set up by Romain Ntamack who had sprinted through the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came the bomb squad as Galthie sent five forwards on from the bench and Scotland cracked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos crossed the whitewash after another devastating rolling maul and Moefana, who bulldozed past Russell after Fickou's offload, claimed the bonus-point try. (Reuters)

    Ohtani hits home run in Dodgers' Tokyo exhibition game

<img alt="Superstar Shohei Ohtani sends the crowd wild with a two-run homer in the third inning. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795879_1_20250315205024.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani fever in Tokyo reached boiling point on Saturday as the Japanese baseball superstar hit a home run in his first game in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform in his home country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is in the Japanese capital with the World Series champion Dodgers to open the Major League Baseball season with two games against the Chicago Cubs next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old was in action as the Dodgers beat Japan's Yomiuri Giants 5-1 in a warm-up game at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed to its 45,000-capacity rafters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He gave the crowd what they were looking for, smacking a huge home run in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to see so many fans at an exhibition game," Ohtani told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It really made me feel like I was back in Japan for the first time in a while."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ohtani's first game in Japan since he helped his country win the World Baseball Classic two years ago in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was his first-ever appearance in an MLB uniform in his home country, having left Japan for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018 before joining the Dodgers in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yurie Sakamune, who was at the game with her husband Junji, said the couple had entered 10 times into a lottery to buy tickets and had paid 50,000 yen (US$335) in total after snagging a pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a dream," said the 30-year-old, dressed in a Dodgers uniform with Ohtani's name and number 17 on the back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been working every day to see Ohtani and I've put up with all the tough times for this. It's become like a life goal to see him."
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge cheer went up as Ohtani stepped up to the plate to open the game, drawing a walk from Giants starting pitcher Shosei Togo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He crushed the next pitch he faced, slamming a two-run home run into the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shohei, to be quite honest, in the last seven years has represented almost single-handedly the people of Japan," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for him to come back here in person, it's going to be an emotional night for a lot of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excitement has been building for Ohtani's visit, with around 500 fans waiting for the Dodgers to arrive at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more paid 2,000 yen (US$13) each to watch the team practice the following day, with Ohtani emerging for a brief workout lasting about 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slugger, who has been described as a modern-day Babe Ruth, gave fans more for their money against the Giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really cool," said American Dodgers fan Michael Artukovic, who travelled from his home in San Francisco just to watch the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is going on in our country where we're becoming insular.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to see this where people from all over the world are coming to a baseball game in another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers play another warm-up game against Japan's Hanshin Tigers on Sunday, before starting their two-game series against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of fans at the Tokyo Dome were wearing Dodgers uniforms, although there was also a smattering of support for the Giants, Japan's most successful team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atsuko Onuma said she was rooting for the Giants but said she had also come to see Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  She confessed she would have "mixed feelings" if he were to hit a home run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to see it but I also want to suppress that feeling," she said. (AFP)

    Norris on pole as McLaren lock out Melbourne front row

<img alt="Lando Norris says he knows Sunday's race conditions will be completely different to those during Saturday's qualifying. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795861_1_20250315171554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris clinched pole position on Saturday for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri as McLaren fired a warning shot to their rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In scorching hot conditions at Melbourne's Albert Park, world champion Max Verstappen came third in tense qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell will keep Red Bull's four-time world champion company on the second row. Lewis Hamilton will start in eighth on his Ferrari debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the perfect way to start the year. A big congrats to the team, everyone has done an amazing job to start with a one-two," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it is just quali, right? Let's see tomorrow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is extremely quick. When you put it together it is unbelievable, but it is hard to put it together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm never going to get ahead of myself, I'm confident the car is in a good place but we have never run it in the wet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecast for Sunday's race is for cooler temperatures and rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris eclipsed his rivals with a flying lap of one minute 15.096 seconds on soft tyres, 0.084sec ahead of Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy, great to start the year on the front row," said Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy with how qualifying went, but just not quite enough in Q3, but it is a long season so a good start," added the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe left a little bit on the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  No Australian driver has won their home race since Alan Jones in 1980, but that was a non-championship race before Australia was added to the F1 calendar in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who was the pole-sitter in 2023 and 2024, was three-tenths behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen is chasing a second win in Australia after his 2023 victory to kickstart his bid for a fifth consecutive world title, a feat only Michael Schumacher has achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  RB's Yuki Tsunoda will start a surprise fifth alongside the Williams of Alex Albon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Hamilton were a disappointing seventh and eighth with Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz in the other Williams filling out the top 10. (AFP)

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

    Sabalenka books Indian Wells title clash with Andreeva

<img alt="Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka shakes hands with USA's Madison Keys after winning their semi-final match at the Indian Wells Tennis. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795836_1_20250315123114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka avenged her Australian Open loss to Madison Keys on Friday, thrashing the American 6-0, 6-1 to book an Indian Wells title showdown with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Russian 17-year-old Andreeva showed plenty of poise in a 7-6 (7/1), 1-6, 6-3 victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek, ending the second-ranked Pole's bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hungry," said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge after Keys denied her bid for a third straight Australian Open title in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused, I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was riding a 16-match winning streak, couldn't get a foot in the door.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think tactically I played really great tennis," said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to "just keep her out of the rhythm".
  <br>
  <br>
  The mis-firing Keys finally held serve for 5-1 in the second, but minutes later Sabalenka sealed the win and lined up a shot at the WTA tour's newest sensation Andreeva in what 26-year-old Sabalenka quipped would be "kind of like an old mama playing against a kid".
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva beat Swiatek for the second time in as many tournaments, having stunned the Polish star in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who hadn't dropped a set in winning 10 straight Indian Wells matches, looked supremely confident as she dropped just one point in her first three service games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Andreeva who claimed the first break of the tense first set for a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva stepped up her attack and broke Swiatek to open the third, and she sealed the win with her third break of the set. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz reacts after winning his quarter-final match against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795712_1_20250314142648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals of the Indian Wells ATP Masters.
 <br>
  <br>
  On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he stayed on track in his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really difficult for me to start the match," said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He got a lot of chances in the first set," Alcaraz said. "I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults, including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Daniil Medvedev, runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat young gun Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune, a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in two hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023, when he won five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round. (AFP)

<img alt="Bruno Fernandes was decisive for Manchester United with his hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795685_1_20250314104926.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes netted a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday, while Tottenham bounced back to edge AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rangers knocked out Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-2 on penalties as Chelsea saw out a 1-0 home win against Copenhagen to ensure their place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two spot-kicks and a late arrowed finish from Fernandes sent Man Utd into the quarter-finals by a 5-2 aggregate margin against 10-man Sociedad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it," Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim said of his captain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  A 10th-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead at Old Trafford before Fernandes converted from 12 yards in the 16th and 50th minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Aramburu saw red shortly after the hour and Man Utd took full advantage with Fernandes rifling in a third three minutes from time and Diogo Dalot rubber-stamping an emphatic victory in injury-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side will meet Lyon in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals in either half from Wilson Odobert and James Maddison in London earned Spurs a 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert powered home following sloppy AZ defending to get Spurs level on aggregate in the 26th minute, after the first leg finished 1-0 to the Dutch side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maddison put the hosts 2-0 up three minutes into the second period with an arrowed finish before Peer Koopmeiners responded after the hour to level the tie again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert grabbed his second and Spurs' third on the night in the 74th minute to set up a quarter-final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times," Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing the first leg in Istanbul 3-1, Fenerbahce fought back at Rangers to win 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski produced two cute finishes in the 45th and 73rd minutes to force extra-time with the aggregate score locked at three-apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  But three missed spot-kicks by the Turkish side handed Rangers a 3-2 win in the shoot-out and a last-eight clash with Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall got the winner 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea through the Conference League quarter-finals at the expense of Copenhagen, 3-1 over both legs. (AFP)

    Swiatek cruises past Zheng to reach Indian Wells semis

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen of China 6-3, 6-3, avenging her Olympics semi-final loss to the Paris Games gold medallist, to reach the last four at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number two from Poland will get a chance to avenge another upset loss in the semi-finals, where she'll take on Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who stunned her in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek delivered another dominant performance as she continued her bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who won her first Indian Wells title in 2022, could also join Martina Navratilova as the only women to lift the trophy in back-to-back years.
  <br>
  <br>
  After dropping just two games in each of her first three matches, Swiatek was broken twice as she faced her toughest test so far, but secured the victory with a flourish as she broke Zheng at love in the final game after a brief shower paused play late in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek converted all five of her break chances. Zheng twice surrendering her serve in games she led 40-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng did manage late breaks in each set, but neither those hiccups nor the brief shower that paused play in the second set proved much impediment to Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end it got really windy, which made it super tricky," Swiatek said. ""When the conditions change during the match you need to adjust quickly and it's not that easy. I'm happy that I was pushing until the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek admitted she was pleased to avenge her Olympic defeat, a heartbreaking loss on the Philippe Chatrier court where the Polish star has won four French Open titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not nice to lose to anybody, so for sure you want to have a little, like revenge, but it's nothing personal," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She can settle another score against Andreeva, who kept her bid for another prestigious title on track with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Ukrainian veteran Elina Svitolina. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Angus Ng was sent packing at the All England Open in Birmingham, losing to Singapore's Loh Kean Yew in straight games in the round of 16 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng came off an impressive victory over Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, coming from a game down in the last 32 to advance 19-21, 21-16, 21-12.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the SAR shuttler once again struggled against Loh, having lost all four of their previous encounters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng conceded the opening game 15-21, before falling 4-10 behind in game two. The Hong Kong representative stormed back to level things up at 14-all, but eventually succumbed to a 17-21 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loh will next face China's world number one, Shi Yuqi, who beat Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-19. Shi is the favourite in Birmingham following Victor Axelsen's surprise exit earlier on Thursday.

<img alt="Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was the star for Oklahoma City yet again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795528_1_20250313112112.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder punched their ticket to the playoffs with an impressive 118-112 victory over the reigning champion Boston Celtics in a potential NBA Finals sneak preview.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander enhanced his credentials as favourite for the Most Valuable Player award with a superb performance to silence Boston's TD Garden home crowd in an absorbing duel settled by a burst of fourth-quarter Thunder scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian point guard shot 11-of-20 from the field to finish with five rebounds, seven assists and 34 points, including 10-of-11 from the free throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City to 54-12, and guaranteed their place in next month's playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's win over a vastly more experienced Boston line-up marked another mature display from a Thunder side that is the youngest in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City effectively sealed victory late in the fourth, pulling away to open up a double-digit lead with just under two minutes remaining after Cason Wallace nailed a superb 24-foot three-pointer followed by a driving reverse layup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander said the Thunder's defensive solidity amid a barrage of 63 attempted threes from Boston had provided the foundation for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops, and that's been the trend for us recently," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're coming down the stretch against a good basketball team with good players, you've got to find a way, and we did so tonight and gave ourselves a chance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Gilgeous-Alexander grabbed the scoring headlines, the towering Chet Holmgren caught the eye with a double-double of 23 points with 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all the know the player Chet Holmgren is," Gilgeous-Alexander said of his 22-year-old team-mate. "He's a stud, and he's going to be stud for a very long time. He'll continue to grow and continue to be special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City's balanced offense meanwhile suggests that they are well-equipped to make a deep run in the postseason as they pursue the franchise's first NBA title since 1979, when the club were the Seattle SuperSonics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite missing Jaylin Williams from the line-up, the Thunder finished with seven players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston's scoring was led by Jayson Tatum with 33 points, while Derrick White had 22. Jaylen Brown though had an off-night, shooting 5-of-15 from the field before fouling out in the fourth quarter with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his team had failed to deal with Oklahoma City's physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of moments where we matched that and there were a few where we didn't, and I think stuff like that's the difference in the game," he said. (AFP)

 Former badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen suffered a shock first-round defeat to Chinese Taipei's Lin Chun-yi at the All England Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lin came out of top after a back-and-forth first game before Axelsen dominated the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane was not able to keep that form in the decider, however, as Lin reeled off six points in a row on the way to a 21-19, 13-21, 21-11 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I don't play my best, everyone can win against me," said Axelsen, the current world number four. "Today's opponent played a fantastic game, it was disappointing but that is how it is."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just tried to survive in the match," he added. "There is always a lot of pressure when I am here at the All England and every single day, and I got tense when my body was feeling bad and it affected my entire game."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid produced a gritty display to reach the Champions League quarter-finals with a 4-2 win on penalties against rivals Atlético Madrid, following a 1-0 defeat after extra time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side outplayed the record 15-time champions at the Metropolitano stadium for much of the game, but Madrid have never been eliminated by Atlético in the competition and they battled hard after Conor Gallagher's first-minute opener to secure a 2-2 aggregate draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thibaut Courtois made several saves to thwart Julián Alvarez and Vinicius Junior blazed a penalty high and wide for Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez scored for Atlético in the shoot-out, but his effort was ruled out as he touched the ball twice because of a slip as he shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Llorente also missed for Atlético and Madrid's Antonio Rudiger struck the winner for the reigning champions, who will face Arsenal in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played an average match at home, and here, we came out as if it was already won and in the first move they scored a goal against us, and that messed us up a lot," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We went to penalties, by the end we were very tired – it was very noticeable, and thank God we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético played with caution in the first leg despite trailing, willing to take a single goal deficit back to the fiery Metropolitano stadium, where they believed they could really turn the heat up on their arch-rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid knocked Atlético out in the 2017 semi-finals in the final European game at the Vicente Calderon, with this the first time the derby has been played at Atlético's new home in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  After defeats by Madrid in the 2014 and 2016 finals, the latter on penalties, and elimination on every other occasion the teams have met in the competition, Atlético were desperate to change the narrative, but came up fractionally short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It hurts, I think we played a great match, but unfortunately we lacked a bit of luck," Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. "The truth is that one feels pain, it hurts a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético came flying out of the blocks and took the lead after just 27 seconds through Gallagher, levelling the tie on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul's low ball in from the right was not cut out by Raul Asencio and former Chelsea midfielder Gallagher lunged in to beat Courtois from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were content to sit deep and soak up pressure as Real Madrid pushed the ball around in their territory but were also ready to spring forward on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Courtois saved on three occasions from Alvarez, who had scored a brilliant goal in the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSV Eindhoven to complete an emphatic 9-3 aggregate win and set up a quarter-final clash against Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners demolished the Dutch champions 7-1 in the Netherlands last week, making the second leg at the Emirates a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who made seven changes from Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester United, were quickly out of the blocks, scoring in the sixth minute through Oleksandr Zinchenko.
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian veteran Ivan Perisic pulled PSV level on the night with a fine finish past the sprawling David Raya but midfielder Declan Rice headed Arsenal back in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSV, seeking to salvage pride after last week's humiliation, equalised with 20 minutes to go with a well-taken goal from Couhaib Driouech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who have never been crowned European champions, will play 15-time winners Real Madrid in the last eight after Carlo Ancelotti's side squeaked past Atletico Madrid on penalties following a 2-2 draw on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have met just twice previously, with Arsenal winning 1-0 on aggregate in the round of 16 in the 2005/06 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the club should enjoy the achievement of reaching back-to-back quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, when Arsene Wenger was manager of the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That tells you the difficulty of it," said the Spaniard. "We have to value that and recognise that it is very difficult to do it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've done it consistently and now we want to make the next step, which is going to be really difficult, but we are very capable of that," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Darius Garland scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795390_1_20250312121604.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland scored 30 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a double-digit comeback to bag their 15th straight victory with a 109-104 defeat of the Brooklyn Nets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland looked to be heading for a shock loss after lowly Brooklyn raced into an 18-point lead in the third quarter against a Cavs line-up missing the rested Donovan Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Garland produced an explosive late burst of scoring to haul Cleveland back into the contest and extend the Cavaliers' lead at the top of the Eastern Conference to 55-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen of Garland's points came in the fourth quarter after the Cavs had cut the Nets lead to eight points at the end of the third thanks to a remarkable 49-foot three-pointer from Craig Porter Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porter's buzzer-beating heave from half-court left Cleveland trailing 86-78, and Garland then took over with a dazzling fourth-quarter display to see the Cavs home to the delight of the Rocket Arena crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was the fifth time this season Cleveland have overturned a deficit of 15 points or more to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  A weary Garland admitted though he would have preferred an easier path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sick and tired of comebacks," Garland joked after the win. "But we play hard for 48 minutes. We weren't shooting the ball the best so our defense took a stand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This team is a really good unit – we stick together through the good times and the bad times," he added. "We were all locked in through the fourth quarter – that's when we put our hard hats on and go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson saluted Garland's game-winning late charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the clutch player of the year," Atkinson said. "He just does it for us in the fourth quarter – he's done it for us all year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland received scoring support from Jarrett Allen, who had 13 rebounds and three blocks as well as scoring 23 points, and Evan Mobley who added 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The loss was hard on Brooklyn, who went into the game fresh from Monday's upset win over the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas led Brooklyn's scoring with 27 points while Cameron Johnson added 17 as the Nets fell to 22-43 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm proud of the guys because the first half was impressive," Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. "I just wish we would have been rewarded with a win." (AFP)

    Woods' major season in doubt after surgery

<img alt="Woods says he expects to make a full recovery after undergoing surgery. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795356_1_20250312082550.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tiger Woods revealed he had undergone surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon, derailing the veteran golf superstar's comeback plans in the latest injury setback to rock the twilight of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured," Woods said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, Dr. Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally-invasive Achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods added a comment from Stucken, who said the surgery "went smoothly and we expect a full recovery".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods gave no timetable for his possible return from his latest debilitating injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the recovery time from an Achilles rupture can often last several months – which would almost certainly rule Woods out from playing in any of this season's majors if his latest injury follows the same timeframe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 15-time major champion hasn't teed it up in a tournament since the Open Championship last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  After another back surgery in September he did play alongside 15-year-old son Charlie in the PNC Championship family event in Florida in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has also played in the TGL indoor simulator league he launched with Northern Ireland star Rory McIlroy this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 49-year-old, still hampered by serious leg injuries he suffered in a 2021 car crash, hasn't played a regular PGA Tour event since the Genesis Invitational in 2024 -- when he withdrew early because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods had committed to play in this year's Genesis Invitational but withdrew because he was "just not ready" days after the death of his mother, Kultida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods's latest injury setback comes less than a month before the first major of the year, the Masters at Augusta National. He finished 60th at the Masters last year and missed the cut in the year's other three majors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the litany of injury problems that have dogged him in recent years, Woods has repeatedly spoken of his desire to continue playing golf at the highest level, albeit with a scaled back tournament schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll play as long as I can play and I feel like I can still win the event," he said ahead of last year's British Open at Royal Troon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in December following his back surgery in September, Woods maintained that the "fire still burns to compete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference is the recovery of the body to do it is not what it used to be," he admitted. "That's part of age and part of an athlete's journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he acknowledged that he was uncertain about how much he would be able to play in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether my commitment going forward is once a month, yeah, I could say that all over again, but I truly don't know," he said. "I'm just trying to rehab and still get stronger and better and feel better, really give myself the best chance I can going into next year." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain produced a historic turnaround to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals at Liverpool's expense as they triumphed 4-1 on penalties after a 1-0 second leg win at Anfield.
 <br>
  <br>
  Never in Liverpool's history had they lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from home but Ousmane Dembele's early strike brought the French champions level at 1-1 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG were then perfect with their four spot-kicks, while Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique said before the game that the winners would progress to the final and PSG will be supremely confident of reaching the semi-finals at least as they will face Aston Villa or Club Brugge in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  A famous victory for the Parisians was deserved over the tie after they dominated the first leg only to be denied by the brilliance of Alisson Becker in the Liverpool goal before Harvey Elliott snatched a late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The roles were reversed early on and Liverpool were made to rue not making more of their chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brilliant play by Alexis Mac Allister should have created the opener on four minutes when the Argentine's cross picked out Mohamed Salah, whose goalbound effort was deflected over by Nuno Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah sliced wide another good chance on one of the few occasions he got the better of the determined Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG took 10 minutes to ride out the storm from the home side before finding their feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors took the lead on 12 minutes when Ibrahima Konate could only turn Bradley Barcola's cross beyond Alisson to leave Dembele with a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French international has now scored 23 goals in his last 17 games and could have had more before the end of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konate nearly made amends immediately when his low shot was turned behind by Donnarumma.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was PSG who had the better openings to extend their advantage before half-time. Twice Alisson had to be at his sharpest to race off his line and save one-on-ones against Barcola and Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG beat Liverpool to the signing of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January and the Georgian proved a constant menace to the Reds' defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kvaratskhelia's shot from Dembele's cross was arrowing towards the top corner until a deflection from Ryan Gravenberch took it just over the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved second-half performances have been a common theme of Arne Slot's first season at Liverpool and the hosts came roaring out of the traps after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominik Szoboszlai had a goal ruled out for offside against Luis Diaz earlier in the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szoboszlai then had a goalbound effort blocked by Willian Pacho before Donnarumma made a vital stop from Diaz from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's momentum could have been halted by the loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold to a knee injury after the right-back landed awkwardly.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his replacement, Jarell Quansah, was inches away from winning the tie when his header came back off the inside of the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG barely threatened during the second half of the 90 minutes but Liverpool were left hanging on for penalties in extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Beraldo's header and Desire Doue's shot flew just wide before more Alisson heroics kept PSG at bay with a stunning stop to turn Dembele's curling effort round the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Alisson could not save them in the shootout as it was the other goalkeeper who was the hero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma produced great saves to deny Nunez and Jones, either side of four confident strikes from Vitinha, Goncalo Ramos, Dembele and Doue to send PSG into the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the day's other results, Inter Milan are set to face Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals after seeing off Feyenoord 2-1 to complete a comfortable 4-1 aggregate victory. (AFP)

 Lamine Yamal and Raphinha dazzled as Barcelona thumped Benfica 3-1, reaching the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted either side of a stunning Yamal strike as the Catalans dominated in the first half, building on their 1-0 last 16, first leg win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Otamendi had quickly levelled Raphinha's opener but the visitors were blown away at the Olympic Stadium as Barcelona progressed comfortably from the tie and produced some moments of brilliant attacking football.

  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side will face Borussia Dortmund or Lille in the quarter-finals as they aim to win the competition for the first time since 2015 and the era of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are candidates to win everything," Raphinha said, with the club in the hunt for a potential treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me the most important thing is what we did as a team and I am very happy with this victory," he continued, before praising teenager Yamal. "His goal was spectacular, it shows what Lamine is – he's a spectacular player with tremendous quality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick said Barca would play for late club doctor Carles Minarro, who died suddenly on Saturday ahead of the team's match against Osasuna, which was postponed, and the players observed a silence in his honour before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened made us arrive at this game even more determined to win," added Raphinha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five-time Champions League winners Barca took the lead after 11 minutes when Spain international Yamal burst into the area, chopped his way past Florentino and then mishit the ball across to Raphinha for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica levelled within two minutes when Otamendi escaped Ronald Araujo to head home from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny excelled in the first leg as the Catalans claimed an impressive win with 10 men after Pau Cubarsi's red card, but might have done more to keep out Otamendi's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  However Barcelona, and particularly their wingers Yamal and Raphinha, were in sensational form and they quickly reclaimed their lead. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Tuesday announced plans to build a new 100,000-capacity stadium that co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said would be the "world's greatest" football ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League club have been examining whether to redevelop their historic Old Trafford home or build a new stadium in the same area.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have now confirmed their "intention to pursue a new 100,000-seater stadium as the centrepiece of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area" as they throw their "support behind the government's growth agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scaled models and conceptual images for how the new Old Trafford and surrounding area could look like were revealed on Tuesday at the London headquarters of architects Foster + Partners, appointed in September to design the stadium district.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford," Ratcliffe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport." (AFP)

    'Snooker hiccup not a problem for National Games'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans Pelicans will become the first NBA team to play in Australia when they tip off in two pre-season games in October, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both matches, against Melbourne United and Melbourne Phoenix, will be played at Melbourne Park, best known for hosting the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The significance of this announcement for basketball in Australia and the NBL can't be overstated," Larry Kestelman, owner and director of Australia's National Basketball League, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hosting an NBA team in Australia has been a long-held dream for everyone at the NBL and to see this initiative finally come to fruition after a 15-year journey shows that much can be accomplished when you 'dream big'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pelicans, who feature two-time NBA All-Star Zion Williamson and top point guard Dejounte Murray, will be in action on October 3 and 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an exciting moment for our organisation and a testament to the growing global impact of the NBA," said Pelicans president Dennis Lauscha.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bringing the Pelicans and NBA to Australia for the first time is a proud milestone, and we are thrilled to be part of this unique opportunity to engage with fans in Melbourne," he added. (AFP)

    Newcastle sink West Ham to boost top four bid

<img alt="Bruno Guimarães put Newcastle in front early in the second half. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795186_1_20250311070727.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle reignited their bid to qualify for the Champions League as Bruno Guimarães sealed a controversial 1-0 win at West Ham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil midfielder Guimarães struck in the second half as West Ham's claims for a foul in the build-up were ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side are up to sixth place in the Premier League, level on points with fifth-placed Manchester City and two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top four berth will guarantee Newcastle return to the Champions League after missing out this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even finishing fifth could be enough to ensure qualification for Europe's elite club competition depending on the results of the remaining English clubs in continental action.
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing three of their last four matches, the Magpies' restorative victory was perfectly timed ahead of their second League Cup final appearance in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, beaten by Manchester United in the League Cup showpiece in 2023, face Premier League leaders Liverpool in the final at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tyneside club are aiming to win their first major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and their first domestic prize since the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our best wins of the season, not in terms of performance but desire and heart," Howe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt we were in need of a win to go into the final with a real boost. It will do us the world of good," he added. "Also for our league table position today was vital."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham boss Graham Potter added: "We didn't do enough to win the game but we could have got something out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goal was disappointing, we felt there was a push on Kilman," he said. "It's two hands on the back. You can see from Isak's non celebration he thinks it's a push. Clear for us, but I'm not VAR." (AFP)

<img alt="Three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic finished one assist shy of a triple-double in the defeat. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795042_2_20250310082123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander outdueled MVP rival Nikola Jokic with a 40-point performance as the Oklahoma City Thunder produced a late barrage to defeat the Denver Nuggets 127-103.
 <br>
  <br>
  A pulsating battle between the NBA Western Conference heavyweights was settled by a fourth quarter offensive onslaught from Oklahoma City, who outscored Denver 41-20 in the final frame to romp to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander – widely seen as the front-runner to succeed Jokic as the league's Most Valuable Player – was instrumental in the Thunder's strong finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifted Canadian point guard once again came up big when it mattered, slamming the door on Denver after the Nuggets had got to within one point of OKC at the start of the fourth quarter after clawing their way back from an 11-point deficit in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added nine points in the fourth quarter to complete his 11th 40-point of the season, putting the Thunder within touching distance of clinching their place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder are now 53-11 at the top of the Western Conference after their seventh straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops down the stretch and then just execute," Gilgeous-Alexander said of the Thunder's fourth-quarter bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what it's going to come down to when teams are so good. It's never going to be pretty all the time but if you get stops and execute you'll give yourself a chance no matter who you play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Remarkably, Gilgeous-Alexander's 40-point game came despite him making just two of 11 three-point attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 26-year-old shrugged off his struggles from long range by attacking the rim to keep the points flowing for OKC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's where it all starts – easy baskets," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN. "That's my comfort zone. I didn't make as many shots as I wanted to, but we got a win so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander meanwhile shrugged off the hype surrounding his head-to-head with reigning MVP Jokic, the Serbian star who came into the game fresh from a historic triple double of 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists in Friday's win over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love MVPs, I love All-Stars, I love all the things that come with it but none of it matters if you don't win," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "That's where I hang my hat."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander received scoring support from Jalen Williams with 26 points, while Chet Holmgren added 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokic meanwhile finished with 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, with Michael Porter Jr. also adding 24 points. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma made a combative 76 to back up a potent spin bowling display as India beat New Zealand by four wickets to win a record third Champions Trophy title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chasing 252 to win, India got off to a fast start through their captain's first half-century of the tournament before KL Rahul hit an unbeaten 34 to help seal victory with six balls to spare in the final in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  India added to their trophies in 2002 and 2013 to go past Australia, who have two titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number's one ODI team, India finished unbeaten in the eight-nation tournament played in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very nice," Rohit said. "We played some good cricket though the tournament. To have the result our way is a great feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been amazing, we wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour. Lovely playing with a bunch of amazing youngsters," star batsman Virat Kohli said. "They're stepping up and taking India in the right direction."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you leave, you want to leave in a better position. So many impactful knocks (Shubman) Gill, Shreyas (Iyer), Rahul have played. The team is in good hands," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Kohli and Rohit had a lean run of form in India's 3-1 Test defeat in Australia earlier this year and the pair came into the tournament with speculation swirling over their ODI retirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a battle of spin on a sluggish Dubai pitch, New Zealand's bowlers put India in trouble at 203-5 with Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit 48, back in the pavilion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rahul kept calm and along with Hardik Pandya (18) and Ravindra Jadeja, who hit the winning boundary, steered the team home to loud cheers from a largely Indian crowd in a sea of blue.
  <br>
  <br>
  India played all their matches at the Dubai International Stadium after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan due to political tensions. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Declan Rice's equaliser denied Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim a much-needed win but Arsenal's faltering Premier League title challenge suffered another damaging blow in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners sit 15 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, now with just one game in hand, with their focus beginning to turn to holding off the chasing pack for a place in next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes' stunning free-kick put United ahead in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils, though, could not hold on for just a sixth Premier League win in 16 games under Amorim as Rice swept home on 74 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  United missed a string of late chances to win the game, with a point leaving them down in 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How we conceded chances in certain moments was not acceptable," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "They have so much quality and they pick the right player and normally that would end in a goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We opened the gate to lose the game. There was no chance to lose the game and we opened it ourselves," he added. "I will defend my players all the time but in those moments we have to do better."
  <br>
  <br>
  United have had three permanent managers and an interim during Arteta's five years in charge of Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said he knows he will not get the time Arteta did to turn around a sinking ship at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discontent among the home support could be seen around the stands with many taking part in a protest by wearing black over what they perceive as "the death" of their club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This club will never die, that is clear," said Amorim. "You feel it in the streets. This is a big business and maybe all the fans in this league sometimes feel it is harder to go to the games and pay for tickets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had failed to score in either of their previous two league games to realistically wave goodbye to their hopes of a first title in 21 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite still missing the attacking quartet of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, the Gunners hit back in stunning fashion to thrash PSV Eindhoven 7-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infused with fresh confidence, Arsenal started on the front foot but again missed the focal point of a natural centre-forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Midfielder Mikel Merino has been forced to deputise up front in recent weeks and fired wide from the edge of the area with an early opening.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have struggled for goals all season, but their skipper has remained a source of inspiration and Fernandes produced once more with a sumptuous free-kick just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions will be asked over Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya's starting position, but Fernandes still had to whip the ball over an imposing wall and back down into the visitors' net. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Neil Robertson from Australia won the 2025 World Snooker Grand Prix on Sunday, delivering a dominant performance by whitewashing Stuart Bingham from England by a score of 10-frames-to-nil.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was Robertson's second championship title at the World Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final began at 1 pm, with Bingham already down 8-0 by the end of the first session.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Awlam, shared that this was his first time watching a snooker match, and he was excited about the whole experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Yes! Nice! It’s actually very nice. I’ve been here every day except for one. The sports park is absolutely amazing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The whole development, including the stadium, the arena, the malls, and everything around it, is really impressive. I am very happy to see this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spectator, Mr Chan, remarked that it was a great experience to watch snooker at the Kai Tak Arena, where the atmosphere was fantastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s big and beautiful; it’s quite nice. And it’s close to the MTR station.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match resumed at 7:30 pm, and Robertson continued his impressive performance, winning two straight games and defeating Bingham 10-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, an exhibition match took place between Hong Kong's top player, Ng On-yee, and world number one Mink Nutcharut, with Nutcharut winning 2-0.

    Fans enjoy the atmosphere on the final day of LIV Golf

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Many fans told RTHK the all-star player roster was a big draw for them. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795008_1_20250309201219.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators were immersed in what felt like a party-like atmosphere on the third and final day of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament, as the second edition of the event wrapped up in Fanling on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fans told RTHK that the large number of star players included in the LIV Golf draw – a field that included six-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2024 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau – helped bring more fans to the historic Hong Kong Golf Club course.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Mok, who was at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling last November, said it was a big step-up from last year's inaugural competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in the past, you might get one or two top names," he said. "Obviously, most of the LIV Golf roster are top players who won multiple majors. And I think that in itself is very attractive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also commended the accessibility for fans and families travelling to the tournament, which he said helped draw much larger crowds than he expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Promoting [the tournament] is one thing, but it also needs to be accessible," Mok explained. "There's an effort to make it participatory, rather than just putting up the names. The big events will sell themselves, but giving people the chance to access it in an equitable way would be great."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from Argentina, surnamed Caceres, shared his experience as a first-time spectator at a major golf tournament in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people in Hong Kong love their sports and these kinds of events," said Caceres, who attended both the second and final day of the competition. "There's rugby, tennis, and now golf events – and every time I go, lots of people [are attending]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many young fans came to support some of their favourite players.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local fan who was at last year's edition of the tournament, surnamed Nandwani, was at the event to see Australia's Cameron Smith in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People come in [from overseas] to watch this event. I think it's just a great thing to have... it's a great thing as a whole for the community to show up."

<img alt="Fireballs GC came out on top in the team standings. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795006_2_20250310070148.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sergio Garcia of Spain on Sunday carded a seven-under 63 to take home the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament crown in Fanling, as the 45-year-old claimed his second career individual title on the men's golf tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard kickstarted his bid for a maiden victory in the SAR with an impressive early eagle on the par-5 third hole, before recording four consecutive birdies on the 8th to 11th holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-time international tournament winner added a fifth birdie on the 16th to seal the three-shot victory in a thrilling final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My goal at the beginning of the day was to shoot five under," Garcia said after his individual win. "It was solid. I played very well, I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll admit I had a couple of bad swings, but I managed to get away with them and recover nicely," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garcia edged out Dean Burmester of South Africa and American Phil Mickelson, who finished 15-under-par and 14-under-par respectively, to round out the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the festivities for Garcia didn't stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Fireballs GC, led by Garcia, came out on top of the Team event – securing a double for the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team finished one stroke ahead of Stinger GC, who carded a 37-under-par.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nice to see that not only was I doing well in leading the tournament, but also that my teammates were playing great," Garcia said of his team, which includes last year's LIV Golf Hong Kong champion Abraham Ancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull off a double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them – so I'm very proud of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the sports minister, Rosanna Law, who attended the event, and LIV Golf say they strongly intend to make the tournament an annual showcase in Hong Kong. Law said the sides are close to an agreement, but they're still working out the details.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament in Hong Kong was the third stop of the LIV Golf 2025 season, before it heads to Singapore from March 14 to 16.

<img alt="Liverpool's Egyptian striker #11 Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring the team's third goal from the penalty spot. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794946_1_20250309085129.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool needed two Mohamed Salah penalties to beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 3-1 on Saturday, while Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool stretched their lead at the top to a massive 16 points, despite a lethargic first 45 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from a 1-0 Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool boss Arne Slot made just three changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Dutchman was forced into making three half-time alterations to kickstart the champions-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The manager was like going for us - but that's something you need sometimes. Because first half, the game was sloppy," said Salah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton have taken just nine points from 28 games all season, but stunned Anfield when Will Smallbone fired the visitors in front in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alisson Becker was Liverpool's hero at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday but the Brazilian and Virgil van Dijk got in each other's way to allow Smallbone to roll into an unguarded net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot turned to Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister and Andy Robertson at the break, and the changes had the desired effect with two goals in three minutes before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darwin Nunez levelled with a sharp near-post finish from Luis Diaz's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nunez was then upended inside the area and Salah converted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian slotted home a second penalty two minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 32 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have two games in hand on the leaders, the first of which comes away to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it appears a matter of when not if Liverpool will clinch just their second league title in 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest pulled four points clear of City in third thanks to Callum Hudson-Odoi's late winner at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Chelsea winger fired past Ederson on 83 minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White's pass to spark jubilant scenes of celebration as Forest beat the English champions for the first time since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time European champions, Forest have not experienced the continent's top competition since 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are closing in on the Champions League with a top-five finish almost certain to be enough thanks to the strong performance of English teams in Europe this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not here to joke", Hudson-Odoi posted on social media. "Goal, MOTM (man-of-the-match), three points!"
  <br>
  <br>
  City remain fourth and are looking over their shoulders after a ninth league defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men are likely to be overtaken by Chelsea, when they host struggling Leicester on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa closed to within two points of the top four as Ollie Watkins came back to haunt Brentford once more in a 1-0 win in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken let the England striker's effort fly through his legs on 49 minutes as Watkins struck for the sixth time in six games against his former club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton boosted their own Champions League hopes courtesy of Joao Pedro's 98th-minute penalty to beat Fulham 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raul Jimenez's strike opened the scoring for Fulham, but Jean Paul van Hecke levelled before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedro's spot-kick lifts the Seagulls to sixth and within one point of City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace shrugged off the loss of top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta to a serious ear injury to beat Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Ismaila Sarr's winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles have won nine of their last 11 games in all competitions and climb to 11th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves edged six points clear of the relegation zone after a 1-1 draw against Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marshall Munetsi cancelled out Jack Harrison's opener for the visitors at Molineux as Everton extended their unbeaten league run to eight games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to give his side a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and keep them on track for a top-four finish and prized place in next year's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winger picked up a glorious diagonal pass from Morgan Gibbs-White before running into the box and beating City goalkeeper Ederson at his near post from a tight angle in the 83rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a game of few chances, Pep Guardiola's City team came closest when Nico Gonzalez's long-range shot scraped the outside of the post, while Hudson-Odoi saw a curled effort pushed onto the post by Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result kept this season's surprise team Forest third on 51 points, with City in fourth place on 47. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 It’s a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament in Fanling going into the final round on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three players finished the second round on Saturday on eleven-under-par and hold a three-stroke lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Day one leader Paul Casey of England remains on top. Joining him is Sergio Garcia of Spain and Peter Uihlein of the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American made a huge charge for the lead, hitting an eagle and eight birdies, but he also had four bogeys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big names, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson was three shots off the lead, alongside Sebastian Muñoz of Columbia and Chilean Mito Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryson DeChambeau, the current US Open champion, is tied in 7th place with seven others, including 2010 US Open champion Graeme McDowell and two-time major winner Jon Rahm of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion Abraham Ancer put in a much better performance, shooting five-under-par on the day and is now tied in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the team competition, Torque G-C are on top with a three-stroke lead.

 Two former world champions, Shaun Murphy of England and Neil Robertson of Australia, put on a show for fans at the Kai Tak Arena on Saturday.

  <br>
  Robertson narrowly edged out Murphy in the deciding frame to move into the final of the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Australian was down 5-3 at one point but fought back, finishing the final frame with his third century break of the match to win the best-of-eleven match 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other final spot will be decided later on Saturday evening, when world number one Judd Trump takes on fellow Englishman Stuart Bingham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two have previously met 37 times, with Trump winning on 26 occasions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers staged a dramatic late rally to stretch their unbeaten streak to 13 games with a nail-biting 118-117 over the lowly Charlotte Hornets in the NBA on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte, buoyed by a stellar 46-point display from Miles Bridges, looked ready to score a massive upset after opening up a nine-point lead with just over five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who this week became the first team to punch their ticket to the postseason, rallied superbly to claw their way back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sensational Evan Mobley three-pointer tied it for the Cavs at 106-106 with just over two minutes remaining, before Donovan Mitchell put the Cavs into a winning position with six straight free throws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 24 points while Darius Garland finished with 20 and Mobley 19 as the Cavs improved to 53-10. Cleveland lead the East by eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bridges almost single-handedly inspired Charlotte to what would have been a remarkable upset. Only two other Hornets players finished with double figures as Charlotte fell to 14-48 to remain one place off the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said his team's determination to dig out victory augured well for the looming playoff campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirteen in a row – I think yes, we're in a good groove," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to scratch and claw these last couple of games, which is great for playoff prep – playing in some tight games and having to execute at the end of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our group's in a really good place. It did feel like our energy was a little bit down, but when our energy's high, it's really tough to beat us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder extended their lead at the top of the standings after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 107-89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault could afford to rest Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Williams and Cason Wallace, but they were still too strong for an outgunned Blazers lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Wiggins led the Oklahoma City scoring with 30 points, while Jaylin Williams posted his first career triple-double with 11 rebounds, 11 assists and 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  OKC improved to 52-11 and lead the West by 11 games from the second-placed Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Denver, Nikola Jokic made history en route to equalling his career-high tally of triple-doubles for a season as the Nuggets downed the Phoenix Suns 149-141 in an overtime thriller.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic finished with 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists to complete his 29th triple of the season. It marked the first time ever a player has scored more than 30 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns, desperately needing a victory as they chase a place in the play-in tournament, rallied back brilliantly from 21 points down in the third quarter to tie it up when Kevin Durant drained a three-pointer on the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jokic took over in overtime to close out a victory that leaves the Nuggets third in the West on 41-22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Memphis Grizzlies halted their four-game skid with a 122-111 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, who were without the injured Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant sparked the Grizzlies with 31 points, while Desmond Bane added 27 points, 16 rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies are fourth in the West with a 39-24 record, while Dallas fell to 32-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Miami, the Minnesota Timberwolves' balanced offense was enough to secure a 106-104 victory over the Heat, with seven T'Wolves players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

    Top-seeded Zverev crashes out in Indian Wells opener

<img alt="German Alexander Zverev in-between points during his match against Tallon Griekspoor. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794847_1_20250308081214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two and top seed Alexander Zverev was sent crashing out of Indian Wells on Friday as he was beaten 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/4) by 43rd-ranked Tallon Griekspoor.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, heading the field of the prestigious ATP Masters event with world number one Jannik Sinner serving a three-month drugs ban, is the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opener since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat in a tension-packed Stadium Court thriller continues a lackluster run for Zverev since he fell to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then the German had made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev saved five match points in a tension-packed 12th game of the third set, finally converting his fifth break point of the game to force the tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Griekspoor sealed it on his first chance in the decider, and the Dutch player was delighted to get it over the line against a player who beat him four times last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griekspoor next faces France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the 29th seed who was leading 6-4 when Hungrian Fabien Marozsan retired from their second-round match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev said the Italian's enforced absence had at first had him harbouring ideas of climbing to the top. But they are fading with his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now it's less, because I'm just playing terrible," said Zverev, who made early exits at Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Acapulco before his disastrous Indian Wells showing.
  <br>
  <br>
  He's the first Indian Wells men's top seed to lose his opening match since Andy Murray in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to find my game before thinking about that, because to become world number one you have to win tournaments," Zverev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not past getting first, second round at the moment. So I need to figure that out first." (AFP)

<img alt="Liu Guoliang says this year's World Table Tennis finals may be held in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794723_2_20250307131416.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park will promote sports development and exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, according to senior Chinese sports officials attending the "Two Sessions" in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Jinqiang, vice president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said athletes from the national team who attended the sports park's opening last week were very impressed with the new facility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If possible, of course we hope to organise some international events and sports exchange activities between Hong Kong and the mainland at the sports park," Zhou told RTHK on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou also said preparations for the National Games are going well, adding that it will be an important milestone in China's development as a leading sports nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's National Games will be co-hosted by Guangdong, Macau and Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu Guoliang, president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association and also a CPPCC member, highlighted Hong Kong's strong performance in table tennis over the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu, who also chairs the World Table Tennis (WTT) Board, said the SAR may play host to the WTT finals this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really looking forward to having table tennis competitions at this new sports venue and have been following its development closely. Hong Kong's table tennis development has been excellent with widespread participation. This year's WTT finals may also be held in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liu also expressed confidence that the National Games will lead to major breakthroughs in sports and tourism in the Greater Bay Area.

<img alt="Lucas Bergvall's own goal condemned Spurs to defeat by Dutch side AZ Alkmaar." src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794649_2_20250307055618.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United drew 1-1 away to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie, while Tottenham suffered a 1-0 loss away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.
 <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee drilled in from just outside the area to give United the lead on 57 minutes in San Sebastian, but Mikel Oyarzabal levelled from the spot after Bruno Fernandes was punished for a handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zirkzee cut a distraught figure after missing the decisive penalty in last week's FA Cup shootout loss to Fulham and has endured a testing first season at United, whose only remaining hope of silverware is in the Europa League.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored for the first time in Europe this term, unleashing a sharp low drive from 20 yards after being teed up by Alejandro Garnacho's inviting pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ruben Amorim's side could not hold on to their advantage as Fernandes handled at a corner, with Oyarzabal confidently converting his spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andre Onana made two excellent saves to keep United level as Real Sociedad pressed for a winner, leaving the tie evenly poised ahead of next week's second leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt until the penalty we had control of the game and then I think the penalty changed a little bit the momentum," Amorim said. "I felt our team in the last 30 minutes were really, really tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We take this stage to Old Trafford, and it's going to be a different game," he added. "The pressure is going to be on us in that stadium and we have to be ready."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Bergvall's first-half own goal condemned Spurs to defeat in the Netherlands, and it could have been worse for Ange Postecoglou's side were it not for two fine saves from Guglielmo Vicario.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Rangers recorded an impressive 3-1 win away to a Fenerbahce team coached by Jose Mourinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cyriel Dessers put Rangers ahead early on in Istanbul before Alexander Djiku hauled Fenerbahce level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vaclav Cerny restored the lead for the Scots before striking again nine minutes from time to place Rangers in firm control under interim boss Barry Ferguson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon also took a big stride towards the quarter-finals with a 3-1 victory at Romanians FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Fonseca fought back tears as his players celebrated Nicolas Tagliafico's opener with him, a day after the Portuguese coach was banned from the dugout until November by French football officials after an angry altercation with a referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Fofana won the game for Lyon with two late goals after Alexandru Baluta had equalised for FCSB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma host Athletic Bilbao later on Thursday, while Ajax are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Lazio travel to Viktoria Plzen for the first leg of their tie. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Irish captain Caelan Doris is fit and will face France, handing a massive boost to Ireland ahead of their potential Six Nations title decider in Dublin on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old No 8, who missed the win over Wales last month owing to a knee injury, will win his 50th cap and is one of four changes to the starting XV from the Welsh match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fullback Hugo Keenan returns, as does prop Finlay Bealham, who was a replacement against the Welsh, and Bundee Aki comes in to partner Robbie Henshaw in the centres for the suspended Garry Ringrose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Caelan has done incredibly well to get back to full fitness," Ireland's interim head coach Simon Easterby told reporters on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It says a lot about him that he has done as many other players might not have been able to do that in such a short space of time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Osborne, who stood in for Keenan against Wales, moves to the wing as Mack Hansen has a thigh injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Easterby said Osborne's versatility earned him the nod ahead of an out-and-out winger such as Calvin Nash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We felt it was right to give him (Osborne) the right wing as it gives us coverage across the backs due to his versatility," said Easterby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mack (Hansen) was touch and go, but he was comfortable with the call."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sam Prendergast and Jamison Gibson-Park, who have been outstanding thus far, will form the half-back partnership.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Conan, who started the Wales game instead of the injured Doris, has also recovered from a lower back problem and will be on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Bealham and Doris, Conan is set for his 50th Test appearance. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior Guangdong official on Thursday said the province will work closely with Hong Kong and Macau to host the National Games this year, and strengthen technological cooperation to build a world-class Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Hu, the executive vice-governor of Guangdong, made the remark at a plenary session of Guangdong deputies to the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a first, the National Games will be hosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macau this November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the same meeting, Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong expressed his vision to welcome people from all walks of life for the quadrennial gala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope to invite everyone to come and watch the Games in Guangdong and the Greater Bay Area ... to experience the rapid changes of Guangdong and the unique charm of the vibrant Greater Bay Area," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong party secretary Huang Kunming, meanwhile, described the province's proximity to Hong Kong and Macau as a natural and unique advantage, adding the two SARs connect the region to the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang thanked both cities for their support and investment in Guangdong, saying their involvement is key to the Greater Bay Area's development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 26 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers punched their ticket to the NBA playoffs with a hard-fought 112-107 victory over the Miami Heat.
 <br>
  <br>
  A see-saw battle in Cleveland saw the Heat threaten to end the Cavs' 11-game unbeaten streak after opening up a seven-point lead late in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Cavs clawed back the deficit in the closing minutes to seal their 12th straight victory and a place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers improved to 52-10, maintaining their stranglehold on the Eastern Conference with 20 games of the regular season remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell was one of six Cleveland players to finish in double figures against a short-handed Miami team missing Andrew Wiggins, Kel'el Ware and Jaime Jaquez Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley backed Mitchell with 16 points and 13 rebounds while Darius Garland finished with 15 points and 10 assists. Bam Adebayo led Miami's scorers with a game-high 34 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory though was too close for comfort for Cleveland talisman Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It took a collective effort as a group but we locked down and got stops – but we've got to be better," Mitchell said. "It's always good to learn through a win though."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell played down the significance of Cleveland becoming the first team to reach the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's definitely a blessing and a sign of our hard work, but it don't really mean much," Mitchell said. "I'm happy we were able to do it for the crowd, but we've got a lot more to accomplish."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's nearest pursuers, the Boston Celtics, powered past the Portland Trail Blazers 128-118 after a sensational pair of 40-point performances from Derrick White and Payton Pritchard.
  <br>
  <br>
  White finished with 41 points while Pritchard erupted for 43 points, delivering a shooting masterclass that included 10 three-pointers from 16 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were tremendous," Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said of White and Pritchard's double-act. "The way those two played says a lot about who they are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They do a lot of the dirty work. So to have a night like this where those two can show what they're capable of was good for us," he added. "We're lucky to have them and it's a lot of fun to watch them do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 44-18 with the win and are eight games behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks kept up their pursuit of the Eastern Conference's front-runners with a 137-107 drubbing of the Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard led the Bucks scoring with 34 points while Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 32 points. The Bucks improved to 36-25 for the season and remain fourth in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte, Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels scored 29 points apiece as the Minnesota Timberwolves pulled away to complete a 125-110 win over the Hornets. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool snatched a late winner to beat Paris Saint-Germain away 1-0 in the first leg of their heavyweight Champions League last-16 tie, as Barcelona claimed a 1-0 win at Benfica despite the Catalan giants playing most of the game with 10 men.
 <br>
  <br>
  French league leaders PSG dominated at the Parc des Princes but couldn't make their superiority count and Harvey Elliott struck three minutes from time after replacing Mohamed Salah with Liverpool's only shot on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half but Arne Slot's side defended resolutely to keep PSG at bay and are in a strong position to advance to the quarter-finals going into next week's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker made several crucial saves, as PSG had 28 attempts on goal but could not replicate the finishing that had allowed them to score 21 goals in their last five Champions League outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably the performance of my life," Alisson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To go away with a win over here was probably a bit more than we deserved," added Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  If Liverpool finish the job at home next Tuesday, they could face Aston Villa in the quarter-finals, but PSG coach Luis Enrique said his side will have "nothing to lose".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to win clearly, we created a lot of chances," said the Spaniard. "Football is unfair many times and you have to accept that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Raphinha drilled home after 61 minutes to give five-time winners Barcelona a slim advantage over Benfica despite playing most of the game with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage defender Pau Cubarsi was sent off midway through the first half of the tight clash in Lisbon with the score goalless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona have not won the competition since 2015 but are expected to go deep this season, after a draw which many consider favourable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick insisted before the game there was no such thing as an "easy" tie and the coach was proven right on a tense evening in the Portuguese capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said to the team that I'm very proud," said the German coach after his team emerged with a victory. "After the 22nd minute with 10 players it was not easy, and this is a big win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny endured two high-profile mistakes against Benfica in the group stage in January, but made amends with a string of saves as Barca were pinned back in the final half hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szczesny made a smart save to deny Benfica's Kerem Akturkoglu after just a few seconds, and the opening stages were played in a way that indicated both sides were picking up where they left off in Barcelona's wild 5-4 win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dani Olmo fired narrowly wide at the other end as Barca threatened, before Benfica goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin produced a stunning triple save to keep the score level.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian first parried Dani Olmo's prodded effort, then made a brilliant reaction stop to thwart Robert Lewandowski converting from point-blank range and mopped up Lamine Yamal's attempt from the rebound. (AFP)

<img alt="New Zealand's Rachin Ravindra, left, celebrates with teammate Kane Williamson after scoring a century. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794471_1_20250306053652.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson struck hundreds as New Zealand eased to a 50-run win over South Africa in Lahore to set up a rematch with India in the Champions Trophy final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra made 108 off 101 balls and Williamson hit 102 off 94 deliveries, as New Zealand posted a Champions Trophy record 362-6 before restricting South Africa to 312-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Miller finished unbeaten on 100 but his 67-ball blitz came in vain with the game already well out of reach, as South Africa suffered their fifth Champions Trophy semi-final defeat after those in 2000, 2002, 2006 and 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won the first edition of the tournament in Bangladesh in 1998, when it was named the ICC KnockOut Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner excelled with the ball and took 3-43 with his left-arm spin, breaking a 105-run partnership for South Africa's second wicket by removing rival skipper Temba Bavuma for 56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma started slowly but steadied the innings with Rassie van der Dussen, who scored a fluent 69 before being deceived by a beautiful delivery from Santner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Santner then dealt a critical blow when he dismissed Heinrich Klaasen for three, caught by a diving Matt Henry at long-on, dashing South Africa's hopes of pulling off the highest chase in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra had Aiden Markram caught and bowled for 31 while Glenn Phillips chipped in with 2-27 as South Africa crumbled against spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a cool feeling to make the final," said Santner. "We were challenged by a good side and now we've had a go against India, look forward to do it again."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand last won an ICC ODI men's event in 2000, beating India in the final of that year's Champions Trophy in Kenya. India won by 44 runs when the teams met in the group phase last Sunday in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bavuma said New Zealand were simply too good for South Africa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "New Zealand were above par," said Bavuma. "We backed ourselves to chase 350 with the wicket getting better but they really put us under pressure from the get-go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra and Williamson set the foundations for a big total on a batting-friendly Gaddafi Stadium pitch after New Zealand won the toss and batted first.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daryl Mitchell clubbed 49 off 37 balls and Phillips smashed a 27-ball 49 not out as the Black Caps plundered 110 runs in the last 10 overs and 66 in the last five.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa's bowling line-up struggled right from the start as Ravindra and Will Young (21) put on 48 for the opening stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was followed by a magnificent 164-run partnership for the second wicket between Ravindra and Williamson that put the New Zealanders on track for a massive total, as the duo scored at will with some delightful strokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ravindra completed his fifth ODI hundred – all coming in ICC events – from 93 balls with a two off Kagiso Rabada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson reached his 15th ODI hundred with a ramped boundary, his third three-figure score in as many matches against South Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Rabada who finally ended the partnership by dismissing Ravindra caught behind. Ravindra hit 13 fours and one six in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson chipped Wiaan Mulder into the hands of Lungi Ngidi in the 40th over after hitting 10 fours and two sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell and Phillips added some late impetus after South Africa had briefly dragged things back to give themselves hope of limiting the score to under 350.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fast bowler Ngidi finished with 3-72, while Rabada ended with figures of 2-70. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James became the first player in NBA history to score 50,000 career points on Tuesday, extending his lead as the league's all-time record scorer by reaching a milestone tally that may never be surpassed.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Lakers superstar went into the game against the New Orleans Pelicans with 49,999 regular and postseason points after a 17-point performance in Sunday's win over the Los Angeles Clippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did not take long for the 40-year-old NBA icon to get the solitary point needed to reach the 50,000-point barrier.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who is in dazzling form in the 22nd season of a glittering career, gathered a pass from Luka Doncic and unfurled a sublime 25-foot three-pointer to move to 50,002 points with the Crypto.com Arena crowd roaring their acclaim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James had passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's previous all-time regular-season scoring record of 38,387 points in 2023 – itself a record that had stood for 39 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  James is now nearly 6,000 points clear of Abdul-Jabbar's total career points tally of 44,149, with Karl Malone third (41,689 points) and the late Kobe Bryant fourth with 39,283 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Jordan is fifth on the all-time scoring list with 38,279.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among active NBA players, only Kevin Durant, with just over 35,000 points – roughly 15,000 points behind James – makes the top 10. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Andy Kwok, the captain of the Hong Kong Golf Club, on Wednesday said he expects a lot more spectators at the second edition of LIV Golf Hong Kong event in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will be the third event of the League's 2025 season, taking place from March 7 to 9 at the Hong Kong Golf Club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he is looking forward to seeing people from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's great that we're now bringing mega sporting event organisers coming to Hong Kong to host mega sports events. I think it's great for Hong Kong, great for our people, great for the economy and as the club, being a golf club, obviously we want to bring the best golf events of the world to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were quite successful in hosting the first edition of the LIV Golf Hong Kong last year, and we're looking forward to an even more successful LIV Golf Hong Kong event this year, and hopefully we will try our best to continue to bring world-class events, and hopefully LIV can come back continuously in the future. We will try very hard to facilitate that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott O'Neil, CEO of LIV Golf, said the tour plans to have a major presence in all the markets that matter in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of Asia, it's no secret golf is booming here. I believe we're up about 30 percent year over year in terms of participants playing golf, and it's no surprise that this is a place where we feel like home," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll obviously be in Hong Kong and Singapore and Korea, and those are three markets that we're very passionate about."

 Fans at Kai Tak for the World Snooker Grand Prix will now be allowed to stay until the last game is finished, the government says, after spectators were ejected from the venue while a match was still underway on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  About 100 people were watching Kyren Wilson play Matthew Selt in Kai Tak Arena when at around 11.15pm, with the match going into the fifth frame, the crowd were told to leave.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Secretary Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that organisers were worried about the availability of public transport if the spectators stayed any longer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This situation is obviously not ideal, and we definitely need to take into account the experience seriously and identify remedial measures," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law described the saga as "teething problems" and said it won't happen again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting from tonight, all spectators will be allowed to view the entire series of matches until the last game is done. So, there will be no more question of spectators having to leave before the game ends," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said those affected can get complimentary tickets for another session of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some spectators were required to leave early before the match concluded and were unable to watch the full game. The tournament organising committee sincerely apologises for this situation," a statement said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid claimed a small edge on city rivals Atlético Madrid with a tight 2-1 Champions League last 16 first-leg win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julián Alvarez levelled for Atlético after Rodrygo Goes sent the hosts ahead, but Brahim Díaz stroked home the winner for the record 15-time winners to delight the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's Atlético, who lost in the 2014 and 2016 finals against their bitter rivals, kept stars Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappé quiet but still came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rojiblancos played it safe in the final stages, seeming to accept their one-goal disadvantage for the second leg derby clash at home next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti opted for Morocco international Díaz in midfield to replace the suspended Jude Bellingham and selected Fede Valverde at right-back after he was passed fit to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian had demanded his side show a better attitude and more commitment than during their La Liga defeat by Real Betis on Saturday and his charges delivered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo pounced after just four minutes, slipping inside Javi Galán to collect Valverde's teasing pass before firing home with his left foot across Jan Oblak and inside the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For a moment we had the game under control, but we knew that it would not be an easy match, because they were at home and they have great players," Alvarez said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we know there are 90 minutes to go," he added. "It's one goal, and another game, at home with our fans."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian winger's fifth strike of the tournament, habitually shining on the European stage for Madrid, where he boasts 25 goals in 61 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo wanted a penalty when Galán appeared to hold him back in the area but his appeals were waved away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético host Real Madrid next week at the Metropolitano stadium, with the winner facing Arsenal or PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal all but ensured a quarter-final berth as they crushed a shambolic PSV 7-1 in Eindhoven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jurrien Timber headed Arsenal into the lead on 18 minutes before Ethan Nwaneri smashed a second. Mikel Merino, from a narrow angle, put the visitors three goals up in just the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noa Lang hit back with a PSV penalty before half-time. But Martin Odegaard slotted home a rebound and Leandro Trossard dinked a goal as Arsenal scored twice in the first three minutes of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard added another with 12 minutes left and then set up defender Riccardo Calafiori, a first-half replacement, to round off the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were fluid. We had enthusiasm, the drive and the hunger," Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice said. "We need to keep pushing as a team with the mentality." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dallas Mavericks All Star guard Kyrie Irving will miss the rest of the NBA season after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee, according to media reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Irving sustained the injury during Monday's loss to the Sacramento Kings and the news is a massive blow to a Mavericks team already grappling with a turbulent season following the trade of star Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving, 32, hyperextended his knee, falling while he drove to the basket and was carried off court.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic cited sources saying the injury had been confirmed as a season-ending ACL.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Irving left the court, Jaden Hardy then turned his ankle in the third quarter and had to leave the game, adding to a growing injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, beaten by the Boston Celtics in last year's NBA finals, has been reeling since trading superstar Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in early February for Anthony Davis, a blockbuster move aimed at retooling the roster around Irving and Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Davis has been sidelined with an adductor strain, while P.J Washington, Dereck Lively, Daniel Gifford and Caleb Martin are all on the injury list.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavericks have lost four of their last five games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just seems every time we get close to get someone back, someone else goes down, we are running out of bodies here," said Mavs head coach Jason Kidd after Monday's loss. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Virat Kohli produced a trademark innings with a polished 84 as India pulled off a tense chase to beat Australia by four wickets in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Set 265 for victory, India lost the 36-year-old Kohli in the closing overs but KL Rahul's unbeaten 42 steered the team home with 11 balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will face South Africa or New Zealand in the final on Sunday in Dubai, with India playing all their matches at the venue after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan for the eight-nation event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lahore was the alternative venue for the final had India missed out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game is all about pressure, especially in big games like semis and finals," said player of the match Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you go deep into the innings and have wickets in hand, the opposition usually gives in and the game becomes easier. It is very important to control your impulses while the game is going on."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia elected to bat and posted 264 all out after strong knocks from captain Steve Smith, who made 73, and Alex Carey, who hit 61.
  <br>
  <br>
  In reply India lost two early wickets before Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, who made 45, put the chase back on track in their partnership of 91.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take pride in doing what my team wants," added the 36-year-old Kohli. "Individual records don't matter anymore for me. It's just about stepping out and hopefully doing the job for the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's arguably the best chaser the game has seen. He's done it numerous times against us," Smith said of Kohli. "He controls the tempo of the game really well, plays to his strengths and takes the game deep."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cooper Connolly, in the team in place of the injured Matthew Short who was forced out of the tournament on Monday, trapped skipper Rohit Sharma lbw on 28 for his first ODI wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli and Iyer then took stock against an inexperienced Australian attack missing fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood to injuries and Mitchell Starc for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  But leg-spinner Adam Zampa bowled Iyer before Nathan Ellis rattled the stumps of Axar Patel for 27. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Judd Trump made a winning start in Hong Kong, beating Gary Wilson to advance to the last 16 of the World Snooker Grand Prix at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who recently obtained Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was playing on home soil for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was fellow Englishman Wilson who started off strong and took the first frame. Trump struck back with a 142 break to level things up, before going on to win the best-of-seven match 4-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old will next face another Englishman Jack Lisowski.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other first-round action, English stars Shaun Murphy and David Gilbert both secured narrow 4-3 victories to reach the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Rosanna Law, was in attendance and officiated at the opening ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  She hoped the ranking tournament will be a huge success and hoped that players and visitors would have an unforgettable experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  This six-day event marks the first official sports competition at the Kai Tak Sports Park, with over 4,200 people attending on the first day.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest needed penalties to beat Ipswich and book a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals after a 1-1 draw at the City Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor was the only man who failed to score from the spot as Matz Sels' save edged the shootout 5-4 in Forest's favour to set up a last eight trip to Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sides are separated by 15 places and 31 points in the Premier League, but with Forest's priority securing Champions League football next season, Nuno Espírito Santo rested a number of his key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich sensed their opportunity and took the lead early in the second half when George Hirst headed in a corner at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Yates took advantage of some woeful defending to nod in an equaliser 22 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 30 minutes of extra-time came and went without a winner despite Nuno sending on top scorer Chris Wood and England international Morgan Gibbs-White.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sels, another of Forest's star performers this season, proved the hero after the first nine penalties of the shootout found the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In penalties one of the goalkeepers is going to be the hero," said Sels. "I'm happy I could help the team to the next round. It was the only penalty I was in the right corner." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers erased an 18-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers 133-129 in an NBA overtime thriller, boosting their league-best record with a 10th straight victory as Boston beat Denver in a clash of the past two champions.
 <br>
  <br>
  De'Andre Hunter, getting a starting nod as Cavs star Donovan Mitchell rested, scored 18 of his game-high 32 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as Cleveland poured it on late to grab their 50th win of the season against 10 defeats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made open shots, tried to get to the rim and get fouled," Hunter said of his late-game heroics, which saw him give Cleveland the lead for good with a three-pointer that put them up 131-129 with 30.8 seconds remaining in overtime
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter, acquired from Atlanta at the trade deadline, then came up with a steal and grabbed a rebound when Portland's Deni Avdija missed a three-pointer. Finally Hunter drilled a pair of free-throws to seal the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ty Jerome scored 25 points off the bench for Cleveland as six Cavs players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Avdija led Portland with 30 points and added 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his first career triple-double. Anfernee Simons scored 27 points for the Blazers, who led most of the first half in pursuit of a fifth straight win.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cleveland edged ahead 42-39 on Darius Garland's jump shot, Portland closed the first half on a 15-0 scoring run that sent them into the locker room leading 54-42.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs pulled level at 101-101 with just under five minutes left in the fourth quarter, and they traded the lead three more times before Simons made a pair of free-throws that tied it at 119-119 to send it to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're a resilient group," said Jerome, admitting the Cavs' come-from-behind win over the Celtics in Boston on Friday had taken it out of them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And that's a good team," he added of the Blazers. "We just had to stay with it and make some shots."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Boston, the Celtics let a big lead get away before holding off the Nuggets 110-103.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaylen Brown scored 22 points and handed out eight assists to leading the reigning champion Celtics, who led by as many as 20 points in the third quarter only for Denver to pull within three points in the waning minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray scored 13 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter to key the comeback, his driving layup off a rebound of a Brown miss pulling the Nuggets within 102-99 with 1:15 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBA Most valuable Player Nikola Jokic scored 20 points with 14 rebounds and nine assists for the 2023 champion Nuggets, but the Celtics came up with the shots when they needed them to snap a two-game skid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran Al Horford finished with 19 points, Derrick White added 17 and Jayson Tatum had a relatively modest 16 with 11 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Defensively, I thought we were good tonight," Brown said. "Offensively we missed some good looks.I missed some layups, I missed some open shots, but we were able to hang on." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United's dismal season hit a new low as the FA Cup holders crashed out after a 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat against Fulham in the fifth round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's side trailed to Calvin Bassey's first-half opener at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised to force a 1-1 draw after extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham keeper Bernd Leno was the hero in the shoot-out as he saved from Victor Lindelof and Joshua Zirkzee, with the visitors converting all four of their kicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Booed off at half-time, it was another wretched result for United in a season that sees them languishing in 14th place in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13-time FA Cup winners had reached the final for the last two seasons and beat Manchester City to lift the trophy last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there will be no trip to Wembley this season for United, who have only the Europa League left as a silverware chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard. We had the best chances in the game but in the end the penalties can go both ways and today it was not our day," Amorim said. "I know that we are losing games and losing trophies during this season but the goal is to win the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how long it's going to take," he added. "But if you think like that, we can suffer a little bit in these defeats."
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been another testing week at Old Trafford, with 200 job cuts announced and United struggling to draw with Everton and barely beat lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim admitted that life is "hard" just now for United and this was the latest hammer blow to the under-fire Portuguese coach, who only arrived in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head to Real Sociedad for the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday before hosting Arsenal in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Amorim to realise United were in for another dispiriting afternoon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund fired over from an acute angle after Christian Eriksen's cross found the much-maligned United striker, whose goalless drought has now reached 18 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eriksen's curler was fisted away by Leno, but that did little to satisfy fans frustrated by years of underachievement. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethiopia dominated the competition at the Tokyo Marathon on Sunday, winning both the men's and women's categories.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tadese Takele won the men's race in a time of 2 hours, 3 minutes, 23 seconds on Sunday as Uganda's double Olympic track champion Joshua Cheptegei finished ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele broke clear of the pack with around four kilometres to go in warm conditions to claim his first major marathon title, shaving a second off his previous personal best.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takele's compatriot Deresa Geleta was second in 2:03:51, with Kenya's Vincent Kipkemoi Ngetich third in 2:04:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The weather wasn't a problem, it wasn't too hot and for me it was comfortable," said Takele.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The course was good and this was a great day for me. In the future, I hope to run even better than I did today."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's race, Ethiopia's Sutume Asefa Kebede defended her title, finishing in 2 hours, 16 minutes, 31 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya's Winfridah Moraa Moseti was second in 2:16:56, with Ethiopia's Hawi Feysa third in 2:17:00.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheptegei, who won gold in both the Tokyo Olympics 5,000m in 2021 and the 10,000m in Paris last year, was running his second marathon after making his debut at the distance in Valencia two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old finished in a time of 2:05:59.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, who was running her first marathon in 10 years at the age of 51, finished in a time of 2:57:26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Radcliffe also plans to run the Boston Marathon next month. (AFP)

    Man City beat giant killers Plymouth in FA Cup

<img alt="Manchester City's English midfielder Nico O'Reilly celebrates scoring the team's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793851_1_20250302075410.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City survived a scare to beat giant killers Plymouth 3-1 and progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, after Crystal Palace striker Jean Philippe-Mateta was hospitalised in the Eagles' 3-1 win over Millwall.
 <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had shocked Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round and were on course for another stunning upset at the Etihad when Maksym Talovierov headed them in front on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argyle boss Miron Muslic said it would be the "biggest honour" of his life to go head-to-head with Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  With FA Cup glory City's only realistic hope of silverware this season, Guardiola surprisingly rotated his side with Erling Haaland among those left on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was one of City's youngsters who took his chance to shine as Nico O'Reilly turned the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslic will be furious at the manner of both the 19-year-old's goals as he twice headed in from set-pieces under little pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Reilly's equaliser just before half-time calmed City's nerves before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that point Guardiola had summoned Haaland off the bench and he teed up the third for Kevin De Bruyne in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Big compliments to Plymouth for making our job so difficult. They were incredibly organised, but we played a good game," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace's progress into the last eight came at a cost as Mateta was stretchered off the field straight into an ambulance and taken to hospital in the early stages of their south London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was sent off just eight minutes in after catching Mateta's head with his boot as he raced out of the penalty area to clear the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referee Michael Oliver only issued a red card after a VAR review of the challenge, with Roberts winning the ball before accidently crashing his boot into Mateta's head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever. Well done guys for a great job today," Mateta posted on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace later said he had been discharged from hospital after receiving 25 stitches "to a severe laceration to his left ear".
  <br>
  <br>
  Manager Oliver Glasner said the incident could have ended the Frenchman's career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career," said Glasner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace chairman Steve Parish described as the "most reckless challenge" he had ever seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side made use of the man advantage to book their place in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japhet Tanganga's own goal put Palace ahead in the 33rd minute before Daniel Munoz prodded in the second seven minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth advanced to the last eight for only the third time in their history with a 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Wolves after their 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson's 30th-minute opener for Bournemouth was followed by VAR controversy as Milos Kerkez had a second ruled out for offside after an eight-minute check when the new semi-automated version of the system broke down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha levelled for Wolves with a second-half rocket to force extra-time, but the Brazilian was sent off for violent conduct after repeatedly clashing with Kerkez just before the penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Matt Doherty missed when he had the chance to send Wolves through, Boubacar Traore hit the crossbar and Luis Sinisterra sealed the win for Andoni Iraola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milutin Osmajic taunted Burnley fans after helping Preston into the quarter-finals for the first time since 1966 with a 3-0 win at Deepdale.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the Championship sides played in the league two weeks ago, Burnley midfielder Hannibal Mejbri accused Osmajic of racist abuse, allegations which the Preston striker denies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burnley players declined to shake hands with Montenegro international Osmajic before their latest meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osmajic got Preston's second goal late in the first half and celebrated by taunting Burnley fans with his hands cupped around his ears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robbie Brady and Will Keane were also on target as Preston ended Burnley's 23-game unbeaten run. (AFP)

 Ronnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 scheduled at Kai Tak Arena next week, citing health reasons.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I am very disappointed not to be competing. I had been eager to make my comeback in Hong Kong and have put in my utmost effort, but unfortunately must consider my health. I wish to sincerely thank the organisers and all the Hong Kong fans for their support," the 49-year-old star said in a statement on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rocket, as he's nicknamed, will be replaced by world number 33 Hossein Vafaei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event will be the first ranking tournament in the SAR since 1989.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Judd Trump, who -- like O'Sullivan -- became a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, will now headline the competition from March 4 to 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other big names include Mark Williams, Mark Selby and Ding Junhui.

<img alt="Aryna Sabalenka at the Qatar Open 2025 WTA 1000 tennis tournament in February. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793781_1_20250301123815.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka praised on Friday the WTA's mission to highlight the personalities of its athletes and called Saudi Arabia's investment in the women's tennis tour an important part of growing the game.
 <br>
  <br>
  The WTA rebranding, complete with a new logo and "Rally the world" tagline, comes amid a rise in global viewership and a record US$4.8 million prize awarded last year to Coco Gauff for winning the WTA Finals in Riyadh, a tournament sponsored by Saudi's Public Investment Fund (PIF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot. We needed this refreshing moment for so long," Sabalenka told Reuters at a WTA-hosted cocktail party in Hollywood celebrating the tour's new look and mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big move and I hope it's going to help our sport to get better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, a big-serving Belarusian who grew up admiring the power games of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, said giving fans a more intimate look at the stars of the tour would pay off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The WTA should show our personalities and what it takes to become a top athlete," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have to be an inspiration for the younger generation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Announced in May, the multi-year partnership with PIF marked the latest move in a dramatic shift by the women's tour, which was previously reluctant to embrace Saudi partnership amid criticisms of the Gulf nation's human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been there a lot and they have passion for sport. Their help means a lot for us," Sabalenka said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support is very important for the WTA. I think all of us will be very grateful for their support."
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's ATP Tour also signed a multi-year "strategic partnership" last year with PIF, which has pumped huge amounts of money into soccer, Formula One and the LIV Golf circuit. (Reuters)

    Jos Buttler quits as England's white-ball captain

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jos Buttler resigned as England white-ball captain on Friday after his team made an early exit from the Champions Trophy with back-to-back defeats against Australia and Afghanistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  “It’s the right decision for me and the right decision for the team," Buttler said. "Hopefully somebody else who can come in alongside Baz (coach Brendon McCullum) will take the team to where it needs to be.”
  <br>
  <br>
  England lost two high-scoring games in Lahore and conceded the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 against Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler said he would lead England for the final time against South Africa in the last group match at Karachi.
  <br>
  <br>
  England had a disastrous preparation for the Champions Trophy when it won only one of its eight white-ball matches against India before arriving in Pakistan.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The overriding emotions are still sadness and disappointment,” Buttler said while expressing his willingness to continue representing England as a player.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m sure, in time, that (disappointment) will pass and I can get back to really enjoying my cricket, and (will) also be able to reflect on what an immense honour it is to captain your country and all the special things that come with it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Buttler replaced Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball captain in 2022 and only months later won the T20 World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a sharp decline in England’s white-ball cricket with three unimpressive runs at the 2023 World Cup in India, 2024 T20 World Cup in the US and the West Indies and now the Champions Trophy. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Asian Games gold medallist, Stone Shek, on Friday announced his retirement from gymnastics.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shek, 33, said on social media that it's been a difficult yet rewarding journey, saying gymnastics has been his life and he would give his career a full score of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he learned to grow every day, from all the injuries to different low points in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I could choose again, I would choose gymnastics every time," Shek wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Staying committed to something difficult is hard, but it's the mindset that defines success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having taken up gymnastics as a boy, Shek said he has gone through everything after 26 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  He thanked his family, coaches, friends and supporters for "remembering him as the prince of gymnastics".
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek won gold at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon on the vault, and successfully defended the title in Jakarta four years later.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also captured two World Cup gold medals in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shek represented Hong Kong, China at three Olympics: London in 2012, Tokyo in 2021 and Paris last year.

 Hall of Fame coach Gregg Popovich said Thursday he won't return this season as coach of the San Antonio Spurs as he continues to recover from a stroke he suffered in November.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I've decided not to return to the sidelines this season," the 76-year-old coach said in a statement posted on the Spurs X account. "Mitch Johnson and his staff have done a wonderful job and the resolve and professionalism the players have shown, sticking together during a challenging season, has been outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will continue to focus on my health with the hope that I can return to coaching in the future," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that the statement came after Popovich met with Spurs players – their first chance to see him since he suffered what the team has described as a "mild stroke" on November 2 at the team's arena before a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assistant Mitch Johnson was named interim coach, with Popovich saying in December he was working toward a return to the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich, the oldest coach in NBA history, has 1,412 regular-season wins and another 170 post-season triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has guided the Spurs to five NBA titles in his 29 seasons at the helm.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also the USA to basketball gold at the Tokyo Olympics and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of fame in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popovich's stroke is just one of the setbacks for the young Spurs team this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team announced this month that second-year star Victor Wembanyama would miss the rest of the regular-season after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right shoulder. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Leicester sank closer to an immediate return to the Championship after West Ham pulled clear of the bottom three with a convincing 2-0 win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tomas Soucek and a Jannik Vestergaard own goal did for the Foxes before half-time as the Hammers climbed to 15th and 16 points clear of the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Leicester won the reverse fixture in Ruud van Nistelrooy's first game in charge in early December, the Dutchman has overseen 11 defeats and one draw in 13 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goals we concede are easy goals. It's a reflection of how we played in the first half," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were way too passive," he added. "We are in a situation where we are not winning games and we are in a situation where we are in the bottom three. The pressure is on – we cannot wait and sit back."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were buoyant after their shock 1-0 victory at Arsenal on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Graham Potter's men were well worthy of another three points and could have ran out much more comfortable winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a professional performance. Not fantastic, but we are delighted with two wins, two clean sheets and six points," said Potter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soucek had the simple task to tap into an empty net after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen saved Mohammed Kudus' effort from close range on 21 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jarrod Bowen then took advantage of slack Leicester defending from a corner just before half-time and his shot deflected off the unfortunate Vestergaard beyond Hermansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Ferguson wasted the chance to score his first West Ham goal when his shot was blocked by Wout Faes after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the home side had already done enough to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves Leicester still five points adrift of safety in 19th and showing no signs of being able to stop a slide back into the second tier. (AFP)
