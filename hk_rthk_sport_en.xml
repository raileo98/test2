<div class="itemFullText">
 Nine-time PGA tournament winner Patrick Reed on Friday said he will be banking on his decade-long familiarity with the Hong Kong Open, as he gears up to compete in the tournament for the fifth time in his career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The competition will be staged for the 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, and is set to feature a star-studded lineup that already includes Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015, and South Korean phenom Tom Kim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, Reed said he aims to use past experience to his advantage, as he looks to add the Hong Kong Open trophy to a collection that already includes a 2018 Masters Tournament title and two World Golf Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first time I came to Hong Kong, it was absolutely outstanding," said the 33-year-old Texas native, who has been ranked in the world top 50 since 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always planned on coming back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've played here four other times and over time, have gotten to know the golf course which helps provide that comfort factor. The task now is to put my head down, get going and execute."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Reed also said the Hong Kong Open doesn't come easy, and says he hopes to get over the hump this time around.
  <br>
  <br>
  His best result at the competition came in 2015, where he shot a final round 67 to earn a tie for third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a couple areas on that golf course that seem to get me every year," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hopefully this year, I'm able to clean them up this time around – rather than sitting there and marking it down again and again."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A win over the Philippines in an international friendly on Thursday has given the Hong Kong, China team momentum in the bid to qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 3-1 victory in front of a raucous 5,000-strong crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium was the second consecutive win for the SAR under new head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brilliant goal by forward Matt Orr put the home team ahead in the 44th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orr's one-two on the left side of the box with Kitchee striker Juninho opened up a chance for him to score on the left side.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised shortly after the break, with Bjørn Kristensen netting in an acrobatic finish in the 48th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR then scored two late goals to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Man winger Everton Camargo's 83rd-minute strike put Hong Kong up 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old Brazilian was also involved in the third goal, floating in a free kick to Orr who headed home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Hong Kong is another international friendly – against Mauritius on November 19 at the Mong Kok Stadium.

    High security as Israel draw with France in Paris

<img alt="The Israeli team on the pitch after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779241_1_20241115080700.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israel and France played out a goalless draw in a Nations League football match in Paris on Thursday surrounded by a huge security operation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 4,000 police and members of the security forces patrolled inside and outside the Stade de France to prevent a repetition of the attacks on fans of Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A further 1,600 civilian security personnel were also on duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards had to intervene at one point to stop fans of both nations from clashing in the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos taken by spectators and posted on the X social media platform showed fans, some with Israeli flags, running along the rows of seats at the stadium while other supporters whistled and booed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members of the stadium security team moved between the two groups to separate them and the incident was over within minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tension surrounding the fixture caused many fans to stay away with just 16,611 in a stadium that holds up to 80,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 100 Israeli fans attended the match despite calls from Israeli authorities to avoid the fixture. Around 600 members of the Jewish community in France travelled to the stadium in buses with a police escort.
  <br>
  <br>
  French authorities mounted a huge security operation after the government defied calls from some French lawmakers to postpone the match or move it to another city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will not give in to anti-Semitism anywhere, and violence – including in the French Republic – will never prevail, nor will intimidation," President Emmanuel Macron, who attended the game, told BFMTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Macron called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before the game to assure him that French authorities had taken the necessary security measures for the match to pass off smoothly, the president's office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  An elite police unit guarded the Israeli team from the moment they arrived on French soil. Israel coach Ran Ben Simon said the security had been "extraordinary".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to thank the security people for protecting us," he said in a post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incidents in the Netherlands took place with anti-Israeli sentiment and reported anti-Semitic acts across the world soaring as Israel wages wars against Iran-backed Islamist militants in Lebanon and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  The violence in Amsterdam flared after Maccabi fans in the city for a match against Ajax set fire to a Palestinian flag and vandalised a taxi 24 hours earlier, authorities said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the match, Maccabi fans were chased by men on scooters and beaten.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam's mayor Femke Halsema called it a "poisonous cocktail of anti-Semitism and hooliganism".
  <br>
  <br>
  Dutch far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders blamed the violence on "Muslims". (AFP)

    England triumph over Greece despite star absences

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's understudies ignored the controversy over Harry Kane's criticism of the team's absentee stars as they beat Greece 3-0 on Thursday to keep alive their hopes of Uefa Nations League promotion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kane was surprisingly dropped by interim boss Lee Carsley just 24 hours after his scathing response to the rash of withdrawals from England's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England captain said international duty should "come before anything" amid suggestions several had been persuaded by their club managers to pull out to avoid injuries at a busy time of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Levi Colwill, Aaron Ramsdale and even Jarrad Branthwaite, who was a late call-up, all opted to withdraw from Carsley's squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carsley's decision to leave Kane on the bench for the first 66 minutes before introducing him as a substitute was seen in some quarters as a rebuke for his uncharacteristically divisive comments.
  <br>
  <br>
  In truth, Kane may have been given a rest day in the midst of a hectic campaign with Bayern Munich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the stay-away players weren't missed as England's reserves powered to a victory that leaves them in control of their fate in Nations League Group B2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins, deputising for Kane, gave England an early lead in the Olympic Stadium in Athens before an own goal from Greece keeper Odysseas Vlachodimos doubled the visitors' advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like Watkins, Curtis Jones had benefitted from the England absences and the Liverpool midfielder marked his first England start with their third goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have moved above Greece on goal difference and will be guaranteed to win promotion to Nations League A if they beat Ireland at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If England finish second in the group, they go into a promotion play-off against one of the third-placed League A sides next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That will be of particular interest to Thomas Tuchel, the incoming England manager who was notable by his absence in Athens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel agreed an 18-month contract to become the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate in October, but the former Bayern Munich and Chelsea boss is not due to start until January 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  England are treading water until Tuchel takes charge, with questions asked about why the German has not already started his reign ahead of the qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. (AFP)

    Sinner beats Medvedev for perfect ATP Finals group run

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner capped a perfect group stage at the ATP Finals with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev on Thursday which eliminated his Russian rival.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner had already qualified for the semi-finals thanks to Alex De Minaur winning the opening set in his defeat to Taylor Fritz earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  And he only needed a set to ensure top spot in the Ilie Nastase Group and deny Medvedev a place in the last four of the season-ending event in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was in no mood to disappoint his passionate home supporters and put in the latest in an increasingly long line of impressive performances to head into the semis with a perfect three wins from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have a reason to smile, it was a good match and a brilliant atmosphere as always," said a delighted Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a difficult match, Daniil and I know each other really well so I knew that I had to get it right tactically," he added. "Let's see who I have in the semi-finals, I'm happy to get there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev would have progressed with a win in straight sets but the world number four has now won just one of his last nine matches with Sinner and was outclassed in northern Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing the season with no titles, he told reporters that he rated his season "zero out of 10" when looking at "where I put my goals and where I finish".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to be number one in the world, but I didn't play well enough this year, by far," Medvedev said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm number four in the big tennis world," he went on to say. "I'm super proud about that because, as I said, especially in the end of the year, I struggled throughout the whole year. Every practice, every match was a struggle for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner is hunting his first Finals title after an exceptional season in which he won seven tournaments, including his first Grand Slam victories at the Australian and US Opens.
  <br>
  <br>
  He lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of the tournament injured this time around and he entered the 2024 event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An international rugby match will be held on Saturday as part of trial events to test the new Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match from 4pm between Hong Kong and Brazil is the second test event at the 5,000-seat venue, following a local football league game there last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports Commissioner George Tsoi said more than 3,000 spectators are expected to attend the match – double the number at the football game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we will be progressively increasing the intensity as well as the scale of our test events in the different venues within the Kai Tak Sports Park," Tsoi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will increase the number of participants each time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsoi added that authorities will make direction signs larger and install more gates with metal detectors at the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner also said the government plans to hold a trial event for an indoor venue at the park next month, and another in the 50,000-seat main stadium in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, the CEO of Hong Kong China Rugby, said Saturday's match will be more than just a trial run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It also gives us a prime opportunity to build on our collaboration with all the local government stakeholders that we've been working with in recent months," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a Hong Kong China Rugby perspective, we get the opportunity to really utilise the event as a means to learn and test our event operations as we move towards the big event in March."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens will take place at Kai Tak Sports Park from 28-30 March.

    Haughey takes break from swimming to ponder future

<img alt="Siobhan Haughey says she is getting old after taking part in the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in three cities. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778903_1_20241113180939.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey said she will be taking a three- to four-month break from the sport to consider her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" had mentioned before the Paris Olympics of possible retirement, which she said on Wednesday is still on her mind after the recent World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai, Incheon and Singapore during which she won five gold, two silvers and two bronze medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to use this break to think about what my future direction will be. These three stops at the World Cup has made me realise that I am getting old, and that my body recovery is taking more time," the 27-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will be competing at the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest from December 10 to 15 before taking the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she is looking forward to spending the Christmas holiday with her family because she spent previous years taking part in competitions around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said she hopes to use the break to do things that she usually doesn't get to do because of training.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey was speaking to reporters after a ceremony at the South China Athletic Association where the newly completed Water Sports Centre was named after her.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she feels honoured given that she spent a lot of time practising at the association as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added that she participated in the design for the centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this isn't just meaningful to me, but I hope it's meaningful to the community because I'm trying to use what I'm doing to promote swimming and to promote sports," she said.

  "I think it's great that the next generation can be here to witness this, and hopefully they find some sort of inspiration through all of this and think this is meaningful too."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner hit the accelerator at the end of each set as he cruised past Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 on Tuesday to close in on a semi-final spot at the ATP Finals in Turin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In September, Sinner had to overcome raucous home support to win his last meeting with the American as he claimed victory in the final of the US Open, also in straight sets. This time, the Turin crowd was nosily behind the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The crowd is helping me a lot," said Sinner on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard-hitting Fritz, ranked number five, put pressure on Sinner's serve early in the first set. The American had the first break point of the match in the 14-minute seventh game, but could not take his chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner responded at once, but wasted three break points in the next game before breaking to 15 in the 10th game to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling to return his serve but I am happy with how I handled the situation," said Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set also went with serve until the 10th game when Fritz double-faulted on Sinner's first match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very tough match," said Sinner. "We got to know each other very well in a Grand Slam final, we knew exactly what to expect today it was very aggressive as I was prepared for."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory put Sinner top of the Ilie Nastase group with just Daniil Medvedev to face. The home favourite could still be eliminated with a straight-sets loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fritz faces Alex de Minaur who has lost both his matches so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the afternoon match, former champion Medvedev brushed aside Finals debutant De Minaur 6-2, 6-4 to bounce back from an opening defeat and boost his hopes of making the knock-out phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, who lost his first group-stage match to Fritz, overpowered De Minaur to push his Australian opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who lifted the title in 2020, did not face a single break point and broke De Minaur's serve three times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth seed will next face Sinner on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I decided not to care about it in a good way," Medvedev said. "If I lose, the season is over, if I win I have another chance on Thursday – I'll try and do the same the next match, so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players battled to holds in their opening service games, but Medvedev broke for a 2-1 lead and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck 16 winners in the first set and then lost just two points behind his serve in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  A break in the ninth game of the second set proved decisive and he closed out victory with another comfortable hold. (AFP)

    Wittich replaced as F1 race director in surprise move

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula 1's race director Niels Wittich has left his role with immediate effect, the FIA said on Tuesday, in a surprise move.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German, who replaced Michael Masi in 2022, will be replaced for the Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 23 by Rui Marques, who was recently the race director for Formula 2 and 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FIA can confirm that Niels Wittich has stepped down from his position as F1 Race Director to pursue new opportunities," the FIA said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is extremely rare for an F1 race director to be changed mid-season, but the FIA did not elaborate on the reasons for his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masi was removed as Formula One race director after his controversial management of the season-ending 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Max Verstappen pipped Lewis Hamilton to the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not clear if Wittich is the latest victim of a disagreement with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of staff in senior FIA roles have resigned this year. (AFP)

    Barca, Man City victorious in Women's Champions League

<img alt="Barcelona players celebrate scoring their second goal against St. Poelten. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778786_1_20241113082111.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A five-goal blitz in the space of 12 minutes sent Barcelona on their way to a 7-0 romp over St. Poelten in the Uefa Women's Champions League on Tuesday, while Manchester City stayed top of Group D with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal beat Juventus 4-0 in Italy but remain second in Group C after Bayern Munich extended their 100 percent record with a 3-0 victory over Valerenga.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Barcelona, Ewa Pajor, Francisca Nazareth, Aitana Bonmati, Keira Walsh and Claudia Pina all scored between the 32nd and 45th minutes, before Pina and Caroline Graham Hansen added goals in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite scoring 16 goals and conceding none in their last two European outings, holders Barca sit second in Group D after they lost their opening fixture at Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Objective met – yes, absolutely," Barca coach Pere Romeu said after his side's second emphatic victory in three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even when we couldn't score in the first half an hour, we were getting in behind them. And I knew once we got the first goal, more would follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's St Poelten stay bottom of the group with three losses from three.
  <br>
  <br>
  The floodgates opened at the Johan Cruyff Stadium shortly after the half-hour when Pajor slid onto full-back Ona Batlle's cross at the near post and directed the ball into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stand-in captain Marta Torrejon nearly doubled the score soon after she rose highest from a set-piece, but her looping header clipped the top of the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from picking up her second Ballon d'Or last month, Aitana Bonmati nearly caught Carina Schlueter out with a chip but the goalkeeper just managed to claw out the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were all over the Austrians. When Bonmati got in behind the defence on the right, her cross was parried to Nazareth who made no mistake on 38 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmati opened her account in the Champions League this season two minutes later, before Walsh fizzed home a side-footed strike from outside the box in the 42nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the stroke of half-time, Pina flitted in at the back post to guide home an outside-of-the-foot volley as Barca ran riot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish forward then completed her brace from 12 yards seven minutes after the interval following a foul on the rampaging Batlle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Graham added a seventh in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Man City stayed three points ahead of Barca after second-half goals by Laura Brown and Aoba Fujino overcame Sweden's Hammarby 2-0. (AFP)

    FA launches investigation into referee Coote

<img alt="Referee David Coote during the Premier League football match between Liverpool and Brighton. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778784_1_20241113081326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Football Association is investigating after a video was posted on social media appearing to show Premier League referee David Coote making derogatory comments about Liverpool and their former manager Jurgen Klopp.
 <br>
  <br>
  Referees body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd announced on Monday that Coote, 42, had been suspended pending a full investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Football Association is also looking at Coote's comments. It is understood part of its investigation will centre on whether Coote's reference to Klopp's nationality constitutes an aggravated breach of its misconduct rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware of the matter, and we are investigating it," an FA spokesman said on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the clip, Coote, who refereed Liverpool's 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday, said Klopp was "arrogant" and used offensive language.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retired referee Mike Dean, now a TV pundit, believes the incident will have a damaging effect on officials throughout English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As referees you can't put yourself in that position no matter what you do," the 56-year-old said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can say things away from camera, you can talk amongst your friends and things and colleagues," he added. "But you can't let somebody video this and then hope that it's never going to come out."
  <br>
  <br>
  The video appears to refer to a match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1. Liverpool had already been crowned champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp criticised Coote after the match, saying the referee had been too lenient in his treatment of Burnley challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp left Liverpool at the end of last season after nearly nine years in charge at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was also critical of Coote over an incident in a match against Arsenal last season in which Gunners midfielder Martin Odegaard's hand made contact with the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote, as VAR, did not advise on-field official Chris Kavanagh to review the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coote was also the VAR in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in October 2020 when Toffees goalkeeper Jordan Pickford inflicted a season-ending injury on Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pickford was not sent off for the challenge and did not face retrospective action because, under FA rules, that can only happen if an incident was not seen either at the time or when it was reviewed by VAR. (AFP)

<img alt="The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance sports medicine in Hong Kong. Photo courtesy of the Hong Kong Sports Institute" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778718_2_20241112183046.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI) and the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Tuesday to promote sports medicine and sports science, in the hope of enhancing better support systems for elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br>
  HKAM president Gilberto Leung said the Medical Council doesn't recognise sports medicine as a specialisation, so the SAR needs to catch up through developing training programmes in this area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine has a very good track record and we have rich experience in designing training for specialists, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Institute has a lot of experience with actually dealing with patients or athletes with injuries and how to handle their psychology, their nutritional needs, and also injury prevention," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to put the two together, our statutory status, in providing training for doctors and also the experience that the Sports Institute has, and hopefully with that, we can design some really effective and impactful programmes, and on top of that, we would like to explore how to do research because if you have good research, you can improve service and the care to the athletes as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  HKSI chairman Tang King-shing said the future cooperation between the two bodies will focus on providing medical training programmes, organising seminars and workshops to better understand sports medicine trends and technology advancements, and strengthening professional exchanges and experience sharing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and the SAR's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey were among athletes attending the signing event to share the importance of sports medicine for elite athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I go to [the Sports Medicine Centre at HKSI] for physiotherapy pretty frequently because having fenced for so long, it's no surprise that many athletes have injuries. Even if we don't have injuries, preventative care is important for protecting our bodies, so that we can perform our best at the highest level," Cheung said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I see my nutritionist every week and we draw blood to collect my body's data, like white and red blood cell count, iron content and other data. Based on that information, we can see whether my body is healthy and in a normal state," Haughey said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If some numbers are not within the normal range or are out of range, my nutritionist will then suggest what I should eat so that I can supplement the missing nutrients."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell scored 36 points as the unbeaten Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind once more to preserve their 100 percent start to the season with a 119-113 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, who overcame a 14-point deficit to beat Brooklyn on Saturday, were again forced to dig deep, battling back from nine points down in the third quarter for a road victory that takes them to 12-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led another fine all-round offensive performance from Cleveland, who have emerged as the surprise package of the season and are the only undefeated team in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six Cleveland players finished in double figures, with point guard Darius Garland adding 17 points and Evan Mobley 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  Caris LeVert, Georges Niang and Ty Jerome all had 12 points each off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago meanwhile were left ruing their inability to take full advantage after pulling into an 85-76 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead, Cleveland came roaring back with a 9-0 run to tie the game and then pulled ahead to lead by three points heading into the fourth quarter, before closing out victory by outscoring Chicago 24-21 in the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zach LaVine led Chicago's scorers with 26 points, while Coby White and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points apiece. The Bulls fell to 4-7 with the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We dug deep," Mitchell said after the win. "Honestly, the bench saved us. Starters were a little fatigued, and I guess teams are coming at us. But we persevered, and shoutout to the bench for that – it's a group effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us to continue to be what we want to be, that's what it's going to take," he added. "It was a complete team win – every night it's somebody different. We're playing for each other, being selfless. We've got to keep it going." (AFP)

    Ohtani nominated for MVP after historic 2024 campaign

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was named among the nominees for Major League Baseball's National League Most Valuable Player award on Monday after a historic debut season with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is bidding for back-to-back MVP honours after winning the award last season while playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the American League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, who has already won two MVP awards in his career, is coming off a season which saw him become the first player in history to amass 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in the same season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old slugger also helped the Dodgers claim a second World Series in five seasons in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani faces competition from shortstop Francisco Lindor of the New York Mets and Arizona Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte.

  <br>
  In the American League meanwhile, New York Yankees teammates Aaron Judge and Juan Soto were nominated alongside Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MVP awards, which are voted on by a ballot of the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWA), will be announced on November 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there was a surprise in the nominees announced for the National League manager of the year award, with the Dodgers' World Series-winning manager Dave Roberts failing to make the cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roberts was tipped to be among the favourites after guiding the Dodgers to an MLB-best 98 regular season wins, despite having a pitching staff decimated by injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Roberts missed out, with Carlos Mendoza of the New York Mets, the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Murphy and the San Diego Padres' Mike Shildt named as the nominees. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner spent his first rest day at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday collecting the trophy for finishing the year ranked the number one tennis player in the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner entered the season-ending event already assured of becoming the first Italian to top the ATP end-of-year rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult," Sinner added, calling himself "very lucky".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian, who won his first match at finals on Sunday against Australian Alex De Minaur, succeeds Serbia's Novak Djokovic, who finished the year as world number one a record eight times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boris Becker, who spent 221 days at number one in 1991 but never ended a year on top, attended the presentation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that while "there are certainly Carlos Alcaraz and others, Jannik is going to be world number one for a long time." (AFP)

    Spain's Alcaraz beaten by Ruud in ATP Finals opener

<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Casper Ruud eased to a straight-sets victory over an out-of-sorts Carlos Alcaraz on Monday as the Spanish star's bid for a maiden ATP Finals title got off to a poor start.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud, 25, romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to win 6-1, 7-5 in Turin.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year, made 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired. I'm tired mentally," said Alcaraz. "Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some players deal with it better than others," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had two good times in Turin before – this part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well," said 2022 runner-up Ruud, who had suffered seven defeats in eight matches coming into this tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few days before coming here, I got sick at home," said the Spaniard. "I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses, but today I didn't feel well on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper," he added. " I have no experience playing on indoor courts – I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts." (AFP)

    Man Utd players hungry to learn from Amorim: Casemiro

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Casemiro says Manchester United's players are hungry to learn from new manager Ruben Amorim, who is expected to arrive in Britain on Monday to start the task of reviving the struggling club.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy's four-match reign as interim United boss ended with a 3-0 Premier League victory against Leicester on Sunday - a third win in four matches since Erik ten Hag was sacked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is looking forward to working with the Dutchman's highly rated successor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is very true, very loyal," Casemiro said after the win against Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting (Lisbon). We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think there is going to be a good template that everyone wants to grow, everyone wants to learn. I think that is the way to first help us grow to be at the top of the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, 39, will be unable to lead coaching sessions until his work permit is granted.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Portuguese coach is allowed at United's Carrington training ground for meetings, and talks with Van Nistelrooy will be high on his agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The popular former striker returned to Old Trafford in July as one of Ten Hag's assistants on a deal until 2026 and has been open about his desire to stay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's first match will be a trip to Ipswich on November 24, meaning there will be little time to implement his ideas and expected 3-4-3 formation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Casemiro's form has improved after a shaky start to the season, which included an error-strewn performance in a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Windsurfer Mui Ma on Monday overcame Britain's two-time Olympic bronze medallist Emma Wilson to win the iQFOiL women's category at the Hong Kong Windsurfing Open Championships, as fellow Olympian Alex Cheng claimed the top spot in the men's races to cap off the five-day event.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a welcome return to form for the Hong Kong pair, who made their Olympic debut in Paris in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  A dramatic ending to the women's event saw Ma, 26, secure a come-from-behind victory after edging Wilson in the 16th and final race of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair finished the event tied with a final score of 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overall champion is determined based on the results of the day's final race, with Ma's heroics in the final round helping her seal the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Alice Read and India's Ishwariya Ganesh ranked second and third respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's division, Cheng won 10 out of 16 matches to claim his second title since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another Hong Kong athlete, Jason Au, edged out Korea's Kim Chan-yi by three points to take second place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team will be heading to the iQFOiL Asian Windsurfing Championships from November 19 to 25.

    Messi, Inter Miami eliminated from MLS Cup playoffs

<img alt="Messi on the pitch in the first half against the Atlanta United FC. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778472_1_20241111084556.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi's goal of winning the MLS Cup title came to an abrupt end on Saturday with his Inter Miami suffering a shock first-round elimination from the playoffs after a 3-2 home defeat to Atlanta United FC.
 <br>
  <br>
  Miami had won the regular season campaign with a record points total but after losing twice in the best-of-three series, the MLS Cup favourites and their eight-times Ballon d'Or winner are out.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the accolades Miami received for their regular season 'Supporters' Shield' triumph count for little after an Atlanta team which finished ninth in the Eastern Conference pulled off a stunning upset.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter took the lead in the 17th minute when Messi was denied by a diving save from Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan but Matías Rojas followed in to slot home the loose ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Messi who finally broke through in the 65th minute, meeting a Marcelo Weigandt cross from the right with a thundering header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami pushed forward in search of the winner but instead they were caught out once again with Pedro Amador's cross from the left headed home at the back post by Polish midfielder Bartosz Slisz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter players were furious that the referee had allowed play to continue while their defender Tomás Avilés lay injured on the floor but their frustration was in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final whistle brought a deflated silence over Chase Stadium as Miami's season, which so many had expected would end with their first MLS Cup title, concluded with the sight of Guzan and his Atlanta team-mates celebrating.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Miami head coach Gerardo Martino, who won MLS Cup with Atlanta in 2018, an inquest is sure to follow but he tried to put a brave face on the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season has had good and bad things. If you think about where we were in November last year, there has obviously been progress in terms of the club, not just the team," he said. "If you think about the expectations we had for this playoffs, obviously we came up a little short," said the Argentine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martino said there was a despondent mood in the dressing room.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are sad, as they should be when there are so many expectations and the team can't fulfil them," he added. "In this final part of the year we got used to achieving the objectives but we couldn't achieve the most important one." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kansas City Chiefs preserved their unbeaten start to the NFL season after blocking a last-gasp field goal to snatch a dramatic 16-14 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The reigning Super Bowl champions looked poised to suffer their first defeat of the campaign after rookie Broncos quarterback Bo Nix expertly engineered a late fourth-quarter drive to the Kansas City 17-yard line.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left Wil Lutz with what should have been a straightforward 35-yard chip shot to win the game with the final kick of an absorbing clash at Arrowhead Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lutz and the Broncos were left stunned after Chiefs' defensive end Mike Danna got a hand to the kick to block the attempt and leave Kansas City exhaling a collective sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes raced across the field in celebration with his teammates as Kansas City sealed a win that sees them improve to 9-0 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just speaks to this entire team," Mahomes said of Kansas City's great escape. "I felt offensively we didn't do enough. Defensively we stepped it up in the second half, and then special teams – we're a full team. It's everybody, it was a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody believes, no one has any doubts, we just keep pushing and we found a way in the end," the 29-year-old Mahomes added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was hard on Broncos signal-caller Nix, who had shown superb composure throughout to help Denver take a 14-3 second quarter lead thanks to touchdown passes wide receivers Devaughn Vele and Courtland Sutton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's defense, meanwhile, gave Mahomes and the Chiefs offense a torrid time, sacking the Kansas City quarterback four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes, though, gradually got his team back into the game, connecting with Travis Kelce for a touchdown that made it 14-10 at the half, before two Harrison Butker field goals in the second half gave them a slender 16-14 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nix then appeared to have done enough to give Denver a chance at winning the game, only for the blocked field goal drama to deny the Broncos a famous win. (AFP)

    Man Utd win to end Van Nistelrooy's interim tenure

<img alt="Van Nistelrooy celebrates on pitch after the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778469_1_20241111083242.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy said his four games as interim manager of Manchester United was a "short but amazing period" after ending his run unbeaten with a 3-0 victory over Leicester on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman, who remains a legend at Old Trafford for his goal return during a glorious playing career, also oversaw victories over Leicester in the League Cup and PAOK in the Europa League either side of a 1-1 Premier League draw with Chelsea last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim will be in charge when the Red Devils next take the field away to Ipswich in two weeks' time, with Van Nistelrooy's own future still unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We said 'let's make the most of these four games', get the maximum out of it and I think we did a good job," said Van Nistelrooy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really enjoyed it, it's been a short but amazing period," he added. "We are in an uncertain position but we tried to do our jobs, and help the club which is important."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of feelings there, the way the fans supported me and the team always in difficult moments it was a special moment," he went on to say. "To close down this block of games with good results and a good connection I can't thank them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes continued his scoring streak under Van Nistelrooy with a powerful effort for his fourth goal in as many games.
  <br>
  <br>
  On his 250th appearance for the club, Fernandes also had a hand in the second goal as his header was deflected into his own net by Leicester defender Victor Kristiansen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho then came off the bench to rifle in a brilliant third goal as United shrugged off their problems in front of goal so far this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils remain down in 13th in the Premier League table but are only four points adrift of the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy returned to the club where he scored 150 goals in June as an assistant to Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision is yet to be made over whether he will have a role in Amorim's coaching team but the 48-year-old is proud of the work he has done in recent weeks to stabilise the club in troubled times.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We tried to stabilise after a difficult and emotional period. We wanted to get players performing at their best, we got the right feeling to them and got them believing in themselves," he added.

  <br>
  "This spell was a big responsibility, and I took it very seriously," Van Nistelrooy went on to say. "I wanted to help and get United into a better place – that was my goal. With three wins and a draw it's a standard where you want to grow to as a club." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal and Chelsea are nine points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after their 1-1 draw on Sunday, while Ipswich stunned Tottenham 2-1 for their first Premier League victory in 22 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are now winless in four Premier League games, as their bid for a first title since 2004 is at risk of unravelling.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners welcomed captain Martin Odegaard back to the starting line-up for the first time in two months and were much improved at Stamford Bridge, but still could not come away with a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very unlucky. We have dominated one of the best teams in Europe but we don't get the results – that is what is missing," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after the derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odegaard teed up Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring with a near-post shot on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea responded through Pedro Neto's brilliant long-range effort for his first league goal since a US$66 million move from Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has two new worries to add to what he describes as a nightmare run of injuries, after Bukayo Saka and Declan Rice both failed to finish the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rice went off after 71 minutes, and Saka was replaced 10 minutes later with both sustaining knocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't look good because for two players of that importance to say they want to come off is unusual," Arteta told reporters. "I don't expect them to be fit for the international break."
  <br>
  <br>
  A share of the spoils sees the Blues remain ahead of Arsenal on goal difference as both sides move into the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Ipswich will play host to Ruben Amorim's first match as Manchester United manager in two weeks, and go into that game buoyed by their first win since ending a two-decade wait to return to the top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a massive moment – one to cherish," said Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sammie Szmodics took advantage of statuesque Tottenham defending to open the scoring with an overhead kick on 31 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liam Delap doubled the visitors' lead in far less spectacular fashion as he lashed in from point-blank range after Radu Dragusin directed a cross towards his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs had come back to win in eight of the previous 12 league matches they conceded first at home this year but this time left themselves with too much to do.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Bentancur reduced the arrears with a powerful header from Pedro Porro's corner but they fell to a fifth league defeat in 11 games.
  <br>

    Sinner beats De Minaur in ATP Finals opener

<img alt="Sinner reacts after winning his match against Alex de Minuar at the ATP Finals. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778465_1_20241111081250.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner got his bid for a first ATP Finals title underway with a 6-3, 6-4 win over Alex de Minaur on Sunday as former champion Daniil Medvedev lost his head during his defeat to Taylor Fritz.
 <br>
  <br>
  Italian Sinner delighted supporters in Turin with a comfortable win over Finals debutant De Minaur to move first in the Ilie Nastase Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one, who hadn't played since winning the Shanghai Masters last month, only had one brief scare when his serve was broken early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he quickly recovered to rattle off four straight games and take the opening set to 5-2 before closing it out with his first set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner closed out a routine victory in emphatic fashion with a perfect service game and basked in the applause of his home fans after smashing an ace to finish in style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner, who lost last year's final to Novak Djokovic, tops the world rankings after a stunning season in which he claimed the Australian and US Opens – his first Grand Slam victories – and won five more ATP titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he has been dogged by controversy after twice testing positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, world number four Daniil Medvedev boiled with anger during his 6-4, 6-3 loss to American Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev destroyed his racket after going a set down and things went from bad to worse when Fritz broke serve to take a 4-2 lead in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev was docked a penalty point for throwing his racket at a courtside microphone and during game seven of the second set he held a new racket by its head while waiting for Fritz's serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the match Medvedev, whose behaviour was jeered by the crowd, replied "100 percent" when asked if he was hoping for the end of the season to come along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm tired to fight against something that doesn't depend on myself," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll see how it goes," he added. "Today actually I had my chances. I'll have them the next matches – if it doesn't work out, I go on holiday. I'm happy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Czech Barbora Krejcikova on Sunday called for respect and professionalism in sports media as she hit out at "unprofessional" remarks made about her appearance during a broadcast on the Tennis Channel.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wimbledon champion Krejcikova was competing at the WTA Finals in Riyadh this week, where she was beaten 6-3 7-5 by Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tennis Channel's coverage of the event on Friday, journalist Jon Wertheim, seemingly unaware that he was on air, made a comment about Krejcikova's forehead which was met with criticism on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As an athlete who has dedicated herself to this sport, it was disappointing to see this type of unprofessional commentary," world number 13 Krejcikova wrote in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This isn't the first time something like this is happening in (the) sports world. I've often chosen not to speak up, but I believe it's time to address the need for respect and professionalism in sports media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These moments distract from the true essence of sport and the dedication all athletes bring to the field. I love tennis deeply, and I want to see it represented in a way that honours the commitment we make to compete at this level." (Reuters)

    Cycling great Cavendish wins final race in Singapore

<img alt="Mark Cavendish says he intends to stay involved with cycling. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778424_1_20241110190800.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mark Cavendish sprinted to one last victory on Sunday as he took the Singapore Criterium in a signature surge to the line.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I really wanted that so bad," the 39-year-old Briton said after his 166th career victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm terribly emotional. I realised in the last five laps that this was the last 15 kilometres of my career. I passed the flamme rouge for the last time in my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coming out of the last bend, Cavendish, who holds the record for most stage wins in the Tour de France, briefly latched onto the wheel of defending champion Jasper Philipsen before pulling away. The Manxman had time to glance back before raising his arms in triumph one last time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975, having matched the Belgian's mark in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was so on the limit. I didn't race since the Tour de France so I am missing sharpness," said Cavendish who returned to the saddle to finish third in the Saitama Criterium on November 2, clinched by Biniam Girmay.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Criterium, organised by the Tour de France, covered 25 laps of a street circuit. Cavendish stayed in the peloton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was nervous about crashing, or something like that; not that there is anything wrong with that but I really wanted to finish," said Cavendish.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he intended to stay involved with cycling.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love this sport. I've always loved it," he said
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Tour de France isn't just a bike race it's the biggest annual sports event in the world, it's what children dream of. It's what adults dream of.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling is such a form of freedom. It's a way to be however you want to be. It has so much potential as a sport, as a mode of transport, as a pastime. I will do anything I can to help this move forward." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Olympic tennis champion Zheng Qinwen narrowly missed the title in her WTA Finals debut, losing to Coco Gauff of the United States 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  After the two players split the first two sets, Gauff came from 2-0 and 5-3 down in the final set and was two points from defeat at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet she took the set to a tiebreaker and won the first six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng threatened a comeback but Gauff took the victory off her third match point with a forehand winner as she came into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I was like a couple of points away from losing, but I just tried to stay in the moment honestly, and I'm really proud of myself," said Gauff, who's the first American to win the Finals since Serena Williams in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng was looking to complete a season in which she reached a grand slam final for the first time at the Australian Open and delivered China’s first Olympic tennis singles gold medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The match today, it’s just a couple of important points,” Zheng said. “The match was very close."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added, "And then I had a great season. It's my first time in the WTA Finals. Even though the final did not go in my way, I still got a lot of things to learn." (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia coach Joe Schmidt hailed Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii as an "aerial freak" after the cross-code capture marked his first senior game of rugby union by starring in the Wallabies' thrilling 42-37 win over England at Twickenham on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Suaalii, a multi million-dollar convert from rugby league, was named player of the match after posing problems for England under the high ball, with the outside centre's sublime pass also sending in full-back Tom Wright for the first of the Wallabies' five tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lead changed hands four times late on before, with England 37-35 ahead, Australia replacement back Max Jorgensen went over for the last of the game's 10 tries in the 84th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmidt, reflecting on Suaalii's performance, said: "I thought he was strong. I thought he was really well supported by Lenny Ikitau. Lenny was outstanding.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joseph obviously got a few kick-offs back for us. He's a bit of an aerial freak, but at the same time, it was a good learning experience for Joseph as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns had been expressed about whether pitching Suaalii into the cauldron of a Twickenham crowd of over 81,000 was a wise move.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Schmidt, a former Ireland coach, said: "I know there were some doubts expressed about him being selected and the risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people would now see the opportunity of involving a young man like that, " the New Zealander added.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was only Australia's second victory in 12 games against England and first over their old rivals at Twickenham since they knocked the Red Rose brigade out of the 2015 World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also followed a woeful return in this year's southern hemisphere Rugby Championship, where Australia lost five of their six games, and marked an ideal start to their Grand Slam tour, with struggling Wales next up for the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Three tries in the last five minutes to win it, lose it and win it, it was so up and down, but one thing that stayed up was the effort from our team," said Schmidt.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Jamie George, meanwhile, said the hosts had produced an "unacceptable" display after they missed 35 tackles against the Wallabies.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was England's fifth straight defeat by a leading rugby nation and followed last week's agonising 24-22 loss to New Zealand in their November opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  England coach Steve Borthwick lamented lost opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a game we should have won. We were in a position to win multiple times," Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you turn over that much ball and make the game that unstructured against a team with that much pace, you're giving them opportunities. We gave them far too many opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday, New Zealand ended Ireland's 19-match winning streak at Lansdowne Road, running out 23-13 victors over the world ranked number one side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Argentina launched their November international campaign with a ninth successive victory over Italy, winning 50-18 in Udine, and Antoine Dupont guided France to a 52-12 win over visiting Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later on Sunday, the Springboks play Scotland at Murrayfield, and Wales host Fiji in Cardiff. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat after blowing the lead to lose 2-1 at Brighton, allowing Liverpool to move five points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City had not suffered defeat in the league for nearly a year prior to losing at Bournemouth last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after also exiting the League Cup to Tottenham and being on the end of a 4-1 thrashing by Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Pep Guardiola has lost four straight matches for the first time in his illustrious managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions looked set to bounce back from their chastening night in Lisbon on Tuesday when Erling Haaland prodded in his 15th goal of the season at the second attempt after his initial effort was saved by Bart Verbruggen.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, though, were opened up at will in the second half and were finally punished by a pair of Brighton substitutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Pedro fired in the equaliser after City failed to clear in a goalmouth scramble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matt O'Riley has had to wait for his Premier League debut after suffering a serious ankle injury days after sealing a move from Celtic.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Danish international marked his bow in style when he slotted in from Pedro's pass seven minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not able to do 90 minutes right now. Four defeats in a row. We have to change things quick," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe after seven years winning six Premier Leagues, maybe one year another team deserves it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool kicked off at Anfield just 30 minutes later and quickly capitalised on City's latest slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a superb counter-attack in the 20th minute, Mohamed Salah was sent racing clear by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Salah tumbled to the turf under pressure, Darwin Nunez seized on the loose ball and fired high into the net from an acute angle for his third goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's composed finish in the 84th minute after another rapid Liverpool raid sealed their ninth win in 11 league games and 15th victory in 17 matches in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chasing a first English title since 2020, Liverpool, who finished a distant third to City last season, have been revitalised following Arne Slot's arrival from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp as manager in the close-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa have slumped to eighth place after losing their last four games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves ended a wait since April for a Premier League win by beating fellow strugglers Southampton 2-0 to move off the foot of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gary O'Neil was under huge pressure to deliver after a 13-game winless run in the top flight and got the perfect start when Pablo Sarabia swept home Matheus Cunha's pass for Wolves' fastest ever Premier League goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cunha smashed home a stunning second goal himself early in the second period to give Wolves a vital three points, which sees Southampton replace them at the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's huge for us. He has such ability," said O'Neil on Cunha's influence. "A big win for us and Matheus Cunha had a big say in it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham moved into seventh by inflicting more misery on Crystal Palace with a 2-0 win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe put Fulham ahead and Palace's Daichi Kamada saw red for a wild lunge on Kenny Tete before Harry Wilson wrapped up the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoane Wissa scored a brace as Brentford twice came from behind to beat Bournemouth 3-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice the in-form Cherries led through Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Bees have taken 16 points from a possible 18 at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford quickly levelled on both occasions through Wissa and Mikkel Damsgaard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wissa then completed the comeback with his seventh goal in eight league appearances this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham and Everton did little to quell the discontent among both fanbases in a 0-0 draw. (AFP)

 Cycling great Mark Cavendish announced his retirement from the sport on Saturday, writing on social media that his final race will be Sunday's Tour de France Singapore Criterium.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Sunday will be the final race of my professional cycling career," wrote the 39-year-old British rider, the record stage winner on the Tour de France with 35, in a post on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling has given me so much and I love the sport. I've always wanted to make a difference in it and now I am ready to see what the next chapter has in store for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am lucky enough to have done what I love for almost 20 years and I can now say that I have achieved everything that I can on the bike," the rider from the Isle of Man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish won the world road race title in 2011 and an omnium silver medal at the 2016 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over two decades he won 165 races, including 17 stages in the Giro d'Italia and three in the Vuelta a Espana. (AFP)

    Japan's Sasaki set to follow Ohtani with move to MLB

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hotly tipped Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki was on Saturday given the green light to follow in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and move to Major League Baseball.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki, widely regarded as one of the best players in Japan's domestic league, will be posted for a potential move to the US, his club the Chiba Lotte Marines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means MLB clubs will have the right to bid for the 23-year-old right-hander this offseason, in an agreement between the Japanese and American leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki threw a perfect game in April 2022 and was part of the Japan team that won last year's World Baseball Classic alongside Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani won his first MLB championship last month when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki said he had "nothing but gratitude" to the Marines for agreeing to post him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You only get one baseball career and I don't want to have any regrets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meet the expectations of everyone who has pushed me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki's father and grandparents were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  His house was swept away when the earthquake unleashed a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing, and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. (AFP)

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers maintain their perfect start to the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778284_1_20241109122355.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their perfect start to the NBA season in sensational style on Friday, seizing a 41-point halftime lead on the way to a 136-117 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 10-0, ending the Warriors' five-game winning streak and handing them their first road defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The damage was done early, the Cavs' 83 first-half points tying a franchise record for most scored in any half and their 41-point halftime lead the biggest in team history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the Warriors' second-ranked defense, the Cavs posted their fifth game of the young season with at least 130 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ties a team record for the most 130-plus point games for an entire season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten-0 is a magic number," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. "We're playing really good basketball and I'm just really pleased where the group is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was worried about tonight - they're 7-1 and rolling and they're coming in here, they're champions and they're going to try and knock our block off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 27 points, Evan Mobley added 23 and Ty Jerome chipped in 20 off the bench as six Cavs players scored in double figures against a Warriors defense that came in ranked second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, they kept the potentially explosive Warriors offense in check, opening the game on a 20-2 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way we came out tonight, that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins with nine points and Stephen Curry with seven were the only Warriors starters to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State were able to adjust after the break, out-scoring the Cavs 41-29 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors, however, were in too deep a hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 21 points off the bench, Curry finished with 12 on five-of-10 shooting, making just one from three-point range. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ineos Britannia has been accepted as the Challenger of Record for the next edition of the America's Cup sailing competition, organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory against their British opponents on October 19 and the challenge was lodged immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) and Emirates Team New Zealand are pleased to confirm that the RNZYS has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 38th America's Cup (AC38) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Limited, represented by Ineos Britannia, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC38," said a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton said: "The 38th America's Cup effectively started the moment the team crossed the finish line in Barcelona on 19th October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very exciting to have continuity with the Challenger of Record, Ineos Britannia, to continue to build the scale of the America's Cup globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AC38 would be a "multi-challenger event." At this year's America's Cup, Ineos Britannia won a qualifying event that enabled them to take on the defending champions for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Yacht Squadron said it would "work alongside The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron" to deliver the protocol for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The class of yacht will be the AC75 and teams will be restricted to building one boat.
  <br>
  <br>
  No date has yet been set but the statement from the organisers said it is "intended that the AC38 match be held within three years of the completion of the AC37 match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team New Zealand won the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time to end the best-of-13 series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British boat was skippered by four-time Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie and is bankrolled by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemical group Ineos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

    F1 takes on FIA chief in open letter amid swearing row

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One drivers on Thursday blasted the "tone and language" used by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem amid a row over swearing at press conferences.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an open letter, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) also demanded that competitors be treated like adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several drivers, including three-time world champion Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Monaco's Charles Leclerc, were recently sanctioned by the FIA for swearing at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Ben Sulayem has spoken out in favour of measures to ensure drivers no longer use foul language.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the GPDA hit back with a letter posted on social media regarding 'Driver Misconduct'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as an F1 car, or a driving situation," the letter read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the FIA president to consider his own tone and language when talking to our member drivers, or indeed about them, whether in a public forum or otherwise," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, our members are adults," it went on to say. "They do not need to be given instructions via the media, about matters as trivial as the wearing of jewellery or underpants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has clashed with FIA bosses for wearing jewellery at races, with the governing body also reminding drivers of the need to wear flame-resistant underwear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GPDA also stressed its opposition to financial sanctions against drivers and called on Ben Sulayem to clarify how they are imposed and how their proceeds are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Ben Sulayem, team bosses and drivers have deteriorated in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FIA president was accused at the start of the year of trying to derail the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix and influence the results of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In both cases, the Emirati was cleared by the FIA Ethics Committee. (AFP)

    World number two Swiatek crashes out of WTA Finals

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the WTA Finals on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova defeated Coco Gauff to secure her spot in the semi-finals at the expense of the Pole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Wimbledon champion claimed a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Gauff to end the title defence of Swiatek, who needed Krejcikova to lose in order to progress from the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one win and one loss under her belt entering the last day of round-robin play, Swiatek's 6-1, 6-0 victory over alternate Daria Kasatkina did not have any bearing on her qualification chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only scenario that would have led to Swiatek's advancement to the semi-finals would have been a Gauff win over Krejcikova.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result did not materialise though, and Krejcikova punched her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals for the first time – on her second singles appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova moves forward as the winner of the Orange Group, and will face Zheng Qinwen in Friday's last-four stage, with Gauff of the United States advancing as the runner-up to set up a semi-final showdown with world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Definitely this is a big win for me. I'm really happy with how I played and with my performance today. It was a really big match," said Krejcikova, who saved a remarkable 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Playing tomorrow again is something unimaginable before this tournament and I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just fighting for every ball, and I knew it's going to be difficult because I know Coco is on a roll and she's one of the best players this season," she added. "That was a huge challenge but also the big prize, the semis was on the table – I am super excited to be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff saved two match points in a 10-minute final game and had three opportunities to break Krejcikova but the eighth seed would not fold, and she scooped the victory with a service winner after one hour and 42 minutes of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova, who has won just 21 matches this season, earned her place in the WTA Finals field due to a new rule introduced by the Tour in 2024, which gives priority to a reigning Grand Slam champion over the eighth-ranked player in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova grabbed the last spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro, who chose not to come to Saudi Arabia as an alternate. (AFP)

    Mbappé left out of France squad for internationals

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé has been left out of the France squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches against Israel and Italy, with coach Didier Deschamps insisting the absence of the Real Madrid superstar "is for the best".
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the second successive France squad from which the national team captain has been absent after he also missed the October double-header against Israel and Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have spoken with him and I have made the decision for this get-together because I think it is for the best," Deschamps told reporters at a press conference in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé was rested for last month's matches in order to help him recover from a minor thigh injury suffered playing for Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that quickly became a source of controversy when he returned to action for Real days later, before France had even played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé was absent for France's 4-1 win over Israel in a game played in Budapest and a 2-1 win in Belgium, and instead travelled to Stockholm for a short break with members of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was following that trip that Swedish media reported he was being investigated for an alleged rape. Mbappé himself said those reports were "fake news", while his lawyer said the player would take action for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Swedish prosecutor confirmed that an investigation had been opened, without naming Mbappe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not going to set out my argument, but I can say two things. The first is that Kylian wanted to come," Deschamps added. "The second is that it is not to do with the off-field problems because the presumption of innocence exists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last month's controversy, the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward has made four appearances for his club, scoring one goal. However, he remains short of his explosive best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to say any more about it. I stand by my decision," Deschamps added.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are second in Group A2 of the Nations League, one point behind leaders Italy, ahead of their final two fixtures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They host Israel at the Stade de France next Thursday, November 14, and then play Italy in Milan three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are five points clear of Belgium in third place and the top two teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, which will take place over two legs next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will be played next June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran midfielder N'Golo Kante, of Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, returns to the squad along with Adrien Rabiot of Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there is a first call-up for highly-rated Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who takes the place of West Ham United's Alphonse Areola in the squad. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

    Raygun retires from breaking, citing Olympic backlash

<img alt="Australia's Rachael Gunn competing against France's Sya Dembele in the Paris Olympics. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777941_1_20241107112433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn has announced her retirement from competition, citing "really upsetting" backlash following her performance at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Raygun's unorthodox routine – including kangaroo hops and imitating a sprinkler – failed to impress the judges at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her moves were copied on late-night talk shows and her unfashionable green tracksuit was mercilessly parodied online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspiracy theories abounded to explain how the university lecturer had even made it on to the Australia Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn said the intense scrutiny had been "really upsetting", and she had decided to pull the plug on her breakdancing career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to compete any more," she told Australian radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. "I was going to keep competing for sure, but that seems like a really difficult thing for me to do now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level of scrutiny that's going to be there," she added. "People will be filming it, it will be going online, it's just not going to be the same experience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn had previously spoken out against the "pretty devastating" hatred unleashed towards her after the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went out there and I had fun – I did take it very seriously. I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics, and I gave my all," she said in a video message after the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many lampooned her performance on social media, Gunn won support from others, including her fellow Australian Olympians and even the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun said she would continue to dance, just not in competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel bad about the way that they dance," she added. "If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor – then just own it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun did have the last laugh in September when she was briefly elevated to the top of the World Dance Sport Federation rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WDSF named her the number one women's breakdancer based on winning the Oceania Championship, one of only a few events held that counted towards the rankings in the run-up to the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympics debut in Paris, but will not feature at the next Games at Los Angeles in 2028. (AFP)

    Inter Milan sink Arsenal in Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hakan Calhanoglu penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italian champions remain undefeated in the competition this season and sit fifth on ten points at the midway point of the new league phase format.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think we played a great game against a strong side who play with great intensity," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced defeat for the first time in Europe this season and lie three points and seven places behind their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match at the San Siro looked set to go into the break goalless until a penalty was signalled against Mikel Merino after Mehdi Taremi's flick deviated the ball into the Arsenal player's raised hand from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very harshly done by," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "There is no deflection, nothing you can do in the box – so can he get away from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Calhanoglu stroked home the resulting spot-kick three minutes into first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yann Sommer and Denzel Dumfries combined on the line to deny Gabriel Magalhaes a leveller shortly before the hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal cranked up the pressure in the second half but were unable to break down Inter's solid defensive block as the Premier League side fell to a second defeat in four days. (AFP)

    Zheng into last four of WTA Finals, Sabalenka loses

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen continued to deliver in her breakthrough season as she advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Wednesday with victory over Jasmine Paolini, while Elena Rybakina beat the already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka.
 <br>
  <br>
  Picking up a 30th win from her last 35 matches, Chinese Olympic gold medallist Zheng swept past the fourth-seeded Italian 6-1, 6-1 in a mere 67 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Rybakina claimed a consolation 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number one Sabalenka, who had already secured her semi-final spot as the group winner on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eliminated from the competition after losing her opening two matches, Rybakina found her form against Sabalenka – a much-needed confidence boost for the world number five after missing the majority of the second half of the season with allergies, insomnia and a back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a tough match and I'm really happy that I managed to win. I think it's nice to finish the year at least with one win against the world number one," said Rybakina, who shared a warm embrace with Sabalenka at the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the second loss Sabalenka has suffered in her last 24 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, 26, must wait to find out who she will face in Friday's semi-finals, but has reason to celebrate despite defeat as she clinched the year-end number one ranking as a result of Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Belarusian said she will not let her new ranking distract her from the task at hand – lifting the WTA Finals trophy for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a really great feeling but I figured that last night and it didn't work really well tonight for me so I just want to focus on the current tournament to stay hungry and stay motivated – it's a big tournament and it's also one of my goals, so I'll focus on this goal," Sabalenka said Wednesday.

    Atlético stun PSG in Champions League clash

<img alt="Correa celebrates after scoring the late winner for Atlético. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777905_1_20241107074910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Ángel Correa scored a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Atlético Madrid snatched a 2-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kickstarting their Uefa Champions League campaign and casting a large cloud over the French club's European hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  It looked as if the game at the Parc des Princes would end in a draw after Warren Zaire-Emery's early opener for PSG was quickly cancelled out by Nahuel Molina, in what was the first ever meeting of the clubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG have been let down by their finishing in the Champions League all season and that was the case again here as they failed to convert a host of chances, but Atletico did not look like winning it until Correa struck in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniards would have been the happier of the two teams with a draw, especially as goalkeeper Jan Oblak had been forced into several second-half saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost back-to-back matches against Benfica and Lille, the win puts Atlético back on track to at least make the play-off round of this new-look Champions League, with the league phase now at the halfway stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The evening was also notable for the pre-match unfurling by PSG fans at one end of the stadium of an enormous banner in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "War on the pitch but peace in the world," said the banner, which also featured a Lebanese flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  That may lead to disciplinary action from Uefa, but that will probably be the least of PSG's worries right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  They may be comfortably on top of Ligue 1 but in the Champions League last season's semi-finalists have just four points, despite playing three of their four games so far at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having edged Girona 1-0 on the opening matchday and then lost 2-0 away to Arsenal, the French champions have since drawn at home to PSV Eindhoven and now lost to Atlético.
  <br>
  <br>
  They face a tough assignment next away to Bayern Munich and also still have to play Manchester City, meaning their hopes of finishing in the top 24 places and qualifying at least for the play-off round must be in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique's side will need to quickly improve in front of goal having now scored just three times in their last six Champions League matches, a run stretching back to last season's semi-final loss against Borussia Dortmund. (AFP)

 Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in," said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things "a bit more tricky and different than usual".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match," the Pole added. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Champions League holders Real Madrid fell to a 3-1 home defeat by AC Milan on Tuesday in the group stage with striker Kylian Mbappé unable to find the net again.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old France captain has scored once in his last six matches for Madrid across all competitions, including three losses for Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Thiaw headed the Italian side ahead before Vinicius Junior levelled from the penalty spot for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvaro Morata struck against his former side to restore Milan's lead before the break and Tijjani Reijnders netted the third to secure Milan's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were unable to bounce back strongly from the 4-0 thrashing by Barcelona in late October, their last outing after Saturday's La Liga match at Valencia was postponed because of devastating floods in the east of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players from both sides wore t-shirts before the match reading "We are all Valencia" while in one stand a giant Valencia regional flag was unfurled for a minute's silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 90 minutes that followed, Paulo Fonseca's Milan, seventh in Serie A, outclassed Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going through a period when our opponents are punishing us a lot and we have to keep working so that this doesn't happen again," Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez told Movistar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos have let in nine goals in their last three home matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be worried, the team's not giving a good account of itself," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team is not compact, we have to be more compact, more organised, we've let in a lot of goals," he added. "We're not well organised on the pitch, and we have to work on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Milan have won the competition seven times, behind only record 15-time champions Madrid, but have not reached a final since 2007, when Ancelotti led them to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This victory harked back to their glory days and Fonseca praised his team's bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players came here with courage, didn't have any fear – in the first half we created plenty, and in the second half we were on the back foot, but we fought together," said the Portuguese coach. "We definitely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice as a player and then twice as a coach with Milan, only made one change from the Clasico humiliation, bringing in Luka Modric for Eduardo Camavinga. (AFP)

    Injured Djokovic withdraws from ATP Finals

<img alt="Djokovic after winning third place in the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777736_1_20241106080832.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic said on Tuesday he will not defend his ATP Finals title due to an "ongoing injury" which has ended the 24-time Grand Slam champion's season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tennis icon Djokovic was one of four players still battling for one of three remaining places at the season-ending event in Turin, which kicks off on Sunday, but said on social media that he wouldn't be making a bid for a third straight Finals title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really looking forward to being there, but due to ongoing injury I won't be playing next week," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apologies to those who were planning to see me," the statement added. "Wishing all the players a great tournament. See you soon!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb, currently ranked fifth in the world, sits sixth in "The Race", the ATP's annual rankings to determine the eight competitors at the Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Taylor Fritz had already qualified before Djokovic's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  His retirement from the tournament automatically opens up the final three places to Casper Ruud, Alex de Minaur and Andrey Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruud and Rublev are playing in Metz, France this week, with De Minaur in action in Belgrade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic's withdrawal was not a surprise as he had already pulled out of the Paris Masters, effectively ending what has been a difficult season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't won a single ATP title in 2024, the first time that has happened since 2006, and has been shoved aside by young stars Sinner and Alcaraz at the top of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic did, however, win singles gold at the Paris Olympics, adding the final major honour which was missing from his record-breaking list of career achievements. (AFP)

    Amorim's Sporting stun Man City in Champions League
   </title>

<img alt="Amorim is celebrated by his players at the end of his final home game with Sporting. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777733_1_20241106075002.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Viktor Gyokeres's hat-trick fired Sporting Lisbon to a stunning 4-1 rout of Manchester City in the Uefa Champions League as Ruben Amorim showed why Manchester United were so keen to lure him to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporting manager Amorim accepted United's offer to replace Erik ten Hag,  and will officially take charge of the troubled Premier League club on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarded as one of Europe's brightest young managerial minds, the 39-year-old delivered a tantalising glimpse of his acumen as Sporting exposed injury-hit City's defensive weaknesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden put City ahead in the opening moments at the Jose Alvalade stadium, but the visitors wasted a string of chances to increase their lead and Sporting made them pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gyokeres equalised before half-time and Maximiliano Araujo bagged Sporting's second after the break before Gyokeres's penalty capped their incredible fightback with two penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland squandered a chance to give City a second half lifeline when his penalty hit the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said United fans might think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the turbulent end to Ten Hag's reign – he was sacked in October with United languishing in the bottom half of the table – Amorim clearly faces a huge task to restore the club to the glory they enjoyed in the Ferguson era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparisons with United's legendary former boss should be shelved for now, but Sporting's spirited victory will have fans counting down the days until his arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who led Sporting to two Portuguese titles in four years, is set to take charge of his first United game at Ipswich on November 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola will get his chance for revenge in Amorim's first Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola has plenty to work on before then as he looks for solutions to City's unexpected three-game losing streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a fantastic first half, now we are struggling to score. We create and concede when the opponents don't do much," Guardiola said. "At 2-1 down, many things can happen. Emotionally, we were not stable enough – and in this competition, you have to be stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City suffered a first top-flight defeat of the season against Bournemouth on Saturday, three days after losing to Tottenham in the League Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the absences of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias, John Stones and Oscar Bobb, City have lost their momentum in dramatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their first defeat in four games in this season's Champions League shouldn't be fatal to their European ambitions, but Guardiola will be desperate for a positive reaction at Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's heaviest defeat since 2020 meant, for only the second time in the Guardiola era, they had suffered three consecutive losses in a single season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting, meanwhile, have 10 points from four Champions League games as Amorim leaves them in rude health. (AFP)

<img alt="The Rugby Sevens in March will be held at the Kai Tak Stadium for the first time. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777647_1_20241105162129.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

    Rank outsider Knight's Choice wins the Melbourne Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rank outsider Knight's Choice upset favourite Buckaroo on Tuesday to win the A$8 million (US$5.25 million) Melbourne Cup, earning Irish jockey Robbie Dolan a debut victory in Australia's "race that stops a nation".
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-year-old Australian-bred gelding came home by a nose in a photo finish ahead of Japanese raider Warp Speed and the Jamie Kah-ridden Okita Soushi in the energy-sapping two-mile handicap at Flemington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pinch me, I'm dreaming," said 28-year-old Dolan, a part-time singer who was riding in the famous race for the first time. "It is incredible. I can't believe it. I don't even know what to say."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like I've ridden it 10 times because I have ridden it in my head 100 times," he added. "I can't put it into words – it's the biggest race in the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a huge breakthrough for Dolan, who was previously best-known for appearing on The Voice, an Australian singing show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be singing tonight after a few beers," he said, overcome with emotion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckaroo, priced as the A$7.00 favourite, finished ninth while the fancied Vauban could only manage 11th on a warm and sunny day, with the track firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cultural institution in Australia, the Melbourne Cup has been run since 1861 and is considered so important it is a public holiday in its host state of Victoria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held in front of a bumper crowd, drinking and socialising took priority over racing for many, with the sound of popping champagne corks accompanying the thundering of hooves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from barrier six, the John Symons and Sheila Laxon-trained Knight's Choice, an 80-1 shot, settled towards the back of the 23-strong pack behind early leader Just Fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 1,000m to go, Just Fine was still ahead but was slowly reeled in down the home straight and finished last, with Knight's Choice surging from 20th at the final turn for a thrilling victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a second win for Laxon, who became the first woman to train a Melbourne Cup winner in 2001 with Ethereal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He did, he did," she said, lavishing praise on Dolan. "We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Symons added: "I was worried. He got further back than we talked about, but great ride. What a thrill. What a thrill."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Zahra, who rode the last two Melbourne Cup winners – Without a Fight and Gold Trip – was denied a hat-trick aboard Circle of Fire, finishing sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Kerrin McEvoy's bid for a record-equalling fourth win was also unsuccessful, with his horse Absurde fifth. A record four women jockeys took part with Kah faring best on Okita Soushi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Payne is the only woman rider to win the Melbourne Cup after she steered Prince of Penzance to victory in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one withdrawal by stewards before the race started with French import Athabascan found to have an irregular heartbeat, reducing the field to 23. (AFP)

    Fulham strike twice in stoppage time to beat Brentford

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Wilson struck twice in stoppage time to give Fulham a dramatic 2-1 victory over west London rivals Brentford on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vitaly Janelt had blasted the Bees in front against the run of play midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham were frustrated until added time when substitute Wilson flicked home the equaliser and then head in a winner at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an amazing feeling to come on and get the two goals to win the game. We deserved it, we kept them pinned in throughout," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Marco Silva's men up to ninth and just three points off the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had been headed for the top half themselves until the late turnaround, but instead remain in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham failed to make the most of a purposeful start as Reiss Nelson was denied by Mark Flekken.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had barely threatened prior to going in front on 24 minutes when Janelt took aim from distance and fired a blistering shot past Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe wasted a big chance to reply immediately and the home side struggled to break through Brentford's mass ranks of defence after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took until Fulham's 25th attempt on goal to beat Flekken, as Wilson's inventive effort looped over the Dutch goalkeeper from Adama Traore's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, the Welsh international had a fortuitous second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's attempted header came off his shoulder to wrong-foot Flekken and flew into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They both went in, but not how I would have wanted" Wilson added. "The first one I just helped it on to the back post, and the second one was more lucky." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland poured in 39 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers fended off a late Milwaukee surge to beat the Bucks 116-114 on Monday and push their perfect NBA record to 8-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Garland drilled a step-back three-pointer to put Cleveland up 113-111 with 45 seconds to play, then fed Jarrett Allen for a dagger layup as the Cavs, who led by as many as 19 in the second quarter, matched the franchise's best start to a season – also achieved in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to get one win, so eight is crazy," Garland said. "I'm happy we got eight – we've got to keep this thing going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out with an adductor strain, dropped their sixth straight game – coming up short again after a one-point home loss to the Cavs on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee point guard Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 36 points in the third quarter as the Bucks battled back to lead 91-89 heading into the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  They pushed the lead to eight points midway through the fourth, but a three-pointer from Garland ignited a 10-0 scoring run that put the Cavs up by two. Lillard would briefly put Milwaukee back in front but the Cavs had enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 17 points and Allen finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and a massive block on Lillard with eight seconds to play that sealed the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to fight for 48 minutes," Garland said. "We knew they were going to come out in the second half and try to be more aggressive – it was a great all-around team effort."
  <br>
  <br>
  On a busy night that saw every team in action before a pause for the US presidential election on Tuesday, the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers 115-103 while the reigning champion Boston Celtics romped past the Hawks 123-93 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golden State Warriors welcomed Stephen Curry back from a three-game injury absence with a 125-112 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 17 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the third triple-double of his career and Jaden Ivey scored 26 points to power the Pistons to their third win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 37 points for the Lakers, but appeared to be troubled by a left foot or ankle injury in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James scored 20 points with eight rebounds and 11 assists, but the Pistons seized the lead in the first quarter and remained in control the rest of the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors led all the way in Washington, with Curry scoring a team-high 24 points in his first game since he tweaked his left ankle on October 27. (AFP)

    Top-ranked Nelly Korda wins LPGA Player of Year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda has clinched her first LPGA Player of the Year honours, the LPGA confirmed on Monday after it became mathematically impossible for anyone to catch her for the points-based award.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an already historic 2024 campaign America's Korda has six victories and three additional top-10 finishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her wins included a record-equalling run of five straight capped by her second major title at the Chevron Championship, and she represented the United States at the Paris Olympics and in the Solheim Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda skipped two tournaments on the recent Asian swing after a neck injury limited her ability to practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ayaka Furue of Japan, winner of the Evian Championship in July, would have had to win the rest of the LPGA events this year to catch up, but tied for 10th in the Japan Classic on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning the Rolex Player of the Year means so much to me," the 26-year-old Korda said in a statement. "This season has had its highs and challenges, and I'm just really grateful for the people around me who have helped me get here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is expected to tee it up in two more tournaments this year, including the season-ending Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, from November 21 to 24. (AFP)

    Olympic champion Lyles misses out track athlete award

<img alt="Lyles on the podium after the men's 200-metre athletics event at Paris 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777595_1_20241105095925.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic 100-metre champion Noah Lyles is not one of the two finalists for male track athlete of the year, World Athletics revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lyles won one of the closest Olympic finals in history to take gold in Paris in August by five thousandths of a second from Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lyles misses out as 200-metre Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Norway's 5,000-metre gold medallist Jakob Ingebrigtsen were the two male track athletes to make the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was aiming for an Olympic sprint double but had to settle for the 200m bronze medal behind Tebogo and his US teammate Kenny Bednarek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyles later revealed he had raced in the 200-metre despite testing positive for Covid-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the winner of the Olympic women's 100-metre final, Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, is one of the two women's track finalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will be up against Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the American who broke her own world record to win the Olympic 400-metre hurdles title for a second time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics said the top two in each category – track, field and out of stadium – were chosen from a first round of voting, which comprised votes from the World Athletics Council, officials and dignitaries connected to the sport known as the "World Athletics Family", and a public vote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a new addition to this year's awards, a final round of votes cast by fans of the sport from Monday until November 10 will decide the overall World Athlete of the Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the field events, Olympic men's pole vault champion and world record holder Mondo Duplantis will be hot favourite to take the men's award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede is up against Miltiadis Tentoglou of Greece, who won the men's long jump gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who broke the 37-year-old women's world record with a clearance of 2.10-metre four weeks before taking Olympic gold, will go head-to-head with three-time Olympic heptathlon champion Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's out-of-stadium award pits world marathon record holder Ruth Chepng'etich of Kenya against Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won the Olympic marathon in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's category Brian Pintado, the Ecuadorean gold medallist in the 20-kilometre race walk at the Paris Games, will compete against Olympic men's marathon champion Tamirat Tola from Ethiopia. (AFP)

    Sabalenka through to WTA Finals semis, Zheng cruises

<img alt="Sabalenka during her group-stage match against Paolini. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777575_1_20241105081016.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka has secured qualification for the semi-finals stage of the WTA Finals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Jasmine Paolini, as Zheng Qinwen ended Elena Rybakina's chances of moving on in Riyadh on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With two round-robin wins in as many matches this week in Saudi Arabia, Sabalenka guaranteed herself passage to the final four as the winner of the Purple Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belarusian top seed is also just one victory away from locking down the year-end number one ranking, which she is in a direct battle with Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka bounced back from 0-2 down in the second set, and saved two set points at 4-5 to overcome Italian fourth seed Paolini and has now won 22 of her last 23 matches on tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second set was quite tricky. Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and show her that I'm going to fight for this set no matter what and I'm really happy I was able to win in straight sets," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Halfway through the second set I was already thinking about the third set," she added. "But I was like, wait, wait, it's not the third set until it's the third set – I'm happy all those shots on set points went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chinese Olympic medallist improved her chances of advancing to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number five Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Zheng rebounded from her opening round-robin defeat to Sabalenka by claiming her first win from three meetings with Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina suffered her second defeat of the week in Saudi Arabia, and has no chance of reaching the semi-finals – with one more round-robin clash to go against Sabalenka on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng apologised to the crowd during her on-court interview for yelling, 'Don't shout more', at some of her supporters at a crucial moment in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She thanked them for their support and later acknowledged she could have handled the moment better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt today in such an important moment, when they shout so hard my name, my heart rate goes up. So I hold and hold, until one moment I can't hold more," Zheng said during her post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm feeling a bit bad, because if I can control my emotions a bit better, I was supposed not to say that to my crowd."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng arrived in Riyadh on the back of an impressive second half of the season that saw her win titles in Palermo and Tokyo, and an Olympic gold medal in singles in Paris. No woman has won more matches than her within that span.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first Chinese player to qualify for the WTA Finals since Li Na in 2013, Zheng amassed a 12-2 win-loss record during the Asian swing last month and is the tour leader in most aces struck and percentage of first-serve points won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Olympic champion now owns a tour-leading 20 three-set wins in 2024 – the highest tally by a WTA player in a single season since 2016. (AFP)

    Rams beat Seahawks in overtime thriller, Lions cruise

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tense battle in Seattle saw the Los Angeles Rams come away with a 26-20 overtime NFL win on Demarcus Robinson's one-handed catch of a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seahawks had scored on a 14-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but could not score on the opening drive of the extra session.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Rams needing only a field goal after stuffing the Seahawks on fourth down on the first possession of overtime, Stafford went for the win by throwing a deep ball to Robinson, who was well covered by cornerback Riq Woolen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams, who have now won three straight after losing four of their previous five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions dominated the Green Bay Packers in a 24-14 victory at rain-lashed Lambeau Field on Sunday, winning the battle for supremacy in the NFC North division.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Kerby Joseph returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown to help the Lions take control in the highly anticipated matchup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green Bay struck for an early field goal, but the Lions took the lead for good when quarterback Jared Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown with a three-yard touchdown pass in the first minute of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added a field goal and a touchdown in the final minute of the first half as Joseph reeled in a pass from an under-pressure Packers quarterback Jordan Love and raced up the sideline to the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit scored 24 points before the Packers produced a second field goal. A late Green Bay touchdown made the score more respectable, but the Lions were in control throughout as they improved to 7-1 – the best record in the NFC – for the first time since 1956.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a fun game," Goff said. "In Green Bay, in Lambeau, we're supposed to be the 'dome team' – we're supposed to be the team that can't play outside – and we came in here and win." (AFP/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Tom Latham on Sunday said his team's 3-0 Test sweep in India was one of the "greatest series wins" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Caps won the third Test by 25 runs on Sunday at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to hand India only their second series whitewash at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand – cricket's perennial underdogs – turned around their fortunes from a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka in September to make India suffer their first Test series loss at home in 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand cricket, probably one of New Zealand cricket's greatest series wins I think," said Latham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, all we can do is keep playing cricket and keep playing our brand of cricket," he added. "We've felt a lot of support over the last couple of weeks, which is really special."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand host England for three Tests starting November 28 in Christchurch followed by matches in Wellington and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got three more big games back home," said Latham. "We've got sell-out crowds in a couple of the games – which is all you can ask for from a cricketer's point of view."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mumbai-born New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel stood out in the final Test with a match-haul of 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took five in the first innings and then six to help bowl out India for 121 in their chase of 147 and Latham praised his match-winner as "fantastic". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time world champion Max Verstappen produced a virtuoso drive in often atrocious conditions to regain control of this year's world championship on Sunday when he charged from 17th on the grid to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Without a win in 10 races since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Red Bull's series leader made light of the chaotic, rain-swept conditions to register a 62nd career triumph and fastest lap while nearest title rival Lando Norris of McLaren went from pole position to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman's triumph lifted him to 393 points, increasing his advantage over Norris, on 331, to 62 with just three Grands Prix and one sprint race remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen finished 19.477 seconds ahead of Alpine's French duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly with Mercedes' George Russell fourth and Charles Leclerc fifth for Ferrari in a tumultuous contest of accidents, two red-flag stoppages, penalties and planned post-race investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Alpine, the reward was a leap from ninth to sixth in the constructors championship, reportedly valued at an estimated US$50 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris, who struggled to find his usual pace, came home sixth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB's Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen's success came on the day he overhauled Michael Schumacher's record of leading the drivers standings for 896 days while many of his rivals faced post-race investigations for various sporting misdemeanours.

  "My emotions have been a rollercoaster today – that unlucky qualifying and starting 17th made it such a tough race, but we stayed out of trouble, made the right calls and it is unbelievable to win here from so far back," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," said a beaming Ocon. "After this difficult season, it's so nice to drive here and the rain levelled out the performance so I am very happy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I had to play like this to win today," said Zverev, who opened his victory speech by apologising to the crowd at Paris' Bercy Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Ugo on an incredible week, he's an incredible player,": he added. "If you continue like this, you'll be able to lift trophies like this. This is not your last chance, Ugo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev's victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the season-ending showpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Zverev for the quality of the tennis he has played all this week, and season," said Humbert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came as a kid to watch matches at the Paris Masters, and it made me want to do what I do," he added. "So I'm very happy to have reached the final." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's Diana Shnaider won her fourth WTA title of a breakout season on Sunday as she blew away Katie Boulter in straight sets at the Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seed dismantled Britain's second-seeded Boulter 6-1, 6-2 in a one-sided final at Victoria Park lasting 71 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old Shnaider, who is ranked 14th in the world, added the Hong Kong crown to titles in Budapest, Bad Homburg in Germany and Hua Hin, Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I did an amazing job," she said, admitting that she will have a target on her back from now on after such a successful 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year everyone will be getting ready, knowing my game."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added: "Even if there are a lot of losses, I'll be as positive as possible, just keep building my game, my mentality, my physical strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of things I can improve and achieve to be, say, a top-10 player. It's not a rush, I'll have to be patient."

 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey on Saturday finished the 100-metre race in 51.56 seconds, just under a second behind American Kate Douglass' 50.82-second performance. Poland's Katarzyna Wasick rounded off the podium with a time of 52.04 seconds.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City suffered their first Premier League loss since December as Bournemouth stunned the champions, while Arsenal were rocked by Newcastle and Liverpool seized top spot on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City were unbeaten in their previous 32 league games, dating back to a defeat at Aston Villa last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola's second-placed side saw that streak come to an unexpected end in a 2-1 loss on England's south coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cherries had never beaten City in their 21 previous meetings, losing 19 of those matches, yet Andoni Iraola's team sprang a huge upset to derail the champions' push for a fifth successive title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth recently damaged Arsenal's title hopes with a 2-0 win at the Vitality Stadium and they inflicted pain on City as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City faced an injury "emergency" after they suffered fitness problems in Wednesday's League Cup defeat at Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhausted or not, City were rocked in the ninth minute when Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo drilled Milos Kerkez's cross past Ederson from inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men were unable to muster a response to that blow and Evanilson doubled Bournemouth's lead in the 64th minute with a composed finish from Kerkez's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josko Gvardiol's header reduced the deficit in the 82nd minute, but it was too late to save City from a second defeat in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of players with no minutes so the balance is a bit uncomfortable. Today we could not handle their intensity. That's why we lost the game," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle put a huge dent in fourth-placed Arsenal's title aspirations with a 1-0 win at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak netted in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and produced just one shot on target in the entire game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team, runners-up to City for the past two years, have taken just one point from their last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we weren't our best version. It's about how you react to that. We're not going to find the right words or answers to describe how we feel," said Arteta, whose side are seven points adrift of first place.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Anfield, Liverpool were in danger of a surprise loss of their own before regrouping to take advantage of their rivals' stumbles with a 2-1 win over Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferdi Kadioglu gave Brighton the lead in the 14th minute with a fierce strike that cannoned in off the post after Danny Welbeck flicked on Kaoru Mitoma's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Liverpool had beaten Brighton in the League Cup last 16 in midweek and they repeated the trick thanks to a late revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo bagged the equaliser in the 69th minute with a cross that looped straight into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead, the Egypt forward curling a fine finish into the top corner for his ninth goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Arne Slot's first season in charge, Liverpool are two points clear of City after their eighth win in 10 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than the position we are in, if you face a team like this and are 1-0 down and can come back to a 2-1 win that gives me a lot of confidence," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest are up to third place after beating 10-man West Ham 3-0 to make it three consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood grabbed his eighth goal in 10 league games in the 27th minute and West Ham had Edson Alvarez sent off in first-half stoppage-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Callum Hudson-Odoi struck in the 65th minute and Ola Aina sealed the points 12 minutes from full-time at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Ayew's stoppage-time equaliser denied third-bottom Ipswich their first top-flight win since 2002 as Leicester rescued a 1-1 draw at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leif Davis' 55th-minute volley put Ipswich ahead but the hosts had Kalvin Phillips sent off in the 77th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-bottom Southampton earned their first league win this season as Adam Armstrong's 85th minute strike sealed a 1-0 success against Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winless Wolves remain bottom of the table after Marc Guehi's 77th minute equaliser earned Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw at Molineux. (AFP)

<img alt="Spaniard Jorge Martin and his team celebrate after he won Saturday's sprint race in Malaysia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777334_1_20241102191043.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jorge Martin took a major step towards his first MotoGP world title as he won the sprint race in Malaysia on Saturday and rival Francesco Bagnaia crashed out.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Martin extended his championship lead to 29 points from 17, with just the grand prix on Sunday at Sepang and one more race weekend to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a bitter blow for Italian two-time reigning champion Bagnaia, who started on pole but came off his Ducati early on to gift a big advantage to Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pramac Ducati's Martin romped home nearly a second ahead of six-time world champion Marc Marquez and can seal the title on Sunday if he earns nine more points than Bagnaia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year I wasn't ready to win," said the 26-year-old Martin, who came second in the title race behind his rival last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season I am more mature. It is a privilege to be here at this point with this advantage, but nothing is over till it's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain fell at a sweltering Sepang five minutes before the start of the 10-lap sprint, adding to the tension on the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia started on pole with Martin alongside him on the front row, only for the Spaniard to seize the lead at the first corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  With eight laps to go and pushing hard, Bagnaia lost control of his Ducati at turn nine and slid out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was unhurt but had his head in his hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I entered the corner a bit slower but I touched the back on the apex of the corner and I lost the front," said the 27-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something that can happen, but all the risk I was taking to fight back with Jorge wasn't over the limit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia dominated Friday's practice and clocked a track record to grab pole for the sprint and the grand prix on Sunday, when 25 points are up for grabs for the winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Pecco will risk a lot tomorrow to win," Martin said of the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to beat him in these conditions is really tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has nothing to lose now. It's all or nothing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The season finale had been scheduled for Valencia in a fortnight but it was cancelled on Friday after deadly flooding in that part of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers are rushing to find a replacement venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  A minute's silence was held in Sepang before the sprint race to remember the more than 200 dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now all my prayers are for Valencia and people at home," said Martin. (AFP)
