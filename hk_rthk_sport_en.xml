<div class="itemFullText">
 Cycling great Mark Cavendish announced his retirement from the sport on Saturday, writing on social media that his final race will be Sunday's Tour de France Singapore Criterium.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Sunday will be the final race of my professional cycling career," wrote the 39-year-old British rider, the record stage winner on the Tour de France with 35, in a post on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cycling has given me so much and I love the sport. I've always wanted to make a difference in it and now I am ready to see what the next chapter has in store for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish made Tour de France history last July when he eclipsed Eddy Merckx's record which had stood since 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am lucky enough to have done what I love for almost 20 years and I can now say that I have achieved everything that I can on the bike," the rider from the Isle of Man said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavendish won the world road race title in 2011 and an omnium silver medal at the 2016 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over two decades he won 165 races, including 17 stages in the Giro d'Italia and three in the Vuelta a Espana. (AFP)

    Japan's Sasaki set to follow Ohtani with move to MLB

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hotly tipped Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki was on Saturday given the green light to follow in the footsteps of Shohei Ohtani and move to Major League Baseball.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki, widely regarded as one of the best players in Japan's domestic league, will be posted for a potential move to the US, his club the Chiba Lotte Marines said.
  <br>
  <br>
  That means MLB clubs will have the right to bid for the 23-year-old right-hander this offseason, in an agreement between the Japanese and American leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki threw a perfect game in April 2022 and was part of the Japan team that won last year's World Baseball Classic alongside Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani won his first MLB championship last month when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki said he had "nothing but gratitude" to the Marines for agreeing to post him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You only get one baseball career and I don't want to have any regrets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to meet the expectations of everyone who has pushed me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sasaki's father and grandparents were killed in the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  His house was swept away when the earthquake unleashed a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing, and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant. (AFP)

<img alt="Donovan Mitchell and the Cleveland Cavaliers maintain their perfect start to the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778284_1_20241109122355.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers continued their perfect start to the NBA season in sensational style on Friday, seizing a 41-point halftime lead on the way to a 136-117 rout of the Golden State Warriors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs improved to 10-0, ending the Warriors' five-game winning streak and handing them their first road defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The damage was done early, the Cavs' 83 first-half points tying a franchise record for most scored in any half and their 41-point halftime lead the biggest in team history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against the Warriors' second-ranked defense, the Cavs posted their fifth game of the young season with at least 130 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  That ties a team record for the most 130-plus point games for an entire season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ten-0 is a magic number," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. "We're playing really good basketball and I'm just really pleased where the group is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was worried about tonight - they're 7-1 and rolling and they're coming in here, they're champions and they're going to try and knock our block off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 27 points, Evan Mobley added 23 and Ty Jerome chipped in 20 off the bench as six Cavs players scored in double figures against a Warriors defense that came in ranked second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, they kept the potentially explosive Warriors offense in check, opening the game on a 20-2 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way we came out tonight, that surprised me, how ready we were, how hungry we were," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Wiggins with nine points and Stephen Curry with seven were the only Warriors starters to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State were able to adjust after the break, out-scoring the Cavs 41-29 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors, however, were in too deep a hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Kuminga led Golden State with 21 points off the bench, Curry finished with 12 on five-of-10 shooting, making just one from three-point range. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ineos Britannia has been accepted as the Challenger of Record for the next edition of the America's Cup sailing competition, organisers announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory against their British opponents on October 19 and the challenge was lodged immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron (RNZYS) and Emirates Team New Zealand are pleased to confirm that the RNZYS has accepted a Notice of Challenge for the 38th America's Cup (AC38) from the Royal Yacht Squadron Limited, represented by Ineos Britannia, which will act as the Challenger of Record for AC38," said a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emirates Team New Zealand CEO Grant Dalton said: "The 38th America's Cup effectively started the moment the team crossed the finish line in Barcelona on 19th October.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very exciting to have continuity with the Challenger of Record, Ineos Britannia, to continue to build the scale of the America's Cup globally."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AC38 would be a "multi-challenger event." At this year's America's Cup, Ineos Britannia won a qualifying event that enabled them to take on the defending champions for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Royal Yacht Squadron said it would "work alongside The Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron" to deliver the protocol for the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The class of yacht will be the AC75 and teams will be restricted to building one boat.
  <br>
  <br>
  No date has yet been set but the statement from the organisers said it is "intended that the AC38 match be held within three years of the completion of the AC37 match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Team New Zealand won the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time to end the best-of-13 series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The British boat was skippered by four-time Olympic gold medallist Ben Ainslie and is bankrolled by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of petrochemical group Ineos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ainslie said he would keep going until he won Britain the trophy, but did not know if that would still be as a sailor or in a different position. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong will participate in organising the cross-border events of the National Games, including marathon and road cycling competitions, organisers said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  To be held next year from November 9 to 21, it will be the first time for the National Games to be co-hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event’s coordination office head Yeung Tak-keung told a countdown press conference that apart from hosting eight competitions, the SAR will also help organise the athletics marathon hosted by Shenzhen, and road cycling hosted by Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao Chao, the publicity department director for the General Administration of Sport of China, said Guangzhou and Shenzhen have finished planning for the games’ opening and closing ceremonies, and that authorities are planning out the route for the torch relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong sports bureau director Cui Jian, meanwhile, said renovation and construction of venues in the province will be completed in March of next year.

    F1 takes on FIA chief in open letter amid swearing row

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One drivers on Thursday blasted the "tone and language" used by FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem amid a row over swearing at press conferences.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an open letter, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) also demanded that competitors be treated like adults.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several drivers, including three-time world champion Max Verstappen of the Netherlands and Monaco's Charles Leclerc, were recently sanctioned by the FIA for swearing at a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Ben Sulayem has spoken out in favour of measures to ensure drivers no longer use foul language.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the GPDA hit back with a letter posted on social media regarding 'Driver Misconduct'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a difference between swearing intended to insult others and more casual swearing, such as you might use to describe bad weather, or indeed an inanimate object such as an F1 car, or a driving situation," the letter read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the FIA president to consider his own tone and language when talking to our member drivers, or indeed about them, whether in a public forum or otherwise," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further, our members are adults," it went on to say. "They do not need to be given instructions via the media, about matters as trivial as the wearing of jewellery or underpants."
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton has clashed with FIA bosses for wearing jewellery at races, with the governing body also reminding drivers of the need to wear flame-resistant underwear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GPDA also stressed its opposition to financial sanctions against drivers and called on Ben Sulayem to clarify how they are imposed and how their proceeds are used.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relations between Ben Sulayem, team bosses and drivers have deteriorated in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FIA president was accused at the start of the year of trying to derail the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix and influence the results of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix the same year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In both cases, the Emirati was cleared by the FIA Ethics Committee. (AFP)

    World number two Swiatek crashes out of WTA Finals

<img alt="The world number two needed a victory from Gauff to advance to the last four. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778086_1_20241108080912.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the WTA Finals on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova defeated Coco Gauff to secure her spot in the semi-finals at the expense of the Pole.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Wimbledon champion claimed a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Gauff to end the title defence of Swiatek, who needed Krejcikova to lose in order to progress from the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  With one win and one loss under her belt entering the last day of round-robin play, Swiatek's 6-1, 6-0 victory over alternate Daria Kasatkina did not have any bearing on her qualification chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only scenario that would have led to Swiatek's advancement to the semi-finals would have been a Gauff win over Krejcikova.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result did not materialise though, and Krejcikova punched her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals for the first time – on her second singles appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova moves forward as the winner of the Orange Group, and will face Zheng Qinwen in Friday's last-four stage, with Gauff of the United States advancing as the runner-up to set up a semi-final showdown with world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Definitely this is a big win for me. I'm really happy with how I played and with my performance today. It was a really big match," said Krejcikova, who saved a remarkable 11 of 12 break points against Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Playing tomorrow again is something unimaginable before this tournament and I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just fighting for every ball, and I knew it's going to be difficult because I know Coco is on a roll and she's one of the best players this season," she added. "That was a huge challenge but also the big prize, the semis was on the table – I am super excited to be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff saved two match points in a 10-minute final game and had three opportunities to break Krejcikova but the eighth seed would not fold, and she scooped the victory with a service winner after one hour and 42 minutes of play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Krejcikova, who has won just 21 matches this season, earned her place in the WTA Finals field due to a new rule introduced by the Tour in 2024, which gives priority to a reigning Grand Slam champion over the eighth-ranked player in the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Wimbledon champion, Krejcikova grabbed the last spot in Riyadh over world number eight Emma Navarro, who chose not to come to Saudi Arabia as an alternate. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé has been left out of the France squad for their upcoming Uefa Nations League matches against Israel and Italy, with coach Didier Deschamps insisting the absence of the Real Madrid superstar "is for the best".
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the second successive France squad from which the national team captain has been absent after he also missed the October double-header against Israel and Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have spoken with him and I have made the decision for this get-together because I think it is for the best," Deschamps told reporters at a press conference in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Mbappé was rested for last month's matches in order to help him recover from a minor thigh injury suffered playing for Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that quickly became a source of controversy when he returned to action for Real days later, before France had even played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé was absent for France's 4-1 win over Israel in a game played in Budapest and a 2-1 win in Belgium, and instead travelled to Stockholm for a short break with members of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was following that trip that Swedish media reported he was being investigated for an alleged rape. Mbappé himself said those reports were "fake news", while his lawyer said the player would take action for libel.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Swedish prosecutor confirmed that an investigation had been opened, without naming Mbappe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am not going to set out my argument, but I can say two things. The first is that Kylian wanted to come," Deschamps added. "The second is that it is not to do with the off-field problems because the presumption of innocence exists."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since last month's controversy, the ex-Paris Saint-Germain forward has made four appearances for his club, scoring one goal. However, he remains short of his explosive best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to say any more about it. I stand by my decision," Deschamps added.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are second in Group A2 of the Nations League, one point behind leaders Italy, ahead of their final two fixtures.
  <br>
  <br>
  They host Israel at the Stade de France next Thursday, November 14, and then play Italy in Milan three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  France are five points clear of Belgium in third place and the top two teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, which will take place over two legs next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will be played next June.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran midfielder N'Golo Kante, of Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia, returns to the squad along with Adrien Rabiot of Marseille.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, there is a first call-up for highly-rated Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who takes the place of West Ham United's Alphonse Areola in the squad. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of the cross-harbour swim scheduled for Sunday said the race will be cancelled in the event of a tropical cyclone warning signal.
 <br>
  <br>
  They said the annual swim will be called off if the Standby Signal No 1 or above, or the red or black rainstorm warning, is in force at 6am that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will also be cancelled if there's a red tide at the harbour, or any other condition that deems the race unsuitable to take place.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said it will issue the Standby Signal No 1 between noon and 3pm on Friday as Super Typhoon Yinxing enters within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong, and according to its current forecast track, the storm will be within 400 kilometres of the SAR from Saturday until Sunday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers of the cross-harbour swim called on all participants to pay attention to the latest situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the race is cancelled, an official announcement will be made shortly on [our] official website and on [our] social media channels," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 4,000 swimmers have signed up for the event due to take place on Sunday morning. They'll make their way from Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui.

    Raygun retires from breaking, citing Olympic backlash

<img alt="Australia's Rachael Gunn competing against France's Sya Dembele in the Paris Olympics. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777941_1_20241107112433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn has announced her retirement from competition, citing "really upsetting" backlash following her performance at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Raygun's unorthodox routine – including kangaroo hops and imitating a sprinkler – failed to impress the judges at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her moves were copied on late-night talk shows and her unfashionable green tracksuit was mercilessly parodied online.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conspiracy theories abounded to explain how the university lecturer had even made it on to the Australia Olympic team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn said the intense scrutiny had been "really upsetting", and she had decided to pull the plug on her breakdancing career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not going to compete any more," she told Australian radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. "I was going to keep competing for sure, but that seems like a really difficult thing for me to do now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level of scrutiny that's going to be there," she added. "People will be filming it, it will be going online, it's just not going to be the same experience."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunn had previously spoken out against the "pretty devastating" hatred unleashed towards her after the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went out there and I had fun – I did take it very seriously. I worked my butt off preparing for the Olympics, and I gave my all," she said in a video message after the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  While many lampooned her performance on social media, Gunn won support from others, including her fellow Australian Olympians and even the country's prime minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun said she would continue to dance, just not in competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that's like in my living room with my partner," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don't think people should feel bad about the way that they dance," she added. "If you get out there, and you have fun on the dance floor – then just own it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raygun did have the last laugh in September when she was briefly elevated to the top of the World Dance Sport Federation rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WDSF named her the number one women's breakdancer based on winning the Oceania Championship, one of only a few events held that counted towards the rankings in the run-up to the Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport of breaking made its Olympics debut in Paris, but will not feature at the next Games at Los Angeles in 2028. (AFP)

    Inter Milan sink Arsenal in Champions League

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hakan Calhanoglu penalty gave Inter Milan a 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, as the Italian champions remain undefeated in the competition this season and sit fifth on ten points at the midway point of the new league phase format.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I think we played a great game against a strong side who play with great intensity," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, on the other hand, experienced defeat for the first time in Europe this season and lie three points and seven places behind their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match at the San Siro looked set to go into the break goalless until a penalty was signalled against Mikel Merino after Mehdi Taremi's flick deviated the ball into the Arsenal player's raised hand from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were very harshly done by," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "There is no deflection, nothing you can do in the box – so can he get away from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Calhanoglu stroked home the resulting spot-kick three minutes into first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yann Sommer and Denzel Dumfries combined on the line to deny Gabriel Magalhaes a leveller shortly before the hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal cranked up the pressure in the second half but were unable to break down Inter's solid defensive block as the Premier League side fell to a second defeat in four days. (AFP)

    Zheng into last four of WTA Finals, Sabalenka loses

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen continued to deliver in her breakthrough season as she advanced to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Wednesday with victory over Jasmine Paolini, while Elena Rybakina beat the already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka.
 <br>
  <br>
  Picking up a 30th win from her last 35 matches, Chinese Olympic gold medallist Zheng swept past the fourth-seeded Italian 6-1, 6-1 in a mere 67 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Rybakina claimed a consolation 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number one Sabalenka, who had already secured her semi-final spot as the group winner on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eliminated from the competition after losing her opening two matches, Rybakina found her form against Sabalenka – a much-needed confidence boost for the world number five after missing the majority of the second half of the season with allergies, insomnia and a back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a tough match and I'm really happy that I managed to win. I think it's nice to finish the year at least with one win against the world number one," said Rybakina, who shared a warm embrace with Sabalenka at the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the second loss Sabalenka has suffered in her last 24 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, 26, must wait to find out who she will face in Friday's semi-finals, but has reason to celebrate despite defeat as she clinched the year-end number one ranking as a result of Iga Swiatek's defeat to Coco Gauff on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Belarusian said she will not let her new ranking distract her from the task at hand – lifting the WTA Finals trophy for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a really great feeling but I figured that last night and it didn't work really well tonight for me so I just want to focus on the current tournament to stay hungry and stay motivated – it's a big tournament and it's also one of my goals, so I'll focus on this goal," Sabalenka said Wednesday.

    Atlético stun PSG in Champions League clash

<img alt="Correa celebrates after scoring the late winner for Atlético. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777905_1_20241107074910.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Substitute Ángel Correa scored a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Atlético Madrid snatched a 2-1 victory away to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, kickstarting their Uefa Champions League campaign and casting a large cloud over the French club's European hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  It looked as if the game at the Parc des Princes would end in a draw after Warren Zaire-Emery's early opener for PSG was quickly cancelled out by Nahuel Molina, in what was the first ever meeting of the clubs.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG have been let down by their finishing in the Champions League all season and that was the case again here as they failed to convert a host of chances, but Atletico did not look like winning it until Correa struck in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniards would have been the happier of the two teams with a draw, especially as goalkeeper Jan Oblak had been forced into several second-half saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost back-to-back matches against Benfica and Lille, the win puts Atlético back on track to at least make the play-off round of this new-look Champions League, with the league phase now at the halfway stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The evening was also notable for the pre-match unfurling by PSG fans at one end of the stadium of an enormous banner in support of Palestinians in Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  "War on the pitch but peace in the world," said the banner, which also featured a Lebanese flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  That may lead to disciplinary action from Uefa, but that will probably be the least of PSG's worries right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  They may be comfortably on top of Ligue 1 but in the Champions League last season's semi-finalists have just four points, despite playing three of their four games so far at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having edged Girona 1-0 on the opening matchday and then lost 2-0 away to Arsenal, the French champions have since drawn at home to PSV Eindhoven and now lost to Atlético.
  <br>
  <br>
  They face a tough assignment next away to Bayern Munich and also still have to play Manchester City, meaning their hopes of finishing in the top 24 places and qualifying at least for the play-off round must be in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique's side will need to quickly improve in front of goal having now scored just three times in their last six Champions League matches, a run stretching back to last season's semi-final loss against Borussia Dortmund. (AFP)

    Gauff beats Swiatek, Sabalenka earns world number one

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coco Gauff posted a rare victory over Iga Swiatek to punch her ticket to the semi-finals of the WTA Finals in Riyadh on Tuesday, ensuring Aryna Sabalenka will finish the year as the world number one.
 <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, the defending champion, was in a direct battle with Sabalenka for the top spot this week but needed a win over Gauff to keep her chances alive of leapfrogging her Belarusian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, 20, entered the contest having lost 11 of her 12 previous meetings with Swiatek, with the American's sole victory coming in Cincinnati last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she turned the tables on Swiatek on Tuesday, defeating the second seed 6-3, 6-4 to make it two straight-sets wins from two round-robin matches in Riyadh this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels great. I knew going into the match that despite our head-to-head I had a lot of confidence going in," said Gauff, who hit 11 double faults during the one-hour 48-minute showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the exception of the opening game of the match, Gauff had break point opportunities in every Swiatek service game in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American third seed made her move in game seven, breaking for 4-3, and she closed out the set with a second break of serve, taking the lead in 49 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek needed six break points in a marathon third game of the second set to finally take down the Gauff serve but she couldn't consolidate her advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  They traded breaks again, as Gauff's double-fault tally went up to double digits and Swiatek racked up the errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Gauff who eventually steadied the ship, and wrapped up the victory on Swiatek's 47th unforced error of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, a five-time major champion, admits her two-month break between the US Open and the WTA Finals and the fact she is playing her first tournament with her new coach Wim Fissette have made things "a bit more tricky and different than usual".
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'll force myself to work even better in the next match," the Pole added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Champions League holders Real Madrid fell to a 3-1 home defeat by AC Milan on Tuesday in the group stage with striker Kylian Mbappé unable to find the net again.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old France captain has scored once in his last six matches for Madrid across all competitions, including three losses for Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malick Thiaw headed the Italian side ahead before Vinicius Junior levelled from the penalty spot for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvaro Morata struck against his former side to restore Milan's lead before the break and Tijjani Reijnders netted the third to secure Milan's victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were unable to bounce back strongly from the 4-0 thrashing by Barcelona in late October, their last outing after Saturday's La Liga match at Valencia was postponed because of devastating floods in the east of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players from both sides wore t-shirts before the match reading "We are all Valencia" while in one stand a giant Valencia regional flag was unfurled for a minute's silence.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 90 minutes that followed, Paulo Fonseca's Milan, seventh in Serie A, outclassed Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going through a period when our opponents are punishing us a lot and we have to keep working so that this doesn't happen again," Madrid defender Lucas Vazquez told Movistar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos have let in nine goals in their last three home matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to be worried, the team's not giving a good account of itself," said Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The team is not compact, we have to be more compact, more organised, we've let in a lot of goals," he added. "We're not well organised on the pitch, and we have to work on that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Milan have won the competition seven times, behind only record 15-time champions Madrid, but have not reached a final since 2007, when Ancelotti led them to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  This victory harked back to their glory days and Fonseca praised his team's bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players came here with courage, didn't have any fear – in the first half we created plenty, and in the second half we were on the back foot, but we fought together," said the Portuguese coach. "We definitely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti, who won the Champions League twice as a player and then twice as a coach with Milan, only made one change from the Clasico humiliation, bringing in Luka Modric for Eduardo Camavinga. (AFP)

    Injured Djokovic withdraws from ATP Finals

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic said on Tuesday he will not defend his ATP Finals title due to an "ongoing injury" which has ended the 24-time Grand Slam champion's season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tennis icon Djokovic was one of four players still battling for one of three remaining places at the season-ending event in Turin, which kicks off on Sunday, but said on social media that he wouldn't be making a bid for a third straight Finals title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really looking forward to being there, but due to ongoing injury I won't be playing next week," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Apologies to those who were planning to see me," the statement added. "Wishing all the players a great tournament. See you soon!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb, currently ranked fifth in the world, sits sixth in "The Race", the ATP's annual rankings to determine the eight competitors at the Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Carlos Alcaraz, Daniil Medvedev and Taylor Fritz had already qualified before Djokovic's announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  His retirement from the tournament automatically opens up the final three places to Casper Ruud, Alex de Minaur and Andrey Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruud and Rublev are playing in Metz, France this week, with De Minaur in action in Belgrade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic's withdrawal was not a surprise as he had already pulled out of the Paris Masters, effectively ending what has been a difficult season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't won a single ATP title in 2024, the first time that has happened since 2006, and has been shoved aside by young stars Sinner and Alcaraz at the top of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic did, however, win singles gold at the Paris Olympics, adding the final major honour which was missing from his record-breaking list of career achievements. (AFP)

    Amorim's Sporting stun Man City in Champions League

<img alt="Amorim is celebrated by his players at the end of his final home game with Sporting. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777733_1_20241106075002.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Viktor Gyokeres's hat-trick fired Sporting Lisbon to a stunning 4-1 rout of Manchester City in the Uefa Champions League as Ruben Amorim showed why Manchester United were so keen to lure him to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sporting manager Amorim accepted United's offer to replace Erik ten Hag,  and will officially take charge of the troubled Premier League club on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarded as one of Europe's brightest young managerial minds, the 39-year-old delivered a tantalising glimpse of his acumen as Sporting exposed injury-hit City's defensive weaknesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden put City ahead in the opening moments at the Jose Alvalade stadium, but the visitors wasted a string of chances to increase their lead and Sporting made them pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gyokeres equalised before half-time and Maximiliano Araujo bagged Sporting's second after the break before Gyokeres's penalty capped their incredible fightback with two penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland squandered a chance to give City a second half lifeline when his penalty hit the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said United fans might think "the new Alex Ferguson has arrived" if his team beat City.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the turbulent end to Ten Hag's reign – he was sacked in October with United languishing in the bottom half of the table – Amorim clearly faces a huge task to restore the club to the glory they enjoyed in the Ferguson era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comparisons with United's legendary former boss should be shelved for now, but Sporting's spirited victory will have fans counting down the days until his arrival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, who led Sporting to two Portuguese titles in four years, is set to take charge of his first United game at Ipswich on November 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola will get his chance for revenge in Amorim's first Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola has plenty to work on before then as he looks for solutions to City's unexpected three-game losing streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a fantastic first half, now we are struggling to score. We create and concede when the opponents don't do much," Guardiola said. "At 2-1 down, many things can happen. Emotionally, we were not stable enough – and in this competition, you have to be stable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City suffered a first top-flight defeat of the season against Bournemouth on Saturday, three days after losing to Tottenham in the League Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the absences of Rodri, Jack Grealish, Ruben Dias, John Stones and Oscar Bobb, City have lost their momentum in dramatic fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their first defeat in four games in this season's Champions League shouldn't be fatal to their European ambitions, but Guardiola will be desperate for a positive reaction at Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's heaviest defeat since 2020 meant, for only the second time in the Guardiola era, they had suffered three consecutive losses in a single season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting, meanwhile, have 10 points from four Champions League games as Amorim leaves them in rude health. (AFP)

<img alt="The Rugby Sevens in March will be held at the Kai Tak Stadium for the first time. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777647_1_20241105162129.jpg&q=25">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for the upcoming Hong Kong Rugby Sevens – the first to be held at the Kai Tak Stadium – went on sale on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament, scheduled for March 28 to 30, will be among the first major sporting events held at the 50,000-seat stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said three-day passes for the tournament – which took place at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades – are priced at HK$1,950 for adults, and HK$950 for children 12 and under.
  <br>
  <br>
  A small amount of single-day tickets are also available via online ticket-seller, Klook, priced at up to HK$1,200.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organisers Hong Kong China Rugby said prices are frozen at 2019 levels and that a HK$750 pass will grant priority access to the new South Stand and cover a free flow of drinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We hope] the opportunity to be at one of the first events at the stadium, as well as the increased stadium capacity of the venue, will draw thousands of new fans to experience Hong Kong’s biggest party in the city’s biggest stadium," organisers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for last year’s sevens were sold out for the first time since the end of the pandemic.

    Rank outsider Knight's Choice wins the Melbourne Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rank outsider Knight's Choice upset favourite Buckaroo on Tuesday to win the A$8 million (US$5.25 million) Melbourne Cup, earning Irish jockey Robbie Dolan a debut victory in Australia's "race that stops a nation".
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-year-old Australian-bred gelding came home by a nose in a photo finish ahead of Japanese raider Warp Speed and the Jamie Kah-ridden Okita Soushi in the energy-sapping two-mile handicap at Flemington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pinch me, I'm dreaming," said 28-year-old Dolan, a part-time singer who was riding in the famous race for the first time. "It is incredible. I can't believe it. I don't even know what to say."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't know what to expect, but I feel like I've ridden it 10 times because I have ridden it in my head 100 times," he added. "I can't put it into words – it's the biggest race in the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a huge breakthrough for Dolan, who was previously best-known for appearing on The Voice, an Australian singing show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be singing tonight after a few beers," he said, overcome with emotion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buckaroo, priced as the A$7.00 favourite, finished ninth while the fancied Vauban could only manage 11th on a warm and sunny day, with the track firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  A cultural institution in Australia, the Melbourne Cup has been run since 1861 and is considered so important it is a public holiday in its host state of Victoria.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held in front of a bumper crowd, drinking and socialising took priority over racing for many, with the sound of popping champagne corks accompanying the thundering of hooves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Breaking from barrier six, the John Symons and Sheila Laxon-trained Knight's Choice, an 80-1 shot, settled towards the back of the 23-strong pack behind early leader Just Fine.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 1,000m to go, Just Fine was still ahead but was slowly reeled in down the home straight and finished last, with Knight's Choice surging from 20th at the final turn for a thrilling victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a second win for Laxon, who became the first woman to train a Melbourne Cup winner in 2001 with Ethereal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He did, he did," she said, lavishing praise on Dolan. "We didn't give him instructions, he knew what to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Symons added: "I was worried. He got further back than we talked about, but great ride. What a thrill. What a thrill."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mark Zahra, who rode the last two Melbourne Cup winners – Without a Fight and Gold Trip – was denied a hat-trick aboard Circle of Fire, finishing sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Kerrin McEvoy's bid for a record-equalling fourth win was also unsuccessful, with his horse Absurde fifth. A record four women jockeys took part with Kah faring best on Okita Soushi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michelle Payne is the only woman rider to win the Melbourne Cup after she steered Prince of Penzance to victory in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one withdrawal by stewards before the race started with French import Athabascan found to have an irregular heartbeat, reducing the field to 23. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Wilson struck twice in stoppage time to give Fulham a dramatic 2-1 victory over west London rivals Brentford on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vitaly Janelt had blasted the Bees in front against the run of play midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham were frustrated until added time when substitute Wilson flicked home the equaliser and then head in a winner at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an amazing feeling to come on and get the two goals to win the game. We deserved it, we kept them pinned in throughout," said Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Marco Silva's men up to ninth and just three points off the top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had been headed for the top half themselves until the late turnaround, but instead remain in 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham failed to make the most of a purposeful start as Reiss Nelson was denied by Mark Flekken.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had barely threatened prior to going in front on 24 minutes when Janelt took aim from distance and fired a blistering shot past Bernd Leno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emile Smith Rowe wasted a big chance to reply immediately and the home side struggled to break through Brentford's mass ranks of defence after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took until Fulham's 25th attempt on goal to beat Flekken, as Wilson's inventive effort looped over the Dutch goalkeeper from Adama Traore's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, the Welsh international had a fortuitous second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wilson's attempted header came off his shoulder to wrong-foot Flekken and flew into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They both went in, but not how I would have wanted" Wilson added. "The first one I just helped it on to the back post, and the second one was more lucky." (AFP)

<img alt="Clevand's Darius Garland celebrates in the second half against the Milwaukee Bucks. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777618_1_20241105115319.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland poured in 39 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers fended off a late Milwaukee surge to beat the Bucks 116-114 on Monday and push their perfect NBA record to 8-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Garland drilled a step-back three-pointer to put Cleveland up 113-111 with 45 seconds to play, then fed Jarrett Allen for a dagger layup as the Cavs, who led by as many as 19 in the second quarter, matched the franchise's best start to a season – also achieved in 1976.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard to get one win, so eight is crazy," Garland said. "I'm happy we got eight – we've got to keep this thing going."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, with two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo sitting out with an adductor strain, dropped their sixth straight game – coming up short again after a one-point home loss to the Cavs on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee point guard Damian Lillard scored 14 of his 36 points in the third quarter as the Bucks battled back to lead 91-89 heading into the fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  They pushed the lead to eight points midway through the fourth, but a three-pointer from Garland ignited a 10-0 scoring run that put the Cavs up by two. Lillard would briefly put Milwaukee back in front but the Cavs had enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 17 points and Allen finished with 14 points, 15 rebounds and a massive block on Lillard with eight seconds to play that sealed the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had to fight for 48 minutes," Garland said. "We knew they were going to come out in the second half and try to be more aggressive – it was a great all-around team effort."

  <br>
  On a busy night that saw every team in action before a pause for the US presidential election on Tuesday, the Detroit Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers 115-103 while the reigning champion Boston Celtics romped past the Hawks 123-93 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Golden State Warriors welcomed Stephen Curry back from a three-game injury absence with a 125-112 victory over the Wizards in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, Cade Cunningham scored 17 points with 11 rebounds and 11 assists for the third triple-double of his career and Jaden Ivey scored 26 points to power the Pistons to their third win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 37 points for the Lakers, but appeared to be troubled by a left foot or ankle injury in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James scored 20 points with eight rebounds and 11 assists, but the Pistons seized the lead in the first quarter and remained in control the rest of the way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors led all the way in Washington, with Curry scoring a team-high 24 points in his first game since he tweaked his left ankle on October 27. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Nelly Korda has clinched her first LPGA Player of the Year honours, the LPGA confirmed on Monday after it became mathematically impossible for anyone to catch her for the points-based award.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an already historic 2024 campaign America's Korda has six victories and three additional top-10 finishes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her wins included a record-equalling run of five straight capped by her second major title at the Chevron Championship, and she represented the United States at the Paris Olympics and in the Solheim Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda skipped two tournaments on the recent Asian swing after a neck injury limited her ability to practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ayaka Furue of Japan, winner of the Evian Championship in July, would have had to win the rest of the LPGA events this year to catch up, but tied for 10th in the Japan Classic on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Winning the Rolex Player of the Year means so much to me," the 26-year-old Korda said in a statement. "This season has had its highs and challenges, and I'm just really grateful for the people around me who have helped me get here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda is expected to tee it up in two more tournaments this year, including the season-ending Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, from November 21 to 24. (AFP)

    Olympic champion Lyles misses out track athlete award

<img alt="Lyles on the podium after the men's 200-metre athletics event at Paris 2024. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777595_1_20241105095925.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic 100-metre champion Noah Lyles is not one of the two finalists for male track athlete of the year, World Athletics revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lyles won one of the closest Olympic finals in history to take gold in Paris in August by five thousandths of a second from Kishane Thompson of Jamaica.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lyles misses out as 200-metre Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana and Norway's 5,000-metre gold medallist Jakob Ingebrigtsen were the two male track athletes to make the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was aiming for an Olympic sprint double but had to settle for the 200m bronze medal behind Tebogo and his US teammate Kenny Bednarek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyles later revealed he had raced in the 200-metre despite testing positive for Covid-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the winner of the Olympic women's 100-metre final, Julien Alfred of St. Lucia, is one of the two women's track finalists.
  <br>
  <br>
  She will be up against Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the American who broke her own world record to win the Olympic 400-metre hurdles title for a second time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics said the top two in each category – track, field and out of stadium – were chosen from a first round of voting, which comprised votes from the World Athletics Council, officials and dignitaries connected to the sport known as the "World Athletics Family", and a public vote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a new addition to this year's awards, a final round of votes cast by fans of the sport from Monday until November 10 will decide the overall World Athlete of the Year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the field events, Olympic men's pole vault champion and world record holder Mondo Duplantis will be hot favourite to take the men's award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede is up against Miltiadis Tentoglou of Greece, who won the men's long jump gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukrainian high jumper Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who broke the 37-year-old women's world record with a clearance of 2.10-metre four weeks before taking Olympic gold, will go head-to-head with three-time Olympic heptathlon champion Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's out-of-stadium award pits world marathon record holder Ruth Chepng'etich of Kenya against Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won the Olympic marathon in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's category Brian Pintado, the Ecuadorean gold medallist in the 20-kilometre race walk at the Paris Games, will compete against Olympic men's marathon champion Tamirat Tola from Ethiopia. (AFP)

    Sabalenka through to WTA Finals semis, Zheng cruises

<img alt="Sabalenka during her group-stage match against Paolini. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777575_1_20241105081016.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka has secured qualification for the semi-finals stage of the WTA Finals with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Jasmine Paolini, as Zheng Qinwen ended Elena Rybakina's chances of moving on in Riyadh on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With two round-robin wins in as many matches this week in Saudi Arabia, Sabalenka guaranteed herself passage to the final four as the winner of the Purple Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belarusian top seed is also just one victory away from locking down the year-end number one ranking, which she is in a direct battle with Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka bounced back from 0-2 down in the second set, and saved two set points at 4-5 to overcome Italian fourth seed Paolini and has now won 22 of her last 23 matches on tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second set was quite tricky. Honestly, I just tried to stay aggressive and show her that I'm going to fight for this set no matter what and I'm really happy I was able to win in straight sets," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Halfway through the second set I was already thinking about the third set," she added. "But I was like, wait, wait, it's not the third set until it's the third set – I'm happy all those shots on set points went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chinese Olympic medallist improved her chances of advancing to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 6-1 victory over world number five Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Zheng rebounded from her opening round-robin defeat to Sabalenka by claiming her first win from three meetings with Rybakina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina suffered her second defeat of the week in Saudi Arabia, and has no chance of reaching the semi-finals – with one more round-robin clash to go against Sabalenka on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng apologised to the crowd during her on-court interview for yelling, 'Don't shout more', at some of her supporters at a crucial moment in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She thanked them for their support and later acknowledged she could have handled the moment better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt today in such an important moment, when they shout so hard my name, my heart rate goes up. So I hold and hold, until one moment I can't hold more," Zheng said during her post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm feeling a bit bad, because if I can control my emotions a bit better, I was supposed not to say that to my crowd."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng arrived in Riyadh on the back of an impressive second half of the season that saw her win titles in Palermo and Tokyo, and an Olympic gold medal in singles in Paris. No woman has won more matches than her within that span.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first Chinese player to qualify for the WTA Finals since Li Na in 2013, Zheng amassed a 12-2 win-loss record during the Asian swing last month and is the tour leader in most aces struck and percentage of first-serve points won.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Olympic champion now owns a tour-leading 20 three-set wins in 2024 – the highest tally by a WTA player in a single season since 2016. (AFP)

    Rams beat Seahawks in overtime thriller, Lions cruise

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tense battle in Seattle saw the Los Angeles Rams come away with a 26-20 overtime NFL win on Demarcus Robinson's one-handed catch of a 39-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matthew Stafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Seahawks had scored on a 14-yard touchdown in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but could not score on the opening drive of the extra session.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Rams needing only a field goal after stuffing the Seahawks on fourth down on the first possession of overtime, Stafford went for the win by throwing a deep ball to Robinson, who was well covered by cornerback Riq Woolen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stafford threw for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception for the Rams, who have now won three straight after losing four of their previous five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions dominated the Green Bay Packers in a 24-14 victory at rain-lashed Lambeau Field on Sunday, winning the battle for supremacy in the NFC North division.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Kerby Joseph returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown to help the Lions take control in the highly anticipated matchup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green Bay struck for an early field goal, but the Lions took the lead for good when quarterback Jared Goff hit Amon-Ra St. Brown with a three-yard touchdown pass in the first minute of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They added a field goal and a touchdown in the final minute of the first half as Joseph reeled in a pass from an under-pressure Packers quarterback Jordan Love and raced up the sideline to the end zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit scored 24 points before the Packers produced a second field goal. A late Green Bay touchdown made the score more respectable, but the Lions were in control throughout as they improved to 7-1 – the best record in the NFC – for the first time since 1956.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a fun game," Goff said. "In Green Bay, in Lambeau, we're supposed to be the 'dome team' – we're supposed to be the team that can't play outside – and we came in here and win." (AFP/AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New Zealand captain Tom Latham on Sunday said his team's 3-0 Test sweep in India was one of the "greatest series wins" for the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Black Caps won the third Test by 25 runs on Sunday at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium to hand India only their second series whitewash at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand – cricket's perennial underdogs – turned around their fortunes from a 2-0 defeat in Sri Lanka in September to make India suffer their first Test series loss at home in 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a great moment for New Zealand cricket, probably one of New Zealand cricket's greatest series wins I think," said Latham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, all we can do is keep playing cricket and keep playing our brand of cricket," he added. "We've felt a lot of support over the last couple of weeks, which is really special."
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand host England for three Tests starting November 28 in Christchurch followed by matches in Wellington and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got three more big games back home," said Latham. "We've got sell-out crowds in a couple of the games – which is all you can ask for from a cricketer's point of view."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mumbai-born New Zealand spinner Ajaz Patel stood out in the final Test with a match-haul of 11 wickets with his left-arm spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  He took five in the first innings and then six to help bowl out India for 121 in their chase of 147 and Latham praised his match-winner as "fantastic". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time world champion Max Verstappen produced a virtuoso drive in often atrocious conditions to regain control of this year's world championship on Sunday when he charged from 17th on the grid to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.
 <br>
  <br>
  Without a win in 10 races since the Spanish Grand Prix in May, Red Bull's series leader made light of the chaotic, rain-swept conditions to register a 62nd career triumph and fastest lap while nearest title rival Lando Norris of McLaren went from pole position to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman's triumph lifted him to 393 points, increasing his advantage over Norris, on 331, to 62 with just three Grands Prix and one sprint race remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen finished 19.477 seconds ahead of Alpine's French duo of Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly with Mercedes' George Russell fourth and Charles Leclerc fifth for Ferrari in a tumultuous contest of accidents, two red-flag stoppages, penalties and planned post-race investigations.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Alpine, the reward was a leap from ninth to sixth in the constructors championship, reportedly valued at an estimated US$50 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris, who struggled to find his usual pace, came home sixth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, RB's Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen's success came on the day he overhauled Michael Schumacher's record of leading the drivers standings for 896 days while many of his rivals faced post-race investigations for various sporting misdemeanours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My emotions have been a rollercoaster today – that unlucky qualifying and starting 17th made it such a tough race, but we stayed out of trouble, made the right calls and it is unbelievable to win here from so far back," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," said a beaming Ocon. "After this difficult season, it's so nice to drive here and the rain levelled out the performance so I am very happy." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Germany's Alexander Zverev won the Paris Masters on Sunday by defeating home hope Ugo Humbert 6-2, 6-2 in a dominant display by the new world number two.
 <br>
  <br>
  Zverev, 27, now boasts seven ATP 1000-level titles over the course of his career, following two wins in Rome and Madrid, as well as victories in Montreal and Cincinnati.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a happy return to Paris for Zverev, after he lost the French Open final in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz in June. Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I had to play like this to win today," said Zverev, who opened his victory speech by apologising to the crowd at Paris' Bercy Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Ugo on an incredible week, he's an incredible player,": he added. "If you continue like this, you'll be able to lift trophies like this. This is not your last chance, Ugo."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev's victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the season-ending showpiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to congratulate Zverev for the quality of the tennis he has played all this week, and season," said Humbert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came as a kid to watch matches at the Paris Masters, and it made me want to do what I do," he added. "So I'm very happy to have reached the final." (AFP)

 Russia's Diana Shnaider won her fourth WTA title of a breakout season on Sunday as she blew away Katie Boulter in straight sets at the Hong Kong Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seed dismantled Britain's second-seeded Boulter 6-1, 6-2 in a one-sided final at Victoria Park lasting 71 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old Shnaider, who is ranked 14th in the world, added the Hong Kong crown to titles in Budapest, Bad Homburg in Germany and Hua Hin, Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year I did an amazing job," she said, admitting that she will have a target on her back from now on after such a successful 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year everyone will be getting ready, knowing my game."
  <br>
  <br>
  She added: "Even if there are a lot of losses, I'll be as positive as possible, just keep building my game, my mentality, my physical strength.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are a lot of things I can improve and achieve to be, say, a top-10 player. It's not a rush, I'll have to be patient."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City suffered their first Premier League loss since December as Bournemouth stunned the champions, while Arsenal were rocked by Newcastle and Liverpool seized top spot on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City were unbeaten in their previous 32 league games, dating back to a defeat at Aston Villa last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola's second-placed side saw that streak come to an unexpected end in a 2-1 loss on England's south coast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cherries had never beaten City in their 21 previous meetings, losing 19 of those matches, yet Andoni Iraola's team sprang a huge upset to derail the champions' push for a fifth successive title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth recently damaged Arsenal's title hopes with a 2-0 win at the Vitality Stadium and they inflicted pain on City as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City faced an injury "emergency" after they suffered fitness problems in Wednesday's League Cup defeat at Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhausted or not, City were rocked in the ninth minute when Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo drilled Milos Kerkez's cross past Ederson from inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men were unable to muster a response to that blow and Evanilson doubled Bournemouth's lead in the 64th minute with a composed finish from Kerkez's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josko Gvardiol's header reduced the deficit in the 82nd minute, but it was too late to save City from a second defeat in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of players with no minutes so the balance is a bit uncomfortable. Today we could not handle their intensity. That's why we lost the game," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle put a huge dent in fourth-placed Arsenal's title aspirations with a 1-0 win at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak netted in the 12th minute, heading home Anthony Gordon's pinpoint cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Arsenal struggled to get out of first gear and produced just one shot on target in the entire game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team, runners-up to City for the past two years, have taken just one point from their last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we weren't our best version. It's about how you react to that. We're not going to find the right words or answers to describe how we feel," said Arteta, whose side are seven points adrift of first place.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Anfield, Liverpool were in danger of a surprise loss of their own before regrouping to take advantage of their rivals' stumbles with a 2-1 win over Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferdi Kadioglu gave Brighton the lead in the 14th minute with a fierce strike that cannoned in off the post after Danny Welbeck flicked on Kaoru Mitoma's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Liverpool had beaten Brighton in the League Cup last 16 in midweek and they repeated the trick thanks to a late revival.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo bagged the equaliser in the 69th minute with a cross that looped straight into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three minutes later, Mohamed Salah put Liverpool ahead, the Egypt forward curling a fine finish into the top corner for his ninth goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Arne Slot's first season in charge, Liverpool are two points clear of City after their eighth win in 10 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "More than the position we are in, if you face a team like this and are 1-0 down and can come back to a 2-1 win that gives me a lot of confidence," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest are up to third place after beating 10-man West Ham 3-0 to make it three consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood grabbed his eighth goal in 10 league games in the 27th minute and West Ham had Edson Alvarez sent off in first-half stoppage-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Callum Hudson-Odoi struck in the 65th minute and Ola Aina sealed the points 12 minutes from full-time at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Ayew's stoppage-time equaliser denied third-bottom Ipswich their first top-flight win since 2002 as Leicester rescued a 1-1 draw at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leif Davis' 55th-minute volley put Ipswich ahead but the hosts had Kalvin Phillips sent off in the 77th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-bottom Southampton earned their first league win this season as Adam Armstrong's 85th minute strike sealed a 1-0 success against Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winless Wolves remain bottom of the table after Marc Guehi's 77th minute equaliser earned Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw at Molineux. (AFP)

<img alt="Spaniard Jorge Martin and his team celebrate after he won Saturday's sprint race in Malaysia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777334_1_20241102191043.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jorge Martin took a major step towards his first MotoGP world title as he won the sprint race in Malaysia on Saturday and rival Francesco Bagnaia crashed out.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spain's Martin extended his championship lead to 29 points from 17, with just the grand prix on Sunday at Sepang and one more race weekend to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a bitter blow for Italian two-time reigning champion Bagnaia, who started on pole but came off his Ducati early on to gift a big advantage to Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pramac Ducati's Martin romped home nearly a second ahead of six-time world champion Marc Marquez and can seal the title on Sunday if he earns nine more points than Bagnaia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year I wasn't ready to win," said the 26-year-old Martin, who came second in the title race behind his rival last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This season I am more mature. It is a privilege to be here at this point with this advantage, but nothing is over till it's over."
  <br>
  <br>
  Light rain fell at a sweltering Sepang five minutes before the start of the 10-lap sprint, adding to the tension on the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia started on pole with Martin alongside him on the front row, only for the Spaniard to seize the lead at the first corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  With eight laps to go and pushing hard, Bagnaia lost control of his Ducati at turn nine and slid out.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was unhurt but had his head in his hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I entered the corner a bit slower but I touched the back on the apex of the corner and I lost the front," said the 27-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's something that can happen, but all the risk I was taking to fight back with Jorge wasn't over the limit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia dominated Friday's practice and clocked a track record to grab pole for the sprint and the grand prix on Sunday, when 25 points are up for grabs for the winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think Pecco will risk a lot tomorrow to win," Martin said of the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to beat him in these conditions is really tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has nothing to lose now. It's all or nothing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The season finale had been scheduled for Valencia in a fortnight but it was cancelled on Friday after deadly flooding in that part of Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers are rushing to find a replacement venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  A minute's silence was held in Sepang before the sprint race to remember the more than 200 dead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now all my prayers are for Valencia and people at home," said Martin. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA champion Boston Celtics, fueled by 32 points from Jayson Tatum, bounced back from an overtime defeat with a gritty 124-109 victory over the Hornets in Charlotte on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tatum added 11 points for his third double-double of the season and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points with six rebounds and five assists in a physical game that saw tensions erupt in the fourth quarter when former Celtic Grant Williams sent Tatum sprawling with a shoulder-to-shoulder check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williams was ejected, but Brown and others were clearly angered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Less than a minute later, LaMelo ball was assessed a flagrant foul for crowding in under Tatum as the Celtics star attempted a three-pointer, and Charlotte's Miles Bridges was ejected in the final minutes for punching the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  It all could make for fireworks when the teams face off again on Saturday, but Charlotte's loss of composure was costly.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Toronto, the Los Angeles Lakers let a 26-point lead dwindle to single digits but held on to snap a two-game losing streak with a 131-125 victory over the Raptors.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James set the tone early, scoring 14 of his 27 points in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis poured in 38 points and pulled down 12 rebounds in another monster offensive effort. However, he was more concerned that the Lakers, up 76-51 at halftime, let the Raptors back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toronto had cut the deficit to six points early in the fourth quarter and the Lakers' lead was at eight, 106-98, when Rui Hachimura drilled a pair of three-pointers to push Los Angeles' advantage back to 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  That lead was halved with 1:02 remaining before the Lakers closed it out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unacceptable," Davis said. "We won, and we'll take the win for sure because it's hard to win in this league, especially on the road. (AFP)

<img alt="South Africa's squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777244_1_20241101193342.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Who starts at fly-half and scrum-half will command most attention when world champions South Africa launch a three-Test tour of Britain on November 10 against Scotland in Edinburgh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Creative Manie Libbok and ace goal-kicker Handre Pollard are the rivals for the playmaker role while Jaden Hendrikse, Cobus Reinach and Grant Williams eye the number 9 shirt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young fly-half Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu, the find of the season for the Springboks, misses out as he recovers from a knee operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Calm under intense pressure, Pollard has started four of 10 Tests this year and boasts a near 80 percent goal-kicking record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Libbok was a starter just twice, and an erratic goal kicker with a 58 percent success rate. He has been hailed, however, for his handling, running and ability to create scoring chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time World Cup-winning scrum-half Faf de Klerk was available after a lengthy absence due to a thigh injury, but did not make the squad, possibly because he last played in mid July.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa, who beat Italy and England and lost to France and Ireland on their last end-of-season tour two years ago, are seeking a first sweep since 2013.
  <br>
  <br>
  If head coach Rassie Erasmus opts to kick off the tour – which also includes internationals against England and Wales – with his strongest side most of the other 13 selections appear clearcut.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Damian Willemse ruled out by a groin injury, Aphelele Fassi should continue at full-back after a superb return to form this year following two seasons in the Test wilderness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wings Cheslin Kolbe and Kurt-Lee Arendse and centres Jesse Kriel and Damian de Allende have been first choices throughout a season in which South Africa have won eight of 10 Tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erasmus has three hookers to choose from with Bongi Mbonambi and often outstanding impact player Malcolm Marx favoured to make the matchday 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loosehead Ox Nche and tighthead Vincent Koch – in the absence of injured Frans Malherbe – are the likely props.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is stiff competition to join Eben Etzebeth in the second row. Leinster lock RG Snyman is used to British conditions and this may give him the edge over Franco Mostert and Ruan Nortje.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pieter-Steph du Toit, considered by many Springbok supporters as the best rugby player in the world this year, and captain Siya Kolisi are the first-choice flankers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loose forward Duane Vermeulen retired after South Africa edged arch rivals New Zealand 12-11 in Paris last October to win back-to-back World Cup finals, and a record fourth title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  That opened the door for Jasper Wiese to inherit the number 8 shirt, although Cameron Hanekom, who can operate in all three back-row positions, is a rising star and potential challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hanekom, fly-half Jordan Hendrikse, hooker Johan Grobbelaar and tighthead Wilco Louw were late additions in place of injured trio Willemse, prop-hooker Jan-Hendrik Wessels and Malherbe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The squad includes 26 of the 35 World Cup winners from last year and 10 of the starting line-up against the All Blacks in the title decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a healthy mix of youth and experience with most of the players having made strong statements in the Springbok jersey this season," says Erasmus.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having played key coaching roles in the 2019 and 2023 World Cup triumphs, Erasmus faces fresh challenges ahead of the next global showpiece, which Australia will host in 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the triumphant squad of last year will be closer to 40 than 30 by the next World Cup, and Erasmus admits age is a factor as he plots the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot look too far ahead and forget the present. But we also cannot get stuck in the present. There are guys in the squad who were not there before the last World Cup," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erasmus says his aim before 2027 is to develop a squad in which "ideally there are three excellent players competing for every position." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Valencia will not host the final MotoGP of the season organisers announced on Friday, owing to the devastating flooding in the east of Spain.
 <br>
  <br>
  The race was due to be held on November 17 and a new venue will be "confirmed as soon as possible" said organisers in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many of the top MotoGP riders had called for the race to be moved away from Valencia after the devastating floods which have killed at least 205 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Floods devastated towns, piling up cars collapsing bridges and filling streets with mud in Spain's biggest such disaster for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been in constant contact with the local authorities and the circuit to best assess how we can help and how we should proceed," said MotoGP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After carefully weighing up the potential positive impact of MotoGP racing in Valencia on delayed dates versus ensuring no single resource is diverted from the recovery efforts by the presence of MotoGP, the championship and local authorities have been obliged to cancel the 2024 Valencia GP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In lieu of racing in Valencia, MotoGP will instead race for Valencia... the championship will put our collective efforts behind backing the relief funds already in place."
  <br>
  <br>
  The penultimate race takes place in Malaysia this weekend with Spaniard Jorge Martin top of the standings, ahead of Italy's Francesco Bagnaia, who won the 2023 championship in Valencia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both riders backed a move away from Valencia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Primac Ducati rider Martin on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct... this could be wrong to race there," said Bagnaia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spanish reports said the Ricardo Tormo racetrack was not affected by the flooding but infrastructure around it was.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other sporting events in the region, including La Liga champions Real Madrid's visit to face Valencia due to take place on Saturday, have been postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is not the first time that top level motor sport in Europe has been cancelled because of flooding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2023 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola, Italy, was cancelled by Formula One organisers after flooding in the region. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim was on Friday named as the new manager of Manchester United, replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old Portuguese coach, who won two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon, has signed a deal until 2027 and will join the club on November 11.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ruben Amorim as head coach of the men's first team, subject to work visa requirements," the club said on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will join until June 2027 with a club option of an additional year, once he has fulfilled his obligations to his current club."
  <br>
  <br>
  United described Amorim as "one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until Amorim arrives at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  United sacked Ten Hag on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them languishing 14th in the Premier League, with just three wins from nine matches. (AFP)

    Morant leads Grizzlies over Bucks, Rockets hold on
   </title>

<img alt="Grizzlies' Morant drives the ball against Bucks guard Damian Lillard. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777176_1_20241101123409.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ja Morant's 12th career triple-double fired the Memphis Grizzlies to a 122-99 NBA victory over the reeling Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday as Houston edged the Dallas Mavericks.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but teammate Damian Lillard was held to four points on 1-of-12 shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brook Lopez was Milwaukee's next-highest scorer with 12 points as the Bucks dropped their fourth straight after opening the season with a win over injury-hit Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant was the engine, scoring 26 points with 10 rebounds and 14 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just came out being aggressive, took what the defense gave me," said Morant, who piled up 21 points in the first half to help Memphis build a 70-48 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had plenty of support as seven Grizzlies players, including all five starters, scored in double figures. Milwaukee never got the deficit below 18 points in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody was kind of in a good rhythm, we got it going early," Morant said after Memphis bounced back from a lethargic loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got stops," he said. "We were boxing out, we were getting out running, playing our game – that's how we want to play. If we want to do something in this league, that's what we've got to do each and every night."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks are clearly missing the contribution of injured Khris Middleton, who has yet to play this season as he recovers from an ankle injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought we played with the right spirit," Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. "We didn't make shots and you're going to have nights like that. But on those nights we have to find a way to get stops.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Morant had a free pass tonight as far as driving – we've got to do a better job of trying to figure out how to contain guards like that," Rivers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Dallas, the Rockets finally got the better of their Texas rivals, leading by as many as 23 points and hanging on for a 108-102 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Green scored 23 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who had lost six of their last seven games against the Mavs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green scored 11 in the fourth quarter to help the Rockets fend off a late Dallas surge. Dillon Brooks and Alperen Sengun added 17 points apiece for Houston, who out-rebounded Dallas 50-37.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mavs star Luka Doncic scored 15 of his 29 points in the final period, his step back three-pointer with 1:08 remaining pulling Dallas within three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amen Thompson and Brooks responded with baskets and the Rockets held on.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrie Irving scored 28 points for the Mavs, but Klay Thompson was the only other Dallas player to score in double figures with 12. (AFP)

    Yao Ming steps down as Chinese basketball chief

<img alt="The CBA confirmed it had approved Yao's resignation. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777150_1_20241101102242.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
  <br>
  <br>
  The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
  <br>
  <br>
  He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

    Top MotoGP riders want Valencia race moved

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Leading MotoGP riders called Thursday for the season finale in a fortnight to be moved out of Valencia because of deadly once-in-a-generation flooding in Spain.
 <br>
  <br>
  At least 95 people have been killed and troops, police and firefighters are racing to find survivors and victims in the Valencia region of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The MotoGP world title could go down to the final race weekend of the campaign, scheduled for the Circuit Ricardo Tormo just outside Valencia on November 16-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Spain's Jorge Martín, who tops the championship ahead of Italy's title-holder Francesco Bagnaia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in Sepang ahead of this weekend's Malaysia GP, the 26-year-old called on the sport's bosses to make a decision on a possible change of venue as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best thing would be to know right now so you approach the weekend in a different way," said the Pramac Ducati rider.
  <br>
  <br>
  Title rival Bagnaia, who is still in the fight just 17 points back, said the Spanish people "are living their worst dream".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct – this could be wrong to race there. If it was my choice, I'd prefer not to race there. We have many other options," said the Ducati rider.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Valencia track itself has not been damaged but there are question marks about some of the other infrastructure needed to host thousands of fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Márquez said the priority must be the recovery effort and not racing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to a year's rain fell in a few hours on the eastern city of Valencia and the surrounding region on Tuesday, sending torrents of water and mud through towns and cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a Spaniard, it's super-difficult to see these kinds of images," said Márquez. "Theorically, we have a GP there – but now I think all the facilities of the government, of Spain, need to go to the people who lost their houses."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain on Thursday started three days of mourning. (AFP)

    Alcaraz stunned by 18th-seed Humbert at Paris Masters

<img alt="Humbert shakes hands with Alcaraz at the end of the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777117_1_20241101071352.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number two Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the Paris Masters by 18th-ranked Ugo Humbert of France who swept to a third round victory in three sets on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Left-handed Humbert came through 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 to register his first win over the French Open and Wimbledon champion having lost twice to the Spanish star earlier in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a testing evening for Alcaraz who was 0-5 down in the first set before he managed to get on the board.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just super proud of myself that I did it," said Humbert who has won titles in Marseille and Dubai this season. "It was a crazy match, a crazy atmosphere."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went for every shot," added Humbert, looking back on his first set blitz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I think I had less energy in the second set, and after the third it was a mountain that was with me to the end," he said. "I trusted myself in big moments and I made some big shots."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Alcaraz has endured a rollercoaster second half of the season since his heartbreaking Paris Olympics final loss to Novak Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very intense match," admitted Alcaraz. "I started with some doubts about my game. Against a player who attacks whenever he can, who hits very aggressively at the slightest opportunity, it wasn't easy to get into the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was not up to the level he displayed," he added. "Ugo's performance was really high – the way he hits the ball is incredible."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcraz was knocked out in the second round of the US Open by 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, and defeated top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the Beijing final.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then suffered a quarter-final exit at the hands of Tomas Machac, the world number 33, at the Shanghai Masters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Humbert goes on to face Australia's Jordan Thompson for a place in the Paris Masters semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French number one just edged Alcaraz in winners on Thursday with 28 to 23 with both men committing 38 unforced errors. (AFP)

 Snooker superstar Ronnie O’Sullivan has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Department said on social media on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 48-year-old, known as the Rocket for his fast and attacking playing style, said he enjoyed his time in the SAR in the past and his sport is very popular in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan also said it’s a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My plan in Hong Kong is, obviously, here to do some work. But I love the food. I love to just, relax here in Hong Kong," he said in a video clip on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe I'm going to play some snooker, just see some friends maybe. It's just really nice to be back in Hong Kong again."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, currently ranked fifth in the world, won the Hong Kong Snooker Masters two years ago, saying at the time that he enjoyed the hiking trails in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  His decision to obtain Hong Kong residency comes after a similar move last year by retired basketball star Stephon Marbury, whose playing career spanned over two decades in the National Basketball Association in the US and the Chinese Basketball Association.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Los Angeles Dodgers produced a stunning fightback to defeat the New York Yankees and clinch the World Series on Wednesday with a dramatic come-from-behind 7-6 victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a night of spellbinding drama at Yankee Stadium, the Dodgers sealed their second Major League Baseball championship crown in five seasons and eighth overall after recovering from 5-0 down to complete a 4-1 series victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees, who had kept the series alive with an 11-4 rout in game four on Tuesday, had looked poised to take the series back to Los Angeles for game six after home runs from Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yankees starter Gerrit Cole meanwhile produced a masterful performance from the mound to keep the Dodgers' potent offensive line-up scoreless through four innings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a catastrophic fifth inning by the Yankees, which included a litany of defensive errors, saw the Dodgers pile on five unearned runs to tie the score at 5-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the Yankees regained the lead through a Stanton sacrifice-fly in the sixth inning, the Dodgers hit back in the eighth with sac-flys of their own from Gavin Lux and Mookie Betts to claim what turned out to be a winning 7-6 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers then brought back game three starter Walker Buehler to bag the final three outs in the ninth to clinch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously we're resilient, but there's so much love in this clubhouse, care – that care won this game today," said Dodgers star Betts. "That's what it was. It was love, it was grit – it was just a beautiful thing and I'm just proud of us and I'm happy for us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Buehler, meanwhile, admitted he had not been expecting to play a part in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wish I was in a little better shape so my heart could have handled it better," the Dodgers pitcher said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Dodgers star Freddie Freeman, who blasted four consecutive home runs in the opening four games of the series, was named Series Most Valuable Player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we were all saying the first three innings – 'let's just get one, just chip away, we can do this,'" said Freeman, who drove in two runs in the fifth inning rally with a single. "There's a couple of mistakes that happened, you've got to capitalise."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers had gone into Wednesday's game quietly confident, with victorious game one starter Jack Flaherty back on the mound.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Flaherty's eve-of-Halloween outing turned into a horror show as the revived Yankees bats cut loose to leave the Dodgers reeling.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and then Chisholm followed it with a solo shot to put the Yankees 3-0 ahead, before Alex Verdugo drove in a run for Anthony Volpe to make it 4-0 in the second, prompting Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to remove Flaherty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stanton's third inning solo home run made it a five-run game but after that dream start, the wheels fell off in the fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enrique Hernandez launched the Dodgers rally with a single to lead off the inning and then Tommy Edman was given a reprieve when Judge flubbed a catch in center-field that left the Dodgers with two men on base and no outs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a terrible mix-up between Cole and first baseman Anthony Rizzo allowed Betts to single and score Hernandez to make it 5-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeman then took full advantage, doubling to score Edman and Will Smith to make it 5-3 with runners on first and third. Teoscar Hernandez then drove a double to center-field to bring in two more runs and the game was suddenly tied at 5-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dodgers conjured another rally, with Lux and Betts bagging sac-flys to snatch a one-run lead at 7-6, leaving Buehler to close out victory in the ninth. (AFP)

    Lakers fall to Cavs as Bronny scores first NBA bucket

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It was a homecoming for Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James on Wednesday, as his son Bronny secured his first-ever NBA career bucket in their team's 134-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
 <br>
  <br>
  As the 39-year-old Lakers superstar watched from the bench, Bronny James scored his first points in an NBA game on a shot that looked just like his old man.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second game featuring a father-son duo, LeBron checked out in the fourth quarter and sat back to enjoy seeing his son soak in the love of a Cleveland crowd that cheered his every move for 11 seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the Cavs on their way to the blowout victory, Cleveland fans began chanting “We want Bronny!”, hoping to see the rookie they watched grow up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The younger James checked in with 5:16 left and was cheered every time he touched the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  He picked up two assists and then made his first basket as a pro on a 14-foot shot from the left corner with 2:03 left, triggering a huge ovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland took control with a red-hot first quarter, connecting on 77.3 percent of their shots from the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs led by 19 at halftime and turnovers doomed the Lakers' efforts to make significant inroads in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James led the Lakers with 26 points. Anthony Davis added 22 with 13 rebounds but Los Angeles dropped their second straight.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lakers head coach J.J. Redick had high praise for Bronny despite the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I told him congratulations,” he said. “It's a big deal to score your first NBA points, and the fact he did it back here in Cleveland was a bright spot.”
  <br>
  <br>
  When Bronny was little, he ran through the hallways, rode the elevators and took shots or played pickup on the practice court inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse – all while his famous father played in games for the Cavaliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Bronny reflected on his Ohio homecoming.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s going to be real special,” he said following the morning shootaround. “It feels good to be out here with my dad – in our home.”
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron spent 11 seasons over two stints with the Cavs, leading them to the 2016 title before leaving as a free agent two years later. Last week, the 39-year-old superstar and his 20-year-old son became the first father-son duo to play in an NBA game. (AP/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two New York Yankees fans who interfered with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts as he tried to make a catch were barred from Wednesday's fifth game of the World Series.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees announced hours before the crucial clash in New York that the spectators, who were seated in the from row along the wall in foul territory in right field, were ejected after trying to block the player and take the ball from his glove.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident happened in the first inning of New York's 11-4 victory, which lifted the Yankees within 3-1 in Major League Baseball's best-of-seven championship showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last night, two fans were ejected from Yankee Stadium for egregious and unacceptable physical contact with Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts," the Yankees said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The safety and security of players, fans and stadium staff is the foundational element of every event held at Yankee Stadium," it added. "It cannot be compromised."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however the exuberance of supporting one's team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk," the statement went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Yankees and Major League Baseball maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of behavior displayed last night – these fans will not be permitted to attend tonight's game in any capacity."
  <br>
  <br>
  Betts tried to make a grab off a ball hit by New York's Gleyber Torres but as he leaped above the wall in foul territory, one fan grabbed his right hand and the other pulled the ball from his glove.
  <br>
  <br>
  Torres was called out due to fan interference on the play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never seen anything like it," said Dodgers starting pitcher Ben Casparius.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That looked ridiculous from my perspective," Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman said. "The guy was trying to yank his glove off, pulling at his wrist. Looked like he got ejected and I'm glad he did. I've never seen anything like that – that was unacceptable." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Daniil Medvedev is still searching for his first ATP tournament victory this year after the world number five lost to Australia's Alexei Popyrin for the first time in his career at the Paris Masters on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev won the Paris title in 2020 but has not found the indoor tournament to his liking in recent years – the defeat to Popyrin is the third successive time he has gone out in his opening round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popyrin, who has been on a rich vein of form this year winning his first Masters tournament in Montreal in August and beating Novak Djokovic in the US Open, edged Medvedev 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a gripping second round match.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Popyrin, ranked 24 in the world, it was only his third win over a player in the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time I have beaten him," said Popyrin. "We have had some right old battles in the past and it is a real pleasure to have performed like this this time round."
  <br>
  <br>
  Popyrin will next play Karen Khachanov after the Russian downed France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (12/14), 6-1, 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who has already qualified for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals next month, fought back twice in the deciding set.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came back from 4-1 down to force a tie-break and then trailing 4-1 in that he levelled at 4-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, with Popyrin leading 5-4, Medvedev double-faulted giving the 25-year-old Australian two match points and he wasted no time in sealing the victory on the first one. (AFP)

    'Sports arbitration system to settle disputes quickly'

<img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776876_1_20241030170539.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
 <br>
  <br>
  Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
  <br>
  <br>
  International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Anthony Volpe smashed a grand slam as the New York Yankees avoided being swept in the World Series on Tuesday with an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Volpe's third-inning home run gave the Yankees a 5-2 edge, their first lead since game one, and later homers by Gleyber Torres and Austin Wells sparked New York's rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees pulled within 3-1 in the best-of seven Major League Baseball championship showdown with game five on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series, but the Yankees became the first team in 54 years to force a fifth game when down 0-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York denied the Dodgers an eighth World Series title and first since 2020 while keeping alive hopes of the Yankees winning their first crown since 2009 and 28th overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a record-shattering night for Los Angeles first baseman Freddie Freeman, who smashed a two-run homer in the first inning to become the first player with homers in the first four games of a World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeman, who blasted a walk-off grand slam to win game one, also moved past George Springer to set a record with homers in six consecutive World Series contests, counting the last two games from his 2021 title run with Atlanta. (AFP)

 Premier League strugglers Southampton squeezed into the English League Cup quarter-finals when James Bree struck a late winner to down Championship side Stoke 3-2 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  And another Premier League team, Brentford, also survived a major scare against second-tier rivals, beating Sheffield Wednesday on penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  At St Mary's, Southampton were sailing into the next round after Taylor Harwood-Bellis' header and Adam Armstrong's spot-kick inside 35 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But goals from Ashley Phillips and Tom Cannon threatened to force a penalty shoot-out until defender Bree rifled home from 25 yards with two minutes left on the clock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were fortunate to reach that stage still level as only a goal-line clearance from Yukinari Sugawara stopped Stoke substitute Million Manhoef completing the turnaround minutes earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints boss Russell Martin, who was serving a touchline ban after collecting a third booking of the campaign, made six changes to the starting XI which began Saturday's 1-0 loss at Manchester City, leaving the team footing the table with a solitary point from nine outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the night's other encounter, Brentford were bossing the show against Sheffield Wednesday after taking the lead through Kevin Schade in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wednesday levelled shortly before the hour with their first effort on target through Djeidi Gassama's spectacular strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford could not find a winner in normal time with Mark Flekken their hero, the goalkeeper saving Liam Palmer's penalty to send the hosts through 5-4 after a 1-1 draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I went to the wrong side twice at the start of the shoot-out," commented Flekken. "That doesn't help your confidence in a shoot-out but luckily I saved the last one".

 Qatar's Akram Afif was named Asian Football Confederation men's player of the year on Tuesday, while Japan's Kiko Seike took home the women's award.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forward Afif led Qatar to the Asian Cup title at the start of the year, being named player of the tournament and winning the golden boot with eight goals – including a hat-trick against Jordan in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second time the 27-year-old had been named Asian player of the year. He also won the prize in 2019 after winning the Asian Cup with Qatar for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif, who had stints in Belgium and Spain earlier in his career, also led club side Al Sadd to a domestic double in Qatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to thank my wife, teammates and all the national team coaches and administrative staff," he said at the AFC award ceremony in Seoul. "I will try my best to win this award for a third time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif became the third player to win the award more than once, following in the footsteps of Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata and Uzbekistan's Server Djeparov.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seike won the women's prize after scoring 20 goals to help Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies win the Japanese domestic title for a second straight year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forward Seike was also influential as Urawa won the Asian club title, and was part of the Japan squad that reached the quarter-finals at the Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy to receive this prestigious award," said Seike, who joined England's Brighton in July. "I will continue to do my best for my club, the national team and to raise the value of Asian football." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's Carlos Alcaraz opened his campaign at the Paris Masters on Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Chilean Nicolas Jarry.
 <br>
  <br>
  After receiving a bye through the first round, Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead in his round of 32 match but was reigned back in by Jarry, before eventually claiming the first set 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Alcaraz was in commanding form in the second set, giving his Chilean opponent only one game as he raced to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been two years since I have won a match here in Paris – so every time that I keep going is a gift for me," said the 21-year-old Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just really happy to get through the opening set, it was really important for me to come into the second with more confidence," he added. "I need time to get used to the speed of the court."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz is now the heavy favourite to win his first title on the hard court at Bercy Arena after Italian world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament earlier on Tuesday due to an intestinal virus.
  <br>
  <br>
  He will face either Frenchman Ugo Humbert or American Marcos Giron in the round of 16. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Freddie Freeman homered for a record-tying third consecutive game and the Los Angeles Dodgers reached the brink of a World Series title by beating the New York Yankees 4-2 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Freeman, who smashed a walk-off grand slam to win the opener in Los Angeles, crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and Walker Buehler threw five shutout innings allowing only two hits to spark the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win gives the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Major League Baseball championship series, meaning they can capture their first crown since 2020 by winning game four on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Freeman matched Hank Bauer in 1958 and Barry Bonds in 2002 as the only players to homer in the first three games of a World Series.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers first baseman also matched George Springer's record of homers in five consecutive World Series contests, including the last two games of Freeman's 2021 title run with Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees have not been swept in a World Series since Cincinnati did it in 1976. The most recent World Series sweep was by San Francisco over Detroit in 2012.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers seek their eighth World Series title while the Yankees, with a record 27 crowns, chase their first World Series title since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the 12th title showdown between two of baseball's most iconic teams, with the Yankees having beaten the Dodgers eight times and the Dodgers defeating New York three, including a 1963 sweep. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Paolo Banchero had the best night of his career on Monday night, tying the Orlando Magic record for points in a half – scoring 37 in the first two quarters against the Indiana Pacers.
 <br>
  <br>
  He finished with a career-high 50 points to equal the fifth-highest scoring effort in Magic history. Orlando won 119-115.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Man, I'm tired.” Banchero said after the first 50-point effort in the NBA this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Banchero, the league's rookie of the year two seasons ago and an All-Star last year, was 13 of 17 from the field in the half and finished 16 of 26 from the floor. He also had 13 rebounds and nine assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was just being in the zone,” Banchero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Felt like I was in an open gym, back at home, just working on my game," he added. "Every shot felt like it was going in, and it's a good feeling when you've got a day like that. Not every game is going to be like that – but I'm glad today was.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37 points in the half tied the mark set by NBA legend Tracy McGrady, also in the first half, for Orlando against Washington in the game where he finished with 62.
  <br>
  <br>
  “That first half was a magical first half, for sure,” Banchero said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Banchero's career-high entering Monday was 43 points, set January 3 against Sacramento. (AP)

    Rodri wins men's Ballon d'Or as Real Madrid boycott

<img alt="Manchester City's Rodri with the Ballon d'Or. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776627_1_20241029081012.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri was awarded the men's Ballon d'Or on Monday after winning a fourth consecutive Premier League title and Euro 2024, but Real Madrid boycotted the ceremony.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decision to award the prize for the world's best player to the deep-lying midfielder came as a surprise, with Real Madrid's Liga and Champions League double winner Vinicius Junior widely seen as the pre-ceremony favourite.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hours before the festivities in Paris, the Spanish club announced its delegation would not attend the ceremony at Chatelet Theatre because of what it perceived as a snub of Vinicius.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodri, 28, played a key role as City held off Arsenal to win the Premier League title last season and was named player of the tournament at Euro 2024 as unfancied Spain emerged triumphant in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the French organisers insisting that the identity of the winner was a closely-guarded secret this year, the news appeared to have leaked with Madrid announcing hours before the ceremony they would not attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati earlier won her second successive women's Ballon d'Or, after leading her club to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claiming the Nations League with her country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drama started hours before the ceremony as Spanish and European champions Real said if Vinicius was not the winner, then the award should go to his teammate Dani Carvajal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like the Brazilian, Carvajal scored in the 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the award criteria doesn't give it to Vinicius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to Carvajal as the winner," Real Madrid told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or and Uefa does not respect Real Madrid – Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Madrid contingent of nominees also included Kylian Mbappé, Antonio Rudiger, Fede Valverde and Jude Bellingham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the Ballon d'Or is chosen from the shortlist by an international jury of 100 specialist journalists. (AFP)

    Man Utd sack Ten Hag, reportedly set to appoint Amorim

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag, the Premier League club said on Monday, with the Old Trafford side 14th in the standings after nine games.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men’s first-team manager," the club said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old Dutchman's job was the subject of speculation for most of last season as United recorded their worst Premier League finish in eighth, and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.
  <br>
  <br>
  A surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, however, plus the fact Ten Hag was able to blame numerous injuries for their poor form earned Ten Hag another chance.
  <br>
  <br>
  He signed a new contract to extend his stay until 2026 and get another chance to restore the 20-times English league champions to former glories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Early results this season, however, suggested Ten Hag was not going to achieve that.
  <br>
  <br>
  But according to multiple British media reports, United will turn to Amorim, the 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon manager who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sky Sports reported United were prepared to pay Amorim's release clause.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe kept him on board following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the Premier League but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year extension of his contract to June 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  But United have shown little improvement this season and the 2-1 loss at West Ham was the final straw.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager," a statement by United read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future," it added. (Reuters/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean phenom Tom Kim on Monday said he is feeling confident ahead of his return to the Link Hong Kong Open in November, for the first time since 2020.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing," said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into," Kim said. "And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington rookie Jayden Daniels completed a stunning 52-yard touchdown pass on Sunday's final play to give the Commanders a shocking 18-15 victory over Chicago while the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs stayed unbeaten.
 <br>
  <br>
  Daniels, questionable until game time with a rib injury, scrambled to evade defenders then hurled the ball half the field to the goal line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bears defender Tyrique Stevenson tipped it from among a pack of players and into the end zone, where Noah Brown caught it for an astonishing "Hail Mary" game-winning touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was juiced up for sure. It was exciting," Daniels said. "That's like a once-in-a-lifetime experience – that was my first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just threw the ball up," he added. "I didn't see anything. I just heard people screaming and our sidelined rushing the field – that's how I knew."
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniels, who completed 21-of-38 passes for 326 yards, called it a miraculous play.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Las Vegas, Patrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to spark the unbeaten Chiefs over the host Raiders 27-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs became the seventh reigning Super Bowl champion to start the next campaign 7-0, the first since New England in 2019. Only Denver in 1998 managed to win another title after those starts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a pretty good game," Mahomes said. "We're building and going in the right direction."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the NFL's play of the season was by Daniels, who was feeling rib pain near the end of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's tough when you've got to throw the ball, have to rotate with it," Daniels said. "I started the game. I wanted to finish it – nothing was going to take me out of the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders grabbed a 12-0 lead but Chicago seized the lead on a touchdown with 23 seconds remaining, only to fall on an incredible play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's a hard way to lose," Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. "I've got to look at it, detail it out, and make sure we're better next time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders stayed atop the NFC East at 6-2. Chicago fell to 4-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown was overjoyed after catching the NFL's first go-ahead "Hail Mary" touchdown pass in the last 10 seconds of a game since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've got a team full of fighters," Brown said. "We don't give up until the final whistle. "Just try and get down there as fast as you can, get good position, hope Jayden can get the ball down there." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Sainz cruised to an emotional victory for Ferrari ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in Sunday's incident-filled Mexico City Grand Prix as Red Bull's series leader Max Verstappen was handed two 10-second penalties on his way to sixth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The stewards took a dim view of Verstappen's aggressive driving, the Red Bull driver twice forcing his title rival Norris off the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris grabbed second from Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari near the finish as the Briton enjoyed a major boost in his quest to deny Verstappen a fourth consecutive world championship.
  <br>
  <br>
  The McLaren driver cut 10 points off the gap to Verstappen which now stands at 47 with four race weekends remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew what to expect from Max," Verstappen said, speaking on the heavy price for his show of ruthlessness. "I respect him a lot as a driver and I expected it but it was not very clean driving in my opinion."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the second week in succession that the two title-chasers had clashed following a penalty for Norris at the United States Grand Prix. (AFP)

    Man Utd fall to West Ham, slip to 14th on table

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United's under-fire manager Erik ten Hag said he could only fault his side's finishing after a damaging 2-1 defeat for the Dutchman at struggling West Ham on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  United slipped to 14th in the Premier League table after Jarrod Bowen's controversial stoppage time penalty winner handed the Hammers all three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crysencio Summerville put West Ham in front against the run of play 16 minutes from time before Casemiro equalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hag was furious at the award of the spot-kick after VAR intervened when Matthijs de Ligt clashed with Danny Ings inside the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  United captain Bruno Fernandes had a red card rescinded after being sent-off in a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham last month and Ten Hag highlighted the inconsistency of when VAR decides to challenge the referee's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the season they explained the process of VAR – only when it is clear and obvious they should interfere," said Ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What they didn't do against Spurs, that was a wrong decision," he added. "Now they make a wrong decision interfering and both have big impact on the games. I don't criticise the personnel, I criticise the process."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was a familiar lack of wastefulness in front of goal that cost United a much-needed victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diogo Dalot missed an open goal, while Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes were also guilty of missing huge chances in a dominant first-half display.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We created so many chances, played so good football, especially in the first half. How I want my team to play in and out of possession," added Ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's return of eight goals from their first nine games is their worst in the Premier League era.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ten Hag's men have won just three of those matches and drawn all three of their opening games in the Europa League to leave their manager clinging on to his job.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he claimed to have seen positive signs in a 2-1 win over Brentford last weekend and a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce prior to their visit to the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this moment the luck is definitely not on our side. Last season was not different and near the end we turned it around," said Ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are so determined it will be the same this season," he added. "We have to turn this around and it will turn around if we keep playing like we are now." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah's equaliser salvaged Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Premier League title rivals Arsenal on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool began the weekend on top after winning 11 of their opening 12 games in all competitions under Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a draw sees the Reds fall one point behind Manchester City at the top of the table, with Arsenal now five points adrift of the leaders in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're in the business where you can be on top one week and then not," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We are in October and let's see what it brings us at the end of the season. Enjoy the ride."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka recovered from a hamstring injury to start for Arsenal and gave the home side the perfect start with a stunning touch and finish from Ben White's pass on nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Dijk quickly levelled from a corner, but Arsenal led again before half-time through Mikel Merino's header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool improved after the break and got their reward when Darwin Nunez teed up Salah for his eighth goal of the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Credit to Liverpool – we feel like we didn't play the full 90 minutes," said Saka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First half we showed our qualities, gave them nothing and they scored from a set piece," he added. "I can't think of another chance they had. Second half we weren't at our best." (AFP)

<img alt="The Ducati Lenovo Team rider celebrates his victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776439_1_20241027173426.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Francesco Bagnaia won the Thai MotoGP in wet conditions on Sunday to close the gap on championship leader Jorge Martin, who was second, with two race weekends left.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spaniard Martin's lead over defending champion Bagnaia, of Italy, was cut from 22 points to 17, ahead of another chapter in their title tussle at Sepang in Malaysia next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedro Acosta was third at a rainy Buriram, but this was all about Martin and Bagnaia, with the championship now a two-horse race and likely to go right down to the wire.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Malaysia, the season finale is at Valencia on November 15-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pramac Ducati's Martin, who is trying to win the world crown for the first time, said he was happy to settle for second, coming home nearly three seconds behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The level we are demonstrating -- not a lot of people can understand how fast we are going even in these conditions," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia thanked his Ducati team for keeping his hopes of a third world title in a row alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did an incredible job. So, so happy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin began the race on the front row in third and made a lightning start to grab the lead from his pole-sitting rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 26-year-old did not stay there long, running wide to fall to third as Bagnaia took the lead with six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez in hot pursuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the halfway point of the 26-lap race it had developed to a duel between Bagnaia and Marquez, with Martin struggling to keep up.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Marquez pushed too hard in trying to take the lead and slid off on his Ducati.
  <br>
  <br>
  That left the title rivals to battle it out for victory, but Bagnaia held his nerve and handled the demanding conditions to see out a crucial ninth win of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia also started Saturday's sprint race on pole but ended up third, just behind Martin. Bagnaia's Ducati team-mate Enea Bastianini won the sprint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Ai Ogura was crowned Moto2 world champion as he came second in a red-flagged race won by Spain's Aron Canet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Ogura will move up to MotoGP next season. (AFP)
