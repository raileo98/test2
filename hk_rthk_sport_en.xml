<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, mired in a four-game losing streak as the NBA playoffs approach, fired coach Michael Malone on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Malone led the Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023, but despite the exploits of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets have struggled for consistency this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are fourth in a tight Western Conference race with four teams just a half-game behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Denver Nuggets have relieved head coach Michael Malone of his duties and will not extend general manager Calvin Booth," the Nuggets said in a statement, adding that assistant coach David Adelman will assume head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets have three games remaining in the regular season, which concludes on Sunday. (AFP)

    Referees to wear body cameras at Club World Cup

<img alt="During this year's competition refs will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799493_1_20250408234007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Referees at this year's Club World Cup will be equipped with body cameras and instructed to implement new rules to cut down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, Fifa announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by Ifab, the sport's lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the offence is rarely penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13. (AFP)

 English Premier League giants Manchester United on Tuesday announced that they'll play a friendly in Hong Kong next month as part of their post-season Asian tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match against Team Hong Kong, China, will take place at Hong Kong Stadium on May 30.
  <br>

  Organisers said on social media tickets for the game will go on sale on Cityline on Friday and that they'll hold a press conference the day before that about the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils will also make a stop in Kuala Lumpur two days before that.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Florida and Walter Clayton somehow overcame Houston’s tough defence on Monday night to carve out a 65-63 victory in an NCAA title-game thriller which was not decided until Clayton’s own D stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was getting Houston’s Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning three points in the final seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for travelling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, and they won their third overall title and first since 2007, this time led by third-year coach Todd Golden.

    Medvedev battles past Khachanov at Monte Carlo

<img alt="Daniil Medvedev advanced to the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799341_1_20250408081254.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Daniil Medvedev navigated his way into the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Monday, eventually seeing off former world number eight Karen Khachanov 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open winner Medvedev fought through in just shy of three hours on Court Rainier III against Khachanov, after having been a set and a break up on his fellow Russian.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an early exit from the Miami Open last month caused the 29-year-old to exit the top 10, Medvedev got back to winning ways on clay as he chases his first title since claiming the Rome Open two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, 11th seed Ben Shelton was stunned by 42nd-ranked Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and there will be no showdown between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka after the Swiss was defeated by Alejandro Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton went down 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-1 to his Spanish opponent, who reached the 2022 final at Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wild card Wawrinka also played out an epic that lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours before succumbing 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Chile's Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Gael Monfils beat Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and Matteo Berrettini set up a second-round meeting with top seed Alexander Zverev after winning in straight sets against Mariano Navone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Auger-Aliassime went down to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, but fellow top 20 player Lorenzo Musetti avoided a similar fate by coming back from a set down to defeat qualifier Bu Yunchaokete of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic beat American Sebastian Korda and Marcos Giron overcame fellow North American Denis Shapovalov, both in straight sets. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle coasted to a 3-0 win over sorry Leicester on Monday to step up their Champions League charge and condemn the Foxes to an eighth straight Premier League defeat without scoring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, still on a high after winning the League Cup last month, are up to fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea but with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth place will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season after strong performances by English clubs in continental competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But relegation for Ruud van Nistelrooy's hapless team is all but certain after a solitary season in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 2-0 up in the 11th minute after two goals from Jacob Murphy, the second a tap-in from close range after an audacious effort from Fabian Schar hit the crossbar, and Harvey Barnes added a third before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester last scored a league goal in front of their own fans against Brighton on December 8 and they are the first side in football league history to lose eight home league games in a row without scoring a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle boss Howe said his "biggest challenge" had been maintaining focus after the club ended their 56-year trophy drought in the League Cup final against Liverpool last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't compliment them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a very down to earth, humble group who want to do well and represent the club in the right way. They have shown that in the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe said the race for the Champions League was "going to hot up".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next week for us is a big week. We have three really tough games (against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa) and that will go a long way in seeing where we are at the end of the season." (AFP)

    Southampton sack manager Ivan Juric after relegation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton have sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, the club announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were condemned to relegation in record time after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric's bottom-of-the-table side have lost 25 of their 31 top-flight games in a wretched campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation with seven fixtures left gives Southampton, last season's Championship play-off winners, an unwanted Premier League record, surpassing Derby and Huddersfield's relegations with six games left in 2008 and 2019 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric took over from Russell Martin in December, with Southampton already deep in trouble, but the 49-year-old won only one league match, at Ipswich in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints have lost seven of their past eight league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that we have today reached an agreement with our men's first-team manager, Ivan Juric, to end his spell at the club," said a Southampton statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, we haven't seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Rusk will take charge of the team as interim manager for the remainder of the season and will be assisted by Adam Lallana. (AFP)

    Djokovic not setting sights high for Monte Carlo

<img alt="Novak Djokovic says his eye infection began during the recent Miami Open semi-finals. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799230_1_20250407125952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World No 5 Novak Djokovic, a finalist at the recent Miami Masters, said he did not have high expectations for the Monte Carlo Masters as he was suffering from the effects of an eye infection.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic is a two-time winner in Monte Carlo but has not won any title since taking the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard courts of Miami marked a return to form even though the 37-year-old lost the final in straight sets to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm glad that I found at least in Miami that joy on the court and, I feel, performance level," said the former world No 1 on Sunday ahead of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's see if I can carry that into clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a completely different surface and I didn't have much time to get used to this tournament, so my expectations are not really high for the results here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's more about trying to get matches and as many as possible, and obviously try to peak towards the end of the clay season which is, of course, most importantly in Paris."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French Open, which takes place on the red clay of Roland Garros between May 25 and May 8, is the second Grand Slam event of the season, following the Australian Open where Djokovic reached the semi-finals before bowing out, injured, to Alexander Zverev.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb admitted, however, that the eye infection and "a little bit of a viral infection" that he has been dealing with over the last week made him think twice about competing in Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It started in semi-finals day in Miami and I did struggle with it in the finals but it's calming down, I guess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm visiting the doctor later today so let's see. It should be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a first round bye, Djokovic will face a second round match against either the Chilean Alejandro Tabilo or another veteran of the circuit, three-time Grand Slam winner Stanislas Wawrinka. (AFP)

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz says he is at peace with not being able to displace Jannik Sinner from his top ranking. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799227_1_20250407124847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz said pressure to reclaim the world number one ranking from the suspended Jannik Sinner has had a negative impact on his form this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing," Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's my mindset right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th NHL career goal, etching his name into ice hockey history by finally passing the previous all-time record he shared with Wayne Gretzky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington Capitals ace Ovechkin – who had tied Gretzky's 26-year-old mark with two goals on Friday – scored on a power play early in the second period of Sunday's clash at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old Russian icon smashed in a long-range shot with 12:34 remaining in the second period to spark wild celebrations at the UBS Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overjoyed Ovechkin dived along the ice in delight after his momentous strike, before being mobbed by team-mates as a packed arena rose in a standing ovation to the Russian's achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice hockey's "Great One" Gretzky was in attendance along with National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman to witness Ovechkin's history-making strike, which was greeted by deafening chants of "Ovi, Ovi".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin meanwhile celebrated with his mother, wife and children, who came on to the ice as play was halted to mark the occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," Ovechkin said in an address to the stadium after play was stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, it's a team sport and without my boys, the whole organisation, the fans, the trainers, I would never stand here. I would never have passed 'The Great One'," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So fellas, thank you very much, I love you so much...And the last thing – to all of you fans around the world, in Russia, we did it boys."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky meanwhile also spoke in tribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that," the Canadian told the crowd. (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance after a dismal derby at Manchester United ended in a 0-0 stalemate. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799169_1_20250407081504.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side must improve "everywhere" after a dismal derby against Manchester City ended 0-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance as they remain fifth in the Premier League, which should be enough to reach next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third," said Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A contest devoid of quality, intensity or fight summed up a dreadful season for both sides of the Manchester divide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct," said United captain Bruno Fernandes. "In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened," said Guardiola. "We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacle did marginally improve after the break as Omar Marmoush's powerful effort from a corner stung the palms of Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount's introduction off the bench added more thrust to the United attack in the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had a chance to win it when Zirkzee's shot was clawed away by Ederson and Rico Lewis did well to get in the way of Mount's follow-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were smiles during a warm embrace between Guardiola and Amorim at full-time but those pleasantries disguised the fact that neither man can be happy with the state of their sides after a disappointing campaign. (AFP)

    Doncic soars as Lakers silence Thunder

<img alt="Luka Doncic shoots between Oklahoma City Thunder guards Alex Caruso and Cason Wallace during the second half at Paycom Center. Alonzo Adams-Imagn Images/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799203_1_20250407110657.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers produced a devastating display of long-range shooting to score a surprising 126-99 blowout over the No1 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder.
 <br>
  <br>
  A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile said the Lakers had been determined not to let up after making a fast start against the Western Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA," James said. "They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves meanwhile believes the result augured well for the final week of the regular season, which reaches its conclusion on April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge," Reaves said. "The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boston Celtics meanwhile kept their slim hopes of grabbing No1 seed from Cleveland with a 124-90 rout of the Washington Wizards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said on Sunday that foreign elite runners arrived to take part in the first Pyongyang Marathon in six years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Athletes from China, Romania and other countries arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage from KCNA showed hundreds of runners taking off from the stadium track starting point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon is part of celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung in 1912 and is the largest international sporting event in North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offers a rare opportunity for visitors to run through the streets of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon course winds through central Pyongyang, passing key landmarks and heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, before returning back to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last edition of the Pyongyang Marathon was held in 2019 before the pandemic, during which the state sealed its borders in an effort to contain the virus. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen led from pole to chequered flag to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, his first victory of the 2025 season, with McLaren's Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough. The McLarens were pushing me very hard," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a lot of fun but not easy pushing the tyres. I am incredibly happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting on pole made it possible to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with RB's Isack Hadjar next ahead of Williams' Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th in his first race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, having started from 14th on the grid in his home grand prix. Lawson was 17th for RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen and Norris were involved in a flashpoint midway through the race as the two front-runners emerged from a pit stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris drew up alongside Verstappen but the Dutchman refused to budge and Norris was forced onto the grass before sliding back onto the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said "he forced me off" but Verstappen told his team that he was not to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He drove himself onto the grass," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards reviewed the incident and decided not to investigate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has struggled to get to grips with his Red Bull this season, finishing second in Australia and fourth in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pulled off a lap for the ages in qualifying in Suzuka, pipping Norris to claim his first pole of the season in a track-record time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen got away cleanly from Norris and Piastri at the first turn, with little change in the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman quickly established control by laying down the fastest lap and his lead grew over the early part of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen-year-old rookie Antonelli briefly took the lead while Verstappen and Norris were in the pits, to become Formula One's youngest-ever race leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen soon reclaimed the lead and his team gave him the green light to push until the end of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two McLarens stayed on his tail, with Piastri telling his team "I have the pace to get Max" but Verstappen could not be caught.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Suzuka had been dry all week, with a series of small trackside fires halting practice several times but rain early on Sunday removed any chance of a repeat in the race. (AFP)

 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior came up just short at the Dubai Turf, as trainer Danny Shum's champion was edged by the slimmest of margins by Soul Rush from Japan in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jockey James McDonald and the SAR's runners were among the leading pack for much of the 1,800 metre Grade One course, and led almost the entire way after the turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they were overtaken by jockey Cristian Demuro's Soul Rush on virtually the last stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his three-race trip in the Middle East, Romantic Warrior won the Jebel Hatta in Dubai and was also runner-up in the Saudi Cup in Riyadh.

 Nick Rockett, a 33-1 shot ridden by Patrick Mullins, won the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree on Saturday (April 5) in a top three sweep for horses trained by the Irish amateur jockey's father Willie.

  Last year's winner I Am Maximus finished second and Grangeclare West was third with another Mullins' horse Meetingofthewaters in fifth.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's faint hopes of catching Premier League leaders Liverpool are almost over after their 1-1 draw at Everton, while Aston Villa bolstered their bid for Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a frantic finale, Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke was shown a red card for his foul on Daichi Kamada.
  <br>

 Thomas Müller will leave Bayern Munich this summer after a 25-year career at the German club.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Müller said on Saturday, in a joint announcement with Bayern, that his “incredible journey” with his boyhood club will end in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder's contract is set to expire after the season and he's seen limited game time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s clear that today is not like any other day for me," Müller said. "My 25 years as an FC Bayern Munich player will come to an end in the summer. It’s been an incredible journey, shaped by unique experiences, great encounters and unforgettable triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel immense gratitude and joy that I got to make this career with my beloved club. The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain. What I want as a farewell should be clear: titles we can celebrate together, and moments we’ll remember fondly for a long time.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th on his Red Bull debut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out," said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Good but not enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifying was suspended for about eight minutes in Q2 when a small trackside fire broke out as sparks from the cars ignited the grass in the dry conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fifth such incident of the weekend, with the second and third practice sessions also disrupted by fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain has been forecast for Sunday's race. (AFP)

    Alex Ovechkin matches Gretzky's NHL record

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 NHL career goals on Friday, matching a mark that once seemed unassailable.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special," Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. "(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot," Ovechkin said. "Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys," he said with a nod to fans, "my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky," Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. "It hit the post and went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's buzzing right now," he said. "Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin's next chance to break the mark will come Sunday, when the Capitals play at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did break another record Friday, his 136th game-winning goal breaking the record he shared with Jaromir Jagr. (AFP)

 Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles.

  Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won both last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton," said the effervescent Pogacar. "Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace," Pogacar said. "He'll be in there on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for.
  <br>
  <br>
  First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is," said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne confirmed on Friday that he will leave the club at the end of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  De Bruyne, 33, has won 14 major trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here – and you deserve to hear it from me first," De Bruyne said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football led me to all of you - and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This City. This club. These people... gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what – we won everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian international has been instrumental in City's rise to the dominant force in English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was twice crowned players' player of the year in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 and is second in the Premier League's all-time standings for assists on 118.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract is due to expire at the end of June, but it remains unclear whether he will continue to see out his days as a City player at the Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 until July 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every story comes to an end, but this has definitely been the best chapter," De Bruyne added. "Let's enjoy these last moments together!" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the National Games test events – the Hong Kong International Track Cup – will be held from April 19 to 21, attracting professional cyclists from around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event will be held at the Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O, involving about 150 cyclists from over ten countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the organising committee, Steve Nip, said it is also the first time that 50 cyclists from local affiliated clubs will be invited to participate in elite and junior races.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Audiences can enjoy races involving world-class cyclists, and also cheer for cyclists from local affiliated clubs. I hope they can achieve good results with the advantage of racing at their home track," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, the vice president of the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China, also expressed hope for local cyclists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides the opportunity for the Hong Kong team and young cyclists from local affiliated clubs to showcase their skills," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public can also watch races of a high standard, and they can treat this as a warm-up for the National Games at the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR cyclist Ceci Lee, who will participate in the race, said she will step up training in the coming two weeks, especially on her sprinting skills, and she hopes she can achieve good results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local cyclist, Mow Ching-yin expects his condition to improve gradually as it is getting closer to the National Games, and he said he will focus on improving his endurance and speed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard tickets for the Track Cup can be had for HK$50, while a concession ticket costs HK$30.

<img alt="Spurs boss Ange Postecoglu had to endure chants of " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798934_1_20250404151409.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting "you don't know what you're doing" at the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants.
  <br>
  <br>
  For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot. (AFP)

 The United States is the sole bidder for the 2031 Women's World Cup, and the United Kingdom is set to host the 2035 tournament, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Uefa Congress in Belgrade, Infantino said the only bid for 2031 was "from the USA and potentially some other Concacaf members together, and 2035 is from Europe, from the home nations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino also said Fifa planned to increase the number of participating teams at the Women's World Cup from 32 teams to 48 in time for the 2031 tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's announcement comes after the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed last month that they would submit an expression of interest in staging the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  World football's governing body last month said it would only welcome bids for 2035 from Europe or Africa, saying that the identity of the hosts would be confirmed at a Fifa Congress in the second quarter of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States – who are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada the 2026 men's World Cup – also confirmed in early March that it would push ahead with a bid for 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Morocco had also been in the running with African nations invited to bid too, but Infantino's comments suggest they are now out of the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  The next Women's World Cup will take place in Brazil in 2027. (AFP)

    Sinner doping woes blamed on ex-physio

<img alt="Jannik Sinner's running afoul of anti-doping rules has been blamed on former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi by physical trainer Umberto Ferrara. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798835_1_20250403184040.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis world number one Jannik Sinner's former physical trainer Umberto Ferrara said on Thursday he was blameless in the case of the three-time Grand Slam champion testing positive twice for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner received a three-month ban agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in February after "admitting "partial responsibility" for team mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of them have been laid off by the 23-year-old since the affair came to light.
  <br>
  <br>
  WADA came to an agreement with Sinner after accepting he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara told Gazzetta dello Sport that he had used the spray himself for years after it was prescribed by a doctor for an illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I suggested Naldi use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara said he did not know Naldi had been gloveless and also not washed his hands after using the spray when he treated Sinner, especially after "the warnings he had given him".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With hindsight, it is easy to say I would not do things the same way," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am not proud of the behaviour of others."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have suffered during this affair owing to the bad faith of some," added Ferrara, who has since joined the entourage of 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be Sinner's second tournament after his return as he will also compete on home soil at the Italian Open in Rome from May 7-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reigning US and Australian Open champion Sinner reached the French Open semi-finals last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's tournament is scheduled to run from May 25 until June 8. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China, women's cycling team rode their way to victory at the three-day women's Tour of Thailand, while rising star Ceci Lee claimed second place in the individual general classification.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, Leung Wing-yee, Leung Bo-yee, Yang Qianyu and Kwan Tsz-kwan finished in an overall time of 19 hours, 43 minutes and 37 seconds, tying with the host nation’s Thai team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The title was ultimately awarded to Hong Kong based on superior stage placings across the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hervé Dagorne, head coach of cycling at the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), said the team worked very hard on every stage, and their win is a huge encouragement ahead of the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They bring together a team spirit that will help when we stay together back in Hong Kong, so that is really helpful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, 23, showcased her growing prowess by securing second place in the individual standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She claimed runner-up finishes in the first two stages and third in the final stage, narrowly edged out by Thailand’s Jutatip Maneephan, who dominated with a clean sweep of all three stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earned the white jersey, awarded to the tour’s best young rider.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said that Lee is "a talented cycling rider, but sometimes she misses confidence and it affects her decision or strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a long talk before she left and she was ready for a new start, especially after the disappointment in the Olympics last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She has been working on herself and she's still so strong that she makes good decisions  and she has the support of a team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She also has the support of a new coach, Ben Kersten, who joined HKSI one month ago, so this combination [brought] her to this result."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team now shifts focus to the National Games track cycling test event, set to take place in Hong Kong from April 19 to 21.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat ended Boston's nine-game NBA winning streak with a 124-103 victory that pushed the reigning champion Celtics further behind Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who rallied to beat New York.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 25 points to lead seven players to score in double figures for the Heat, who fought off a late Celtics surge to notch a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston connected on just 37.2 percent of their shots in the first half in the face of stout Miami defense and Miami pushed their lead to 22 points early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics, led by 24 points from Jaylen Brown, cut the deficit to three, but Miami had pushed it back to 10 entering the fourth quarter. After the Celtics pulled within four early in the final frame the Heat relentlessly pulled away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory solidified Miami's position in the Eastern Conference play-in while the Celtics fell five games behind the Cavaliers atop the conference with six games left in the regular-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 on impressive 10-of-11 shooting for the Cavs, who rallied from an early 15-point deficit to beat the Knicks 124-105 in Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but after closing the first half on a 10-2 scoring run the Cavaliers out-scored the Knicks 38-25 in the third quarter to seize control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't put our best foot forward at the start," Mitchell said. "We came out kind of sloppy. For the rest of the game, the last three quarters, we did what we were supposed to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell added six rebounds, five assists and three of Cleveland's five blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just trying to do everything I can to win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks remained three games ahead of the fourth-placed Indiana Pacers, who were fueled by 22 points and 10 assists from Tyrese Haliburton in a 110-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six finishers in each conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while the seventh- through 10th-placed teams will battle through the play-in tournament for the final two spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Houston Rockets clinched their first playoff spot in five years in emphatic style, beating the league-worst Utah Jazz 143-105. (AFP)

    Barca oust Atlético, set up Clasico Copa del Rey final

<img alt="Ferran Torres celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Spanish Copa del Rey semi-final second leg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798723_1_20250403061233.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona will face rivals Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final after Ferran Torres secured them a 1-0 win at Atlético Madrid, progressing 5-4 on aggregate from the semi-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Record 31-time winners Barca had the better of the clash at the Metropolitano stadium after the wild 4-4 first leg draw, and defeat leaves Diego Simeone's Atlético with little to play for in the rest of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Catalans are on the hunt for a potential quadruple and are unbeaten in 2025, stretching their run to 21 games without defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were the last team to triumph against Barcelona, winning before Christmas to go top of La Liga, but they now trail Hansi Flick's team by nine points with nine matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come," Torres said. "If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul.
  <br>
  <br>
  César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  With four minutes of stoppage time added on Atlético turned the screw, with Musso coming up for a late De Paul free-kick, but Barcelona held off the hosts to progress. (AFP)

    Stuttgart beat Leipzig to reach German Cup final

<img alt="Stuttgart's Maximilian Mittelstädt celebrates after their 3-1 win over RB Leipzig. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798718_1_20250403054223.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stuttgart set up a German Cup final clash with third-division Arminia Bielefeld after a 3-1 win over RB Leipzig.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Berlin," Hoeness said. "Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved closer to the Premier League title with a 1-0 win in the Merseyside derby against Everton, while Manchester City beat Leicester 2-0 to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak met Jacob Murphy's cross with a typically predatory strike in first-half stoppage time at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford levelled through Bryan Mbeumo's 66th-minute penalty after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope tripped Yoane Wissa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sandro Tonali lashed home from Harvey Barnes' assist in the 74th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa also remain in the hunt for a Champions League place after winning 3-0 at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford struck in the 51st minute, accelerating onto Morgan Rogers' pass for his third goal in his last two games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Asensio killed off Brighton in the 78th minute and Donyell Malen netted in added time to lift Villa into seventh place, two points behind Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Southampton wasted a chance to avoid becoming the worst team in Premier League history after a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at St Mary's. (AFP)

<img alt="Giannis Antetokounmpo's 37 points helped end a four-game losing skid for the Bucks. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798584_2_20250402114710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stephen Curry scored 52 points and Draymond Green added a triple-double as the Golden State Warriors clinched a crucial 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible," Kerr said. "Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. "I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a sight to behold how he operates," Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him," he continued. "I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now," Iisalo said. "It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish. (AFP)

<img alt="Bielefeld players celebrate winning their German Cup semi-final match against Bayern Leverkusen. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798544_1_20250402073801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Cup holders Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock 2-1 elimination at Arminia Bielefeld in the semi-finals of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should Bielefeld win in Berlin in May – they will face either RB Leipzig or Stuttgart – the club will be rewarded with a Europa League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't need luck at all because we were on the front foot the whole time," home coach Michel Kniat said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kniat said he "normally wouldn't have a drink with the players, but tonight I'll make an exception", adding that "nobody will go to sleep in this city tonight".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said it was "by far our worst game of the season" and added that "Bielefeld deserved the win tonight, which means we did plenty of things wrong".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, RB Leipzig play away at Stuttgart in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, who have won two of the past three German Cups, will be managed by interim coach Zsolt Low, who took over after Marco Rose was sacked on Sunday. (AFP)

<img alt="Antonio Rudiger, right, was among the scorers for Real Madrid. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798540_2_20250402062922.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level.
  <br>
  <br>
  A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal," Rudiger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final," he added. "It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate. (AFP)

<img alt="Bukayo Saka scored in his first appearance with Arsenal since December. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798535_2_20250402054006.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 to close in on Champions League football next season as Bukayo Saka scored in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Fulham on his return from injury.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former United winger Anthony Elanga came back to haunt his former club with a stunning solo effort after just five minutes at the City Ground to earn all three points for Nuno Espirito Santo's side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-placed Forest extend their lead over Newcastle in sixth to 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions this season, the top five will almost certainly qualify for the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest are two-time European champions but have not played in the continent's elite competition since they were holders in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elanga was discarded by United in 2023 after a bright start to his career at Old Trafford, but is one of many Forest success stories fulfilling his potential under Nuno.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international collected possession deep inside his own half but showed blistering pace to burst into the United box before firing low past Andre Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a year after battling to narrowly avoid relegation, Forest are enjoying an unexpected fairytale season that also includes progressing to the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had been forced through 120 minutes and penalties to beat Brighton in Saturday's quarter-final and were also without top scorer Chris Wood due to injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest fatigued in the second half, but United were undone by a familiar lack of cutting edge going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim resorted to sending on centre-back Harry Maguire as a makeshift striker in the closing stages and he nearly grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time when his shot was cleared off the line by Murillo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United remain without two consecutive Premier League wins all season with the Red Devils languishing down in 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal maintained some pressure on leaders Liverpool by cutting the gap at the top to nine points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka stole the headlines by coming off the bench to head in on his first appearance since December 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino's deflected effort had given Arsenal a first-half lead. However, victory came at a cost as key defender Gabriel Magalhães limped off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz pulled a goal back in stoppage time, but defeat is a blow to Fulham's ambitions of European football next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just one week away from the Gunners' Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid, the sight of Gabriel pulling up with a hamstring problem added to Mikel Arteta's injury woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are already without forwards Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus due to season-ending injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Merino has proved an able deputy as a stand-in striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish midfielder took his tally to five goals in eight games in his new role, albeit with the aid of a big deflection to open the scoring on 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka's introduction was greeted with the biggest cheer of the night until that point at the Emirates Stadium when he replaced Ethan Nwaneri 25 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international took just eight minutes to net his 10th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was in the right place to head in from close range after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the bottom of the table, Wolves pulled ever closer to survival with a 1-0 win over West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal at Molineux as Wolves moved 12 points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

    Ng On-yee happy that billiards keep Tier A status

<img alt="Ng On-yee shows off her British Open trophy upon her return to Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798472_1_20250401170234.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker star Ng On-yee said a decision by the government last week allowing billiards to retain its Tier A status will help the players as well as the sport's overall development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR snooker queen returned to Hong Kong on Tuesday after defending her title at the British Open in Walsall, England with a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ng said maintaining billiards' Tier A status not only provides important recognition for athletes, but also allows coaches to develop better training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two key factors allowed me to play more freely in this tournament – first, having already secured my World Snooker Tour qualification early, and second, knowing that snooker would maintain its status at the Sports Institute. These significantly reduced my pressure," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the move will give more confidence to young athletes developing their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also spoke about getting into the right frame of mind in the British Open final when her opponent rallied from a 3-0 deficit to force a decisive seventh and final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was leading 3-0, I started thinking just one more frame to win, and that's when I got a bit tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After being pulled back to 3-3, I told myself to stop over-thinking – just treat it like the first frame again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Focus on taking every chance that comes, forget what's happened before, and concentrate completely on the current frame."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng will next play in the World Women’s Snooker Championship 2025 in Dongguan between May 20 and 27.

<img alt="Isaiah Joe came up big off the bench in the Thunder's win over the Bulls. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798427_2_20250401125400.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Veteran Al Horford turned back the clock to help the NBA champion Boston Celtics notch a ninth straight victory and nab a franchise first with a 117-103 win over the Grizzlies in Memphis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Horford, 38, led the Celtics scoring with 26 points off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum added 25 points and 14 rebounds and the Celtics defense stymied the Grizzlies in the second half to complete a perfect 6-0 road trip – the longest unbeaten road swing in the club's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, second in the Eastern Conference behind the Cleveland Cavaliers, won all six games by double digits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Horford scored his season-high, draining six of Boston's 21 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a lot of fun," Horford said. "It's pretty amazing for me to be in this position and I'm just trying to have fun with it and enjoy with my team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant scored 26 points for the Grizzlies, who led by as many as 11 in the first half and regained the lead early in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, however, they couldn't keep pace and lost ground in their fight with the Los Angeles Lakers for fourth place in the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder, already assured of the Western Conference top seed, racked up their 10th straight victory with a 145-117 pounding of the Chicago Bulls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaiah Joe came off the bench to score 31 points – leading seven Thunder players to score in double figures as Oklahoma City improved to 28-1 against Eastern Conference opponents – the NBA record for most wins by a team against an opposing conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have the same goal in mind," said Joe, who made eight of the Thunder's 23 three-pointers. "We know what we want to do at the end of the day and we know how to get there. We've just got to keep stacking days, stacking games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers rallied from 16 points down in the third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-109 and maintain their grip on fourth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 18 points and handed out 11 assists, drilling a three-pointer with just over one minute remaining that gave Indiana the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers, eighth in West but locked in a battle with Golden State and Minnesota for sixth place and direct entry to the playoffs, clawed out a gritty 96-87 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 21 points each and Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 20 rebounds – including nine on the offensive end – to help the Clippers finally seize control in a game that featured 15 lead changes in the first three quarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolo Banchero scored 26 points and Franz Wagner added 21 for the Magic, who remained in eighth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the each conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Miami Heat climbed to ninth – ahead of the Bulls – with a fifth straight victory, beating the Wizards 120-94 in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Tyler Herro added 27 points for the Heat, whose current winning streak comes on the heels of a 10-game skid. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker player Ng On-yee on Monday defeated World No. 1 Mink Nutcharut of Thailand to defend her title at the British Open in Walsall, England.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng's 4-3 victory is the SAR athlete's second ranking crown of the season, following her dominance at the US Women's Snooker Open in August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also solidifies her hold on second place in the world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng, 34, has now claimed 22 ranking titles since her maiden victory in 2012, when she won the Northern Championship without losing a frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was close to her best throughout the tournament, having scored four of the top five breaks – including a near-flawless century break of 113 during her quarter-final victory against compatriot So Man-yan on Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major League Baseball has suspended Atlanta Braves slugger Jurickson Profar for 80 games after he tested positive for the performance-enhancing chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), MLB announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspension of the 32-year-old outfielder is more bad news for an Atlanta team that has started the season 0-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  He signed a three-year, US$42 million deal with the Braves in January, and will be suspended through the end of June. Although he can return in July for the remainder of the regular season, Profar will not be eligible to play in the 2025 postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that Jurickson Profar tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program," the Braves said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar, who hit a career-high 24 home runs for the San Diego Padres last year, issued a statement through the MLB Players Association, calling the announcement "the most difficult day of my baseball career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar wrote in a statement that he tested positive in the off-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to apologise to the entire Braves organisation, my teammates, and the fans," he said. He added that he "would never knowingly do anything to cheat" and that he "would never willingly take a banned substance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I take full responsibility and accept MLB's decision," he concluded. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were dealt a major blow with leading scorer Erling Haaland set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury as the season reaches its climax.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Norwegian was injured in Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having just scored his 30th goal of the season to level the tie, he was then hurt in a challenge with Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League champions did not provide a timescale for the player's return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expectation is that Erling will be fit in time to play a further part in the remainder of this season, including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup," said a club statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Erling underwent initial tests in Manchester on Monday morning and will now seek specialist consultation to confirm the full extent of the injury. Assessment remains ongoing to ascertain a full prognosis," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are currently fifth in the Premier League and battling to ensure a spot in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side face matches against Leicester and Manchester United this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then have a visit from Crystal Palace and a trip to Everton before their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, at Wembley on April 26. (AFP)

<img alt="The initiative for the Grand Tours has been rubber-stamped by the International Cycling Union, the sport's governing body. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798362_1_20250401071622.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana will all involve 23 teams from this year, with the initiative rubber-stamped by the International Cycling Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  The extra teams come from extra wildcard invitations, an initiative proposed by the Professional Cycling Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  The total number of riders will shift from 176 under the 22-team model, to 184 with 23 teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The UCI Management Committee has approved the request submitted by the PCC to increase the number of teams participating in the men's Grand Tours (Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and La Vuelta a Espana) to 23," the UCI said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expansion aims to support second division teams, while enabling organisers to strengthen the line-up for their race and give riders from the additional teams the opportunity to compete in a Grand Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 18 top-tier World Tour teams take part in the Grand Tours, with extra invitations given to teams from the second-tier Pro Tour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tour de France organisers immediately announced their full line-up for the 2025 race with the top two Pro-Tour teams Lotto and Israel Premier Tech, plus three wild cards in Total Energies, Tudor Pro Cycling and Uno X Mobility. (AFP)

 Rory McIlroy has joined Tiger Woods in surpassing US$100 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, becoming just the second player to do so.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Northern Irishman reached the landmark during the Houston Open over the past weekend, where a four-way tie for fifth netted him more than US$300,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, 35, has secured 28 victories out of 262 PGA Tour events since his debut in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods, now 49, crossed the US$100 million threshold in 2012 and has since accumulated US$120 million in prize money with 82 wins in 378 events. (Reuters)

 Four of the world’s top football teams will be coming to Hong Kong this summer for pre-season friendlies as they gear up for the 2025-26 season, organisers said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  English Premier League giant Liverpool and Serie A side AC Milan will face off on July 26 for the Standard Chartered Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two other English Premier League teams Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will meet on July 31, marking the first north London derby outside of the UK.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two games will take place at the new 50,000-capacity Kai Tak Stadium, with the retractable roof closed and air conditioning under each seat to make the upcoming hot and humid weather more bearable.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rachael Carroll, managing director of TEG sport, organiser and promoter of the festival, said the Hong Kong Football Festival will attract at least 100,000 fans both locally and from outside the SAR, which will generate great value for the local economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a wonderful opportunity to really launch Kai Tak Sports Park globally, really put this on the map, and these are fantastic rivalries and to have these two big matches, two great rivalries to really celebrate the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park and have the eyes of the world on Hong Kong, we thought that that was appropriate," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course in the future, we would love to see international teams play local teams here in the market as well, so we think that this is going to be a great location for football in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser also said the three Premier League clubs will also hold open training sessions on July 24, 29 and 30 for fans to watch before the two exhibition matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ticket details will be announced shortly by the organiser.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic faced a series of obstacles in the Miami Open final: a delay of more than five-and-a-half hours before the match, an eye infection and a slippery court due to high levels of humidity following the rain.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the largest roadblock was the youth and power of 6-foot-4, 19-year-old phenom Jakub Mensik, who outdueled the 37-year-old Serbian in two tiebreakers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) to win his first ATP title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 54th entering the tournament, the Czech Republic teenager plowed through Djokovic with poise and a stellar 130 mph serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He collected 14 aces and got broken only once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik bashed a service winner on match point and fell on his back.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You’re the one I idolized when I was young,″ Mensik said to Djokovic during the ceremony after the match that lasted two hours and three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I started playing tennis because of you.″
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik’s victory spoiled the party for Djokovic, who was seeking his 100th career title and a record seventh in the Miami Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will have to wait, while the teenager looks ready to join the elite.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a joyous moment for him and his family – an unbelievable tournament, first of many,″ Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It hurts me to admit it, you were better. In the clutch moments you delivered the goods. For a young player like yourself, this is a great feature.″
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd pulled hard for Djokovic, who hadn’t played here since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of the fans stuck around despite the massive delay, chanting “No-vak!’’ and singing his name across critical parts of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, far from a fan favorite here earlier in his career, saluted the fans, saying it was one of the warmest crowds he’s had ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the men’s leader with 24 Grand Slam titles seemed compromised by his eye issue, with redness seen under the eyelid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic applied eyedrops during two changeovers in the first set. It was unclear if it affected his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the set, he also slipped twice on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The humidity reached 90 percent after hours of rain disrupted the card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweating profusely, Djokovic asked the umpire for a bucket of sawdust to sprinkle on his wet grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik had lost to Djokovic in a three-setter in October at the Shanghai Masters but the youngster said before the match he had played too nervously.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik was playing his first ATP 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was not quite two years old when Djokovic won his first Miami Open title in 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was more fearlessness this time than in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik got up 3-0 with an early break but Djokovic broke back at 4-3, then held for 4-4 after fans chanted his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik held for a 6-5 lead in a game that saw Djokovic take a tumble in the doubles alley chasing a drop shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik served it out with his seventh ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first-set tiebreak, Mensik charged ahead 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik executed a leaping backhand volley winner and Djokovic muffed a routine forehand drop shot into the net to fall behind 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  On set point, Mensik slugged an overhead smash for a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was scheduled for 3am Hong Kong time but the players didn’t take the court until almost six hours later due to rain and organisers deciding on completing the women’s doubles final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Florida rain began during the women’s doubles final pitting Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider against Cristina Bucsa and Miyu Kato, with Andreeva and Shnaider leading 3-0 in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s players returned to the court later after the rain stopped and the courts were readied by court-drying machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain began minutes later before warmups and the umbrella-toting players left the court again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women returned to the court an hour later and resumed play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva and Schnaider went the distance, prevailing in a third-set match tiebreaker 6-3, 6-7 (5), 10-2. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven players and members of coaching staff were ejected after a wild brawl broke out during the Minnesota Timberwolves' 123-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons in the NBA.
 <br>
  <br>
  A testy duel between the two sides at the Target Center in Minneapolis erupted into chaos early in the second quarter when Minnesota's Naz Reid took exception to being bumped by Detroit's Ron Holland as he drove towards the basket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reid jabbed a finger angrily at Holland as the two players squared up after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It escalated rapidly, with players from both sides being sucked into the melee that spilled into the spectator seats at courtside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves' Donte DiVincenzo was in the thick of the uproar and tumbled backwards into the seating as a scrum of players and team officials grappled around him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protracted scrap lasted around a minute before tempers cooled and the officiating crew began to determine who was at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it was over, the Timberwolves' Reid and DiVincenzo – who could be seen with what looked like large scratch marks near his neck – were tossed along with the Pistons' Marcus Sasser, Isaiah Stewart and Holland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Pistons head coach J B Bickerstaff was also ejected while Minnesota's assistant coach Pablo Prigioni was also tossed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minnesota head coach Chris Finch later suggested Detroit's overly physical approach early in the game had triggered the flashpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for his view of the incident, Finch replied: "Two guys went at it, and then spilled over into the crowd which was super dangerous.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then obviously it just kept escalating, and escalating, mostly from their side to be honest with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought leading up to that the game was way too physical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a little lopsided in its physicality and I thought it was bound to happen. It just felt like it was coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew they were a super physical team. They hit you, they hold you...but I just thought it got to a point where players were going to take matters into their own hands, and you don't ever want that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit coach Bickerstaff, meanwhile, accused Prigioni of triggering the incident that saw them both ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was things said by their assistant coach," Bickerstaff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I'm in the same boat as my guys are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to defend each other and I'm not going to let people say belligerent things about my guys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And it's that simple. So he said what he said. He knows what he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, I didn't think it crossed the line to escalation of anything, but in that moment, I understand, you know, the refs' position."
  <br>
  <br>
  US media reported meanwhile that a young fan sitting at courtside who had been caught in the chaotic scrum was later presented with a Minnesota team jersey by Alex Rodriguez, the former Major League Baseball star who is now a part owner of the Timberwolves. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford's first goals for Aston Villa inspired a 3-0 win against Preston that sent his side into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 10 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rashford struck twice in the second half at Deepdale to end Preston's stubborn resistance before Jacob Ramsey wrapped up Villa's long-awaited return to the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa will face Crystal Palace, 3-0 winners at Fulham on Saturday, in the semi-finals at Wembley on the weekend of April 26 to 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revitalised since joining Villa on loan from Manchester United during the January transfer window, Rashford is beginning to show the form that made him one of England's brightest stars prior to his steep decline over the last two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid concerns over his attitude and off-field behaviour, Rashford was deemed expendable by United manager Ruben Amorim, after also clashing with former Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old hadn't scored since netting for United against Everton on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deployed in the central striker's role that often seemed to dent his confidence at United, Rashford was too dynamic for second-tier Preston to handle in the latest sign that his career might not be destined to end in disappointment after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's always nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues," Rashford said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I missed a lot of football before joining up with Villa. It's step by step. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now," he added. "We're very ambitious. We'll see where it takes us."
  <br>
  <br>
  While struggling United have been mired in turmoil, Rashford has benefited from moving to upwardly mobile Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester City came from behind to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for a record seventh consecutive season with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth, but victory came at a cost as Erling Haaland hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had seen a first-half penalty saved before Evanilson put the Cherries in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made amends by equalising four minutes into the second period before being forced off with an ankle injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, Omar Marmoush, took just two minutes to score the winner from a second assist by the impressive Nico O'Reilly as City booked a semi-final clash against Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven times in a row reaching semi-finals in the FA Cup – this is outstanding. This generation of players, they have done this," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have been a shadow of the side that won four consecutive Premier League titles this season and Guardiola said prior to the game that even FA Cup glory would not save a miserable season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' collapse in the Premier League began at Bournemouth back in November with a 2-1 defeat that kicked off a run of six defeats in eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola hailed the difference in attitude in his side between then and now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came here in November with the flip flops on against a team that if you don't compete, it is impossible," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In football you have to run," he added. "People say about my teams 'how good they play' but no, it is how much we run, how much we fight and for many games this season it didn't happen." (AFP)

    Mitchell magic as Cavs down Clippers to bag 60th win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell led from the front as the Cleveland Cavaliers bagged their 60th win of the NBA season with a 127-122 victory over the in-form Los Angeles Clippers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland talisman Mitchell finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in what Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson later described as his best performance of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's victory means Cleveland have reached 60 wins in a season for the first time since the 2009-2010 campaign, and for only the third time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  More significantly, the win leaves Cleveland four-and-a-half games clear of NBA champions Boston in the race for the number one seeding in the Eastern Conference playoffs with just seven regular season fixtures remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Atkinson said reaching 60 wins was beyond his expectations at the start of the campaign following a 48-victory season in 2023-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect 60 wins," Atkinson said. "My internal goal was 'Can we improve from last year?' That was kind of where my mind was. But for this team to take it to another level and kind of shatter that says a lot. And we're not done – we can still add to that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we've got to celebrate this," he continued. "It's not the end goal, but we should take a deep breath and celebrate 60 wins. It's so hard to do in this league. I'm really happy for the guys today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell received offensive support from Jarrett Allen with 25 points, while Evan Mobley added 22 and Darius Garland 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Atkinson reserved special praise for Mitchell, who was immense at both ends of the court for Cleveland, with four steals in addition to his points tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's at that kind of maturity and mental level where he can manipulate the game how he wants it," Atkinson said of the 28-year-old six-time NBA All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would argue that this was probably his best all around game all year," he added. "He did everything tonight and showed great leadership."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat left the Clippers in eighth position in the Western Conference, where they are locked in a ferocious dog-fight with Golden State and Minnesota for an automatic ticket into the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers are on 42-32 – the same record as the seventh-placed Timberwolves – with the Warriors sixth on 42-31 heading into the final two weeks of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the Western Conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots. (AFP)

    Bagnaia wins USA MotoGP after Márquez crash

<img alt="Francesco Bagnaia of Italy rides during the 2025 Grand Prix of the Americas at Circuit of The Americas. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798175_1_20250331060812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Francesco Bagnaia won an eventful Grand Prix of the Americas to end crash-victim Marc Márquez's perfect start to the MotoGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Six-time elite class champion Márquez was set fair to make it six wins out of six in Texas after romping to victories in the sprints and main races in Thailand, Argentina and Saturday's sprint in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a crash on lap nine did it for the Spanish superstar, gifting victory to his Ducati factory teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Márquez, on a Ducati satellite bike, took second for the sixth time to move one point clear of his older brother in the riders' standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fabio Di Giannantonio, on another Ducati satellite machine, came in third at the Circuit of the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia supplied Ducati with their 20th consecutive grand prix success, just two shy of Honda's historic benchmark of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was chaos before lights out with riders on the grid, their bikes equipped with wet tyres, all set for the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, with the changeable overcast conditions drying, pole-sitter Marc Márquez dramatically ran back to the pits to swop to a bike with slicks, triggering a domino effect as his grid rivals copied his example.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he had not sat on his bike Márquez did not break any rules, only causing mayhem, and a delayed start with a race reduced by one lap to 19 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one last twist to the pre-race drama, when Maverick Vinales, last year's winner, had to wheel his bike off the grid with an issue to start from the pits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez got away to a flyer when they were eventually let go to lead from Alex Márquez with Bagnaia up from sixth to third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez senior quickly stamped his authority on the race with more than a one second cushion over the chasing pack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia moved up to second after eight laps, albeit over two seconds behind the rider who lists the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) as one of his favourite tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the race was turned on its head when Márquez crashed on lap nine, slithering off his bike after touching a kerb.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejoined in 18th place with 10 laps remaining, only to call it a day a couple of laps later.
  <br>
  <br>
  One frustrated bystander at COTA was world champion Jorge Martin who has missed the opening three rounds after breaking his right hand and foot in pre-season testing crash in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has delayed his title defence and his debut for Aprilia. He moved to the team after being overlooked by Ducati for the factory ride that was offered to Márquez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard faces a seemingly Herculean task though to defend his title when he resumes in Qatar next time out, lagging 87 points behind Alex Márquez on his belated seasonal bow, with Marc Márquez on 86, and Bagnaia third on 75 points. (AFP)

<img alt="Lewandowski scored twice as Barca remain unbeaten this year in 20 matches. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798174_1_20250331055012.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert Lewandowski bagged a brace as Barcelona eased to a 4-1 victory over Girona to move three points clear at the top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  After second-placed Real Madrid pulled level on points with them on Saturday by beating Leganes, Hansi Flick's side restored their advantage at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewandowski responded to Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe's double with one of his own to stay three goals ahead in the race for Spain's golden boot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, unbeaten this year in 20 matches, took the lead through a Ladislav Krejci own goal near the end of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arnaut Danjuma pulled Girona level but Lewandowski netted twice and Ferran Torres finished off the rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game," veteran striker Lewandowski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old said he had the legs to keep playing for seasons to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know a lot of people are talking abut my age but I want to play more years at the top level," said the Poland international. "I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona beat Barcelona twice last season but have struggled to hit those heights again and sit 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were superior," admitted Girona coach Michel Sanchez. "There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth. Barcelona dream of titles every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick rotated some of his usual suspects with the Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were below their free-flowing best in the first half despite dominating, occasionally threatening through the dynamic running of teenage star Lamine Yamal and frantic energy of Fermin Lopez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona wanted a penalty when Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla on the edge of the box and a free-kick was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review showed the contact was inside the area but the referee decided Lopez fouled Asprilla as they came together, much to Barcelona's chagrin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Gazzaniga produced a sensational save with his fingertips to push out a Ronald Araujo header but Barca found a way through before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal's dangerous free-kick aimed at Eric Garcia was deflected into his own net by Krejci at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona had produced very little of note in the first half but were back level eight minutes into the second through Danjuma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daley Blind played the Dutch striker through and he beat Wojciech Szczesny with a clinical low finish. However, Barcelona were swiftly back in front as La Liga's top goalscorer Lewandowski notched his 24th of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopez nodded the ball across the six-yard box and Lewandowski contorted his body to reach it and flick it between Gazzaniga's legs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward secured Barcelona's victory with his 25th, slotting home after substitute Frenkie de Jong pushed forward into space and fed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was time for Torres to add a fourth after Gerard Martin found him and for the brilliant Yamal to bend a strike against the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was remarkably the 20th time this season Flick's side have scored four goals or more from 45 games, with a potential treble in their sights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that," Flick told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, fourth-place Athletic Bilbao were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Osasuna, allowing Villarreal to cut the gap on them to six points after beating Getafe 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Betis, sixth, won their sixth game in a row to stay on Villarreal's tail, beating rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valencia's 1-0 win over Mallorca took them 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina on Sunday captured the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens for the first time, defeating France in a hard-fought men's final at the Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to break through in a defensive-minded first half, which finished 0-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second half, tries from Santiago Alvarez and Marcos Moneta in quick succession, and an ensuing conversion, put Argentina up 12-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gregoire Arfeuil of France scored a last-minute try but it was too little, too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-7 win gave Argentina their third straight title in the World Series, having also come out on top in Perth and Vancouver.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended their lead atop the standings to 12 points ahead of Fiji on 88 points entering the Singapore Sevens next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee presented the winning trophy to Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez, playing for his country for the 14th season, said it wasn't just about winning but also the connections he has built with his teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Difficult to describe what we're feeling, what we did [as] a team," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The connection we have, really, really happy and proud of this team. I will always say thank you to this team because for me, it's all I have in my life."
  <br>
  <br>
  While there was a bigger contingent of French fans at the Kai Tak Stadium, their team were unable to repeat the magic when they put away two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Zealand women's team had better luck, defeating archrivals Australia in the final 26-19 for their third straight crown in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides went back and forth for much of the game, before Jorja Miller scored two tries for the Black Ferns in the second half to open up a 14-point margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Mackenzie Davis scored late to add to two tries from teammate Maddison Levi, but their efforts came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means everything... this puts us in a good place for the world series title as well so, I'm really stoked about it," New Zealand captain Sarah Hirini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Ferns now have 96 points in the World Series standings, eight more than Australia ahead of the trip to Singapore for the final stop on the Sevens calendar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the SAR men's and women's teams won an invitational in style at the first Hong Kong Sevens at Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local squads drew some of the loudest cheers from an electric home crowd, as the men's team successfully defended their Melrose Claymore title.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the final against the national team, Hong Kong, China conceded a try in the first half but quickly bounced back, racing to a 14-5 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR scored three more tries against China after the break to come away 35-5 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Max Denmark scored one of those second-half tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just saw the ball in front of me and the try line's so close, so all I can think of was I've got to get over there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scoring at home, in this stadium, hearing the crowd is the best feeling on the planet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's team took advantage of a Kazakhstan player being sent off in the first half to score a 45-5 victory in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne scored a try for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're going through, there's a moment when you break through and you're like, am I in the clear? And you're like, yes, yes I am. And I could hear (teammate) Chong Ka-yan behind me going, you've got this, keep going," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's good to have that confidence from the team, to know that they back you, it's quite special."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR co-captain Chloe Chan hailed the win, calling it a total team effort, adding that they now turn their focus to the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China women's squad improved from their runners-up finish a year ago.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.
  <br>

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.
   <br>
   <br>

    Brett Muntz, who grew up in Fiji and now lives in New Zealand, stuck to his roots and supports the Flying Fijians.
    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."
    <br>

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."
     <br>
     <br>
     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

      "The dedication we've put in is really great, because we have to put paint on us. I think we have the best costume," said one of them.

       Others drew inspiration from Freddy, an animated weatherman on local TV.
       <br>
       <br>
       The group said they planned for their costume one month or two ago, and chose one relating to rainy conditions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's emphatic run at the Hong Kong Sevens continued on Sunday as they scored a dramatic, nail-biting victory over Fiji to book a place in the final where they will battle Argentina.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French had knocked out two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar to that game, France fell behind against Fiji, but they quickly bounced back to take a 10-7 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides then went back-and-forth before the final play that went in favour of France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The referee called for video review over Matteo Garcia's try, eventually ruling it was successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won 24-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina booked the other berth in the final by defeating Australia 31-7, thanks in part to a hat-trick of tries from German Schulz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither France nor Argentina have won the title before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, New Zealand's quest for a third consecutive title is very much alive as they crushed Canada 41-0 in the semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  They'll meet rivals Australia in the title showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jazmin Felix-Hotham scored two tries as New Zealand put the game out of reach in the first half, leading 26-0 at intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other semis, Maddison Levi's hat-trick helped Australia to a 28-5 victory over France.

    Sabalenka beats Pegula to take Miami Open

<img alt="The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798090_1_20250330101920.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka powered her way to the Miami Open title on Saturday, beating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event at Hard Rock Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami and her second of the season following her January triumph in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost the final at Indian Wells to Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva earlier this month, Sabalenka was determined not to fall at the last hurdle again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final," said Sabalenka, who paid tribute to Pegula's performance after repeating her win over her from last year's US Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players struggled to hold their serve in the first set, which saw seven breaks of serve, with Pegula causing Sabalenka some trouble when she brought her up to the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the momentum shifted when Pegula was serving to stay in the set at 6-5 down and Sabalenka turned it on, producing a delicate forehand drop and then a superb down the line winner to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once she recovered from being broken on her first service game of the second set, it was easier going for Sabalenka, whose bid for a third straight Australian Open title was thwarted in the Melbourne final by Madison Keys earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka broke twice to go 3-1 up and never looked in danger from that point on as she wrapped up the win in one hour 27 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her last 14 matches against top 10 players, Sabalenka has won 12 and she credited her ability in the clutch moments for her record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the third time that Pegula has faced Sabalenka in a final and she has lost on all three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best," Pegula conceded after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her," she added
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pegula, the world number four, said she was pleased to again have been a serious contender in a tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Sabalenka has now won eight WTA 1000 titles and 19 titles on the WTA Tour overall - 17 of which have come on hard courts including all three of her Grand Slam singles titles -- the 2023 Australian Open, the 2024 Australian Open and the 2024 US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  She looks a calmer, more focused, presence on court than in her earlier seasons when she was capable of bouts of rage when the going got tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka said that her struggles in the past with her serve had allowed her to develop a stronger all-round game and more positive mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's final on Sunday will feature Novak Djokovic up against Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik with the Serb looking for his 100th professional title. (AFP)

 Ending a 70-year wait for a domestic trophy deserves an official party.
 <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle will get one on Saturday when the team holds an open-top bus parade to celebrate their English League Cup title.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 150,000 fans are expected to join the celebration. The parade route runs from St James’ Park, through the city centre and ends at the Town Moor, an open space where a stage has been erected for an hour-long event that will include comments from players and a trophy lift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi-backed team beat Liverpool 2-1 nearly two weeks ago at Wembley Stadium for their first major domestic trophy since the FA Cup in 1955. The club also won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – a European competition – in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus was scheduled to set off from the stadium at 4:30 pm local time.

  Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has been nominated for a municipal honour called the "Freedom of the City." Club legends who have received the recognition include Alan Shearer, Bobby Robson and Shaka Hislop. (AP)

<img alt="Tim Hardaway Jr connected on seven of 11 from three-point range for Detroit. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798019_1_20250329151714.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Hardaway Jr scored 32 points to lead Detroit to a 133-122 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, a triumph that assured the Pistons of their first winning NBA season since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hardaway connected on seven of 11 from three-point range on the way to his season-high, leading seven Pistons players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included Ausar Thompson with 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder with 17 points and 10 assists as Detroit improved to 42-32 – tripling their win total from last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had to do it without Cade Cunningham, who missed a third straight game with a bruised calf, and Tobias Harris, who was a late scratch with Achilles tendon trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons withstood a 38-point performance from Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, who helped the Cavs erase a 21-point deficit to close within two with 3:31 to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit responded with a 12-1 run to seal the win, which most importantly pushed their lead for fifth place in the East to one and a half games over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 116-107 to the New York Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  OG Anunoby scored 20 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter for the Knicks, who handed the Bucks a third straight defeat despite 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists from Giannis Antetokounmpo – who returned after missing one game with a foot sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State superstar Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his return from a two-game absence with a pelvic contusion, lifting the Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the Pelicans in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors got off to a sluggish start against the struggling Pelicans, who were without Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Curry scored 13 points in the second quarter to help the Warriors keep it close despite woeful shooting from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he thought Curry "looked great" and his team as a whole looked better as the game went on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't love the passing in the first half, but we took care of the ball better in the second half," Kerr said. "All in all a positive outcome, a positive effort on a night where we're clearly trying to get our rhythm back as a group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors picked things up on both ends of the floor in the second half. Jimmy Butler added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State, who remained seventh in the West and battling to avoid the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers remained in sixth – the final spot for direct entry to the playoffs – after a 132-100 victory over the Nets in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers and Warriors have the same 42-31 record, the Clippers holding the head-to-head record tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves are just half a game back in eighth after a 124-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard scored 31 points to lead the Clippers, connecting on five of six three-point attempts and 10 of 14 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added six rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocks, and Ivica Zubac added 21 points on perfect nine-for-nine shooting as the Clippers notched their 10th win in their last 12 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Denver Nuggets, fuelled by 27 points and 14 rebounds from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, cruised past the Utah Jazz 129-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver led from start to finish, Jokic and the rest of their starters sitting out the fourth quarter of the rout. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.
