<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United and Tottenham both enjoyed some much needed respite from their Premier League woes with victories in the Europa League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes conjured up the injury time winner in United's 2-1 defeat of Scottish giants Rangers, while in Germany Son Heung-min scored twice in a 3-2 win for Spurs at Hoffenheim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both English teams closed in on direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils looked set to suffer more disappointment at Old Trafford when Cyriel Dessers levelled for an injury-ravaged Rangers in the 88th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Scottish side had fallen behind when goalkeeper Jack Butland punched the ball into his own net early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes spared United's blushes and possibly the playoff round by blasting home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  United were earlier controversially denied a goal when Matthijs de Ligt's towering header was ruled out for a foul on Robin Propper and VAR did not intervene.
  <br>
  <br>
  United move up to fourth in the table with one match of the league phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight will qualify directly for the last 16, which may now be beyond Rangers who slip to 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs are sixth in the revamped league phase format topped by Lazio, who beat Real Sociedad 3-1 to ensure their ticket to the knock out stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Ferencvaros 2-0, are placed second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Son and James Maddison took some of the heat off Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou whose team have lost seven of their last nine Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou had pledged to win silverware for the first time for the London side since 2008 in his second season as boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Spurs struggling in 15th behind Liverpool at home that leaves the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup to fulfil his promise.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Swedish outfit Elfsborg in their closing league phase game at home next week will give them an automatic ticket to the next round as one of the top eight finishers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I told them to enjoy it," Postecoglou said. "Winning away in Europe, it's a significant victory for us and gives us a good foothold to get into those top eight spots which will give us a week off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham charged out of the stalls with Maddison receiving a pinpoint pass from Pedro Porro to fire the ball past keeper Oliver Baumann and into the roof of the net to give Spurs the perfect start after just four minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richarlison, making only his second start of the campaign, could have doubled the advantage but the Brazilian's shot went straight to Baumann.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attacking at will Spurs were looking to put the game to bed against their out of sorts German hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on 22 minutes Maddison turned provider to set up Son whose shot deflected off a defender, the ball flying over Baumann and into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The big problem for Spurs given their leaky defence was to hold onto their superiority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brandon Austin started in goal for them, two weeks after making his debut, and was called on to make a full-stretch save to deny Tom Bischof as half-time beckoned.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the wind in their sails Hoffenheim halved their deficit minutes later when Spurs got caught on the counter, Anton Stach toeing the ball past Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Son's angled shot with 13 minutes left on the clock settled the issue, although David Mokwa's goal two minutes from normal time meant another nerve-jangling ending for Tottenham's long-suffering supporters. (AFP)

<img alt="Real Madrid celebrates after a goal against Austrian side RB Salzburg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788763_2_20250123073826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain pushed Manchester City to the brink of Champions League elimination after coming from two goals down to win 4-2, while Arsenal all but secured their place in the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holders Real Madrid remain in contention for a top-eight spot after sweeping aside Red Bull Salzburg 5-1, but Bayern Munich's hopes of automatic qualification took a hit with a 3-0 defeat by Feyenoord.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's City were left stunned as they blew a two-goal lead after Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland struck early in the second half in pouring rain at the Parc des Princes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Ousmane Dembele soon halved the deficit for PSG and Bradley Barcola equalised on the hour after Desire Doue's effort came back off the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Neves' diving header put PSG on top before Gonçalo Ramos added a late fourth as the French champions climbed from 26th in the table to 22nd and bumped City out of the qualifying spots for the knockout phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how we did it, to be honest," PSG coach Luis Enrique said after the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started the second half in the worst way possible by conceding two goals," he added. "It was tricky at that point, but at the same time this team believes in itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, the European champions in 2023, are down in 25th having failed to win any of their last four games in the competition and must beat Club Brugge at home next week to salvage their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept the defeat because the best team won," said Guardiola. "It's in our hands, we have to win the last game. Hopefully we can qualify. If it doesn't happen, we don't deserve it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, holders Real Madrid got back on track in Europe with a 5-1 victory over RB Salzburg to ensure they will not be eliminated at the first hurdle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes struck twice each with French superstar Kylian Mbappé also on target in a ruthless display at the Santiago Bernabeu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side lost three of their first six games in a worrying start to the competition and will likely have to compete in the extra play-off round in February which is part of the competition's new format, unless they can scrape a top-eight spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory left Los Blancos 16th, a point behind Bayer Leverkusen in eighth, which is the final spot for direct qualification to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazilian winger Rodrygo struck twice in the first half to help Madrid take control, with Mbappé netting soon after the break and Vinicius grabbing a brace of his own to bring up a century of goals for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy after reaching 100 goals with this shirt," Vinicius told Movistar, noting he was close to Brazilian compatriot Ronaldo Nazario's tally of 104.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope to be able to continue like this and score a lot of goals, and mark an era in this team – that's my dream," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeats by Liverpool, AC Milan and Lille put Madrid under pressure ahead of their final two group matches and their Austrian visitors started with vim, pinning back Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid created little of note until Rodrygo's opener after 23 minutes changed the dynamic of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, in sensational form in recent weeks with eight goals in his last nine games across all competitions, finished neatly after Jude Bellingham nudged a cross into his path at the back post.
  <br>
  <br>
  His second goal was even better, set up by Bellingham with a brilliant backheel, which Rodrygo finished first time with a crisp curling strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so easy to play with Jude, he makes everything easy, the movements he makes, his second assist was very nice and I love playing with him," said Rodrygo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Arsenal moved within touching distance of the last 16 after Declan Rice's goal in just 106 seconds inspired their 3-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have won five of their seven league phase matches, losing just once, and are almost certain to finish in the top eight, which secures automatic qualification for the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners, who have never won the Champions League, travel to Girona for their last match in the group phase. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Guangdong have defended their title at the annual Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition, after beating the SAR on aggregate following a 2-1 win on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two sides had settled for a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Guangzhou a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg was played at the Hong Kong Stadium in front of thousands of home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first shot on target for Hong Kong, China came shortly after the kick-off, although Mahama Awal’s attempt from the box was comfortably saved by Guangdong goalkeeper Zhao Shi.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Guangdong who struck first, when national team player Behram Abduweli scored with a narrow angle shot in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Things got slightly heated after the goal, as Abduweli celebrated by taking off his shirt in front of the home crowd, triggering some Hong Kong fans to throw things at him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR side later suffered another blow when they had to make an early substitution after Awal got injured. Ma Hei-wai replaced him.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the hosts responded swiftly after half-time as Lau Ka-kiu made a quick run into the box and to score an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team continued their attack and created multiple scoring chances, including a one-two play between Ma and Wu Chun-ming that led to a shot by Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xia Dalong put Guangdong ahead again in the 85th minute with a stunning header that caught Hong Kong goalkeeper Ng Wai-him off guard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad made a final effort to level the game in stoppage time, but captain Stefan Pereira’s free kick was again denied by the Guangdong goalkeeper.

    Ichiro becomes first Japanese into MLB Hall of Fame

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ichiro Suzuki, whose uncanny hitting talent made him a Seattle Mariners icon after he'd established himself as a star in Japan, has become the first Japanese player elected to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro headlines the 2025 Hall of Fame class to be enshrined at Cooperstown, New York, which also includes pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player, as opposed to a pitcher, to play in the US major leagues.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won both American League Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year honors that year, going on to earn 10 All-Star nods, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger Awards.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished his career with 3,089 hits in MLB – on top of 1,278 he piled up in nine years in Japan. His 4,367 hits as a professional are the most of any player in baseball history.
  <br>
  <br>
  He amassed two batting titles, 1,420 runs and 509 stolen bases in more than 19 Major League seasons while expanding the horizons for Japanese players aiming to make the move Stateside when some still doubted that their skills would translate to MLB.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2004 Ichiro won his second batting title and broke George Sisler's 84-year-old record with 262 hits – part of a stretch of 10 straight seasons with at least 200 hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first year of eligibility, the 51-year-old Ichiro fell one ballot shy of unanimous election – something achieved to date only by Yankees pitching great Mariano Rivera. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool beat Lille 2-1 to maintain their perfect record in this season's Champions League and clinch qualification for the last 16, while Barcelona produced a stunning comeback to beat Benfica 5-4 in a classic to secure their own place.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Anfield side are the only team with a maximum 21 points from seven matches in this new, expanded Champions League and they now know they will skip next month's play-offs and head straight to the last 16 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah ran clear to give Liverpool the lead at home to a Lille team who have also impressed this season, and the visitors appeared in trouble when they had Aissa Mandi sent off just before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan David swept in an equaliser for Lille, but Harvey Elliott's shot took a wicked deflection on its way in to give Liverpool the points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy that we are top eight. That's the only thing that tells me something, because this league table doesn't tell you anything," said Slot when asked about being through to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the biggest drama on the night, however, came in the rain in Lisbon, where Barcelona trailed 4-2 with 12 minutes of the 90 remaining, but somehow recovered to win 5-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greek striker Vangelis Pavlidis scored a hat-trick in the first half-hour for Benfica, including a penalty, while Robert Lewandowski netted from the spot for Barca, who were 3-1 down at the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha pulled it back to 3-2 when a clearance by the goalkeeper ricocheted back off the Brazilian's head and in, but a Ronald Araujo own goal midway through the second half appeared to have secured the win for the Portuguese side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, another Lewandowski penalty on 78 minutes gave Barcelona renewed hope, and Eric Garcia headed in the equaliser on 86 minutes, before Raphinha ran away to settle an incredible game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The mentality of the team, they always believe in themselves and this was unbelievable to see," said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans are second with six wins out of seven, and will finish in the top eight to go straight to the last 16. Benfica, with 10 points, must still sweat to reach the play-off round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Atlético Madrid are third on 15 points and certain to at least be in the play-offs after a Julián Alvarez brace secured a 2-1 home victory over Bayer Leverkusen in a game both teams finished with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico had Pablo Barrios sent off midway through the first half, and Piero Hincapie then put Leverkusen ahead just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina star Alvarez levelled seven minutes into the second half, and Hincapie was sent off for the Germans before another Alvarez goal won it for the home side in the last minute as they climbed above Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's Europa League winners Atalanta are also guaranteed at least a play-off place after crushing Sturm Graz of Austria 5-0. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A vintage Novak Djokovic tamed Carlos Alcaraz in a late-night blockbuster to set up an Australian Open semi-final with Alexander Zverev as two-time women's defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fought on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Djokovic rolled back the years at the scene of his greatest achievements on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph sealed close to 1:00 am.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb surged into the semi-finals and a date with world number two Zverev to edge closer to an 11th Melbourne crown and all-time record 25th Slam title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just wish that this match today was the final," said Djokovic, who had to have his thigh heavily strapped and appeared to be labouring at the end of the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just one of the most epic matches I have played on this court, any court really," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  With former rival Andy Murray now in his coaching corner, Djokovic was at his imperious and defiant best, cupping his ear to the crowd after winning big points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic was at the centre of a row on Monday after he demanded an apology – and got one – from a local TV presenter for what he called "insulting and offensive comments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's world number three Alcaraz will have to wait another year to get a kangaroo tattoo. He had vowed to get one if he won the Australian Open for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old four-time major champion has still never been beyond the Melbourne Park last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  He felt he should have rammed home the advantage when Djokovic was struggling with his movement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to say that was the biggest mistake that I made today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former number one Djokovic extended his career advantage over Alcaraz to 5-3, having also beaten him in the Paris Olympics final in their last meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz got the better of his rival in the 2023 and 2024 Wimbledon finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot and windy conditions, Germany's Zverev defeated the American Tommy Paul 7-6 (7/1), 7-6 (7/0), 2-6, 6-1 to step up his quest to win a Grand Slam for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old lost his cool at one point because of a feather. The umpire called for a replay when the feather drifted in front of him as he played a shot at a critical juncture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "C'mon, that is unbelievable on break point," he shouted, before taking out his fury on Paul by breaking to love.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner plays home hope Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, the winner facing American 21st seed Ben Shelton or the unseeded Italian Lorenzo Sonego.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Sabalenka will face Paula Badosa in the last four as the Belarusian bids to win the Australian Open for a third time in a row, something last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number one kept that dream alive but had to battle for it in beating Russian 27th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the wind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly I was just praying, trying to put the ball back in these tough conditions," said Sabalenka. "I'm just super happy I was able to somehow magically win this match." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host the World Snooker Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Arena, the first ranking tournament to be held in the city since 1989.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tournament will take place from March 4 to 9, featuring the top 32 players from around the world including Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan, who will be playing on home turf for the first time after becoming Hong Kong residents through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other snooker greats set to be in action include China's top player Ding Junhui, former World champions Mark Selby of England and Australian Neil Robertson, and the current World champion Kyren Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will be the first formal sport event to be held in Kai Tak Arena, so there will be a lot of challenges because I don't think anyone in Hong Kong has the experience of organising something of this scale in this venue," said Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are working on every single detail meticulously, especially the production, the seating plan, the scenery, the facilities for example the media room, the media centre, the other rooms for the players, a lot of things. It's not an easy task, but we are trying our best."
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also the first time Hong Kong will host the World Snooker Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Brownell, CEO of the World Snooker Tour, said it'll be a treat for both the fans and the players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be desperate to become the first to lift the historic World Grand Prix trophy in Hong Kong, and to win the historic highs prize money for this event," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the local fans, it will be incredible opportunity to watch the best players on the planet and marvel at their skills. We are sure the atmosphere will be electric and it will be a fabulous experience for everyone inside the arena."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the event, exhibition matches will be held for other elite players, including local favourite Marco Fu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said it promises to be a great tournament that would further promote snooker in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking back, many years ago I went to Queen Elizabeth Stadium to watch the likes of Steve Davis, Jimmy White, they played in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, and that's when I really fell in love with the game of snooker," Fu told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure many youngsters will come to this tournament to watch all the top players playing, and I'm sure they're going to fall in love with the game of snooker.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After this tournament, more youngsters will pick up the cue and start to play snooker. It's going to be fantastic."

    Badosa stuns Gauff to reach Aussie Open semi-finals

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An "emotional" Paula Badosa shattered world number three Coco Gauff's dream of a first Australian Open title when she stunned her 7-5, 6-4 in the quarter-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Badosa reached a Slam semi-final for the first time in her career -- the first Spanish woman to do so since Garbine Muguruza at Melbourne in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a bit emotional," said Badosa, who will face either two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a very emotional person. I wanted to play my best game. I think I did it – I'm super proud of the level I gave today," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a remarkable comeback to tennis for the 11th seed, who was ranked outside the top 100 a year ago after a stress fracture in her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I mean, a year ago, I was here with my back that I didn't know if I had to retire from this sport, and now I'm here playing against the best in the world," said Badosa. "I won today. I'm in a semi final. So I would never think that a year after I would be here."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third seed Gauff had been unbeaten in nine matches this season, but dropped her first set of 2025 before recovering to beat Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Belinda Bencic in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa began aggressively and had the Gauff serve under pressure early in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff was serving at 5-5 30-40 when the Spaniard got the breakthrough on her third break-point opportunity and served out to take the opener in 56 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American, uncharacteristically, failed to create any break points in the first set and littered her game with unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Badosa was relentless at the start of the second set in a marathon first game that lasted for 14 minutes and went to eight deuces. Gauff saved four break points but a fifth proved costly as the American went long to drop her serve again.
  <br>
  <br>
  A rasping running forehand winner and a backhand at the net put Gauff on the board and fired her up as broke back to level at 2-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Badosa powered to another two breaks and secured the match in one hour and 43 minutes, falling to the court in celebration as she registered her first win over a top-10 opponent at a Grand Slam in four attempts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reigning NBA champions Boston Celtics crushed the Golden State Warriors 125-85 as current league leaders Cleveland romped past the Phoenix Suns.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tatum scored 22 points with nine rebounds and seven assists before sitting out the entire fourth quarter of the Celtics' dominant victory in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kristaps Porzingis added 18 points and Jaylen Brown chipped in 17 for Boston, who took full advantage of the absence of Draymond Green, the latest Warriors injury victim after he strained his left calf on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Those are some of the tricky games in the NBA, when teams have some star players out, other guys get a different role," Tatum said. "We fell victim to that a couple of times this year, so we were just trying to lock in from the beginning."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up by 15 at halftime, the Celtics erupted for 43 points in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Curry scored 18 points to lead the Warriors and Moses Moody added 13 off the bench – the only Golden State players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was just one of the lopsided results as the NBA marked the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday with a day-long slate of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to fuel the Cavaliers in a 118-92 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury absences of Evan Mobley, Isaac Okoro and Caris LeVert did nothing to slow the Cavs, who led by as many as 32 on the way to boosting their league-best record to 36-6.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest thing was this was a group effort," Mitchell said. "Everybody contributed at a high level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Durant scored 33 points with seven rebounds to lead the Suns, but Devin Booker – who had scored at least 30 points in the Suns' last five games – was held to 15 points on six-of-14 shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jaren Jackson Jr. scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to help the Memphis Grizzlies rally from a 16-point deficit to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 108-106.
  <br>
  <br>
  Desmond Bane added 22 points and Ja Morant scored 19 for Memphis, who were still down by five going into the fourth quarter and took their first lead of the second half on Bane's floater in the lane with 3:21 remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was ugly from the start, but we kept competing and found a way down the stretch," Bane said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 32 points to lead the Timberwolves, but missed a potential game-winning three-pointer as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, New York's Jalen Brunson scored 34 points to propel the Knicks to a 119-110 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trae Young scored 27 points, leading seven Hawks players to score in double figures, but Atlanta saw their three-game winning streak end.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte, LaMelo Ball and Miles Bridges scored 23 points apiece as the Hornets used a balanced scoring effort to hold off Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks 110-105.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving scored 14 of his 33 points in the final frame and Daniel Gafford finished with a career-high 31 points and 15 rebounds, but with Luka Doncic still sidelined by a calf injury, the Mavericks lost for the fourth time in their last five games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City have announced the signing of Uzbekistan centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov from French club Lens for a reported fee of US$42 million plus add-ons.
 <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov, the first player from Uzbekistan to join a Premier League club, has signed a four-and-a-half year deal at the Etihad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This squad is full of the best players in the world and I can't wait to meet them and play alongside them," said the 20-year-old, who has 18 international caps.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And of course Pep Guardiola is one of the greatest coaches ever and I am so excited to learn from him and improve my game even more," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For such a young defender, Abdukodir is already very intelligent, as well as being strong, aggressive and extremely quick," City's director of football Txiki Begiristain said. "Working with Pep will only make him better and, speaking to him, he is determined to keep improving."
  <br>
  <br>
  Khusanov's deal keeps him at the Etihad until the end of the 2028 to 2029 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier League champions City are fourth in the table after a 6-0 win at Ipswich on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The signing gives Guardiola's team much-needed defensive reinforcement after an injury-hit season. (AFP)

<img alt="Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella scored the second goal for Enzo Maresca's side. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788418_1_20250121070942.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea overcame a howler from goalkeeper Robert Sánchez to beat relegation-threatened Wolves 3-1, ending a five-game winless run to climb back into the Premier League's top four.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's team were just two points behind leaders Liverpool in mid-December, raising hopes of an unlikely title challenge before losing their way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now they are back on track to qualify for next season's Champions League after second-half goals from Marc Cucurella and Noni Madueke spared Sánchez's blushes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish goalkeeper had dropped the ball moments before half-time, allowing Matt Doherty to cancel out Tosin Adarabioyo's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca said Chelsea had dominated the first 40 minutes before problems that have haunted them in recent weeks returned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We lost a little bit of confidence, we conceded a goal and we started to struggle a little bit and then the second half I think we started quite well and then after the second and third goals the game was in control," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past five games we didn't win but I said many times that the performance was there," he added. "We created many chances, we didn't score and tonight finally we scored three goals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's top-scorer Cole Palmer, a doubt before the game, was fit to start as Maresca made five changes from last week's draw against Bournemouth including bringing in centre-back Trevoh Chalobah, recalled from his loan spell at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side dominated possession in the early stages and Palmer had a couple of early efforts, curling one wide and forcing José Sá into a diving save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were rewarded for their dominance midway through the first half when Adarabioyo fired home for his first Premier League goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defender controlled the ball well after it was deflected into his path from Reece James's shot from the edge of the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of Chelsea players were in offside positions in a crowded penalty area and the flag was raised but the on-field decision was overturned after a VAR check. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen scored two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills punished a slew of mistakes to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 27-25 and set up a blockbuster NFL playoff clash with the Kansas City Chiefs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bills quarterback Allen barged over for two first-half rushing touchdowns at a snowy Highmark Stadium in New York as the Baltimore opposite number Lamar Jackson and the Ravens were left ruing a string of costly errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors had a golden chance to tie the game with less than two minutes remaining, but tight end Mark Andrews fluffed a simple catch attempting a two-point conversion to effectively seal the Bills win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How about that Buffalo Bills defence?" Allen said afterwards. "All year we heard this team has no talent, we're too small, we can't stop the run? We're not good enough to compete?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just put our head down and worked hard," he added. "I'm so proud of our defence."
  <br>
  <br>
  The AFC divisional round battle had been hyped as a duel between two of the most dynamic quarterbacks in the NFL, pitting this season's Most Valuable Player front-runner Allen against the Ravens' reigning MVP Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the quarterback shoot-out largely failed to materialise in a gritty contest that ultimately pivoted on the Ravens' mistakes at key times. A Jackson fumble following a sack by Damar Hamlin led to Allen's opening touchdown in the second quarter that put the Bills 14-7 ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen then scored his second rushing touchdown in the closing moments of the first half to help put the Bills 21-10 up at the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens threatened a comeback with a field goal and a Derrick Henry touchdown in the third quarter that cut the Bills lead to three points. But another Ravens turnover in the fourth quarter, Andrews fumbling under pressure led to a Bills field goal that stretched the hosts lead to 27-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore hit back with a superb Isaiah Likely touchdown from Jackson's 24-yard bullet pass, but with overtime looming, Andrews botched the two-point conversion attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills will now meet Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City in next week's AFC Championship game, with the winner advancing to the February 9 Super Bowl in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the latest instalment of a fierce rivalry between the two teams, who have met three times in the playoffs since 2021 – the Chiefs winning them all. The Bills, however, were one of only two teams to beat the Chiefs in the regular season this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to enjoy this tonight and then turn our attention to the Chiefs tomorrow," said Allen. "They're the perennial of what you want to be in the NFL – you've got to beat them to get past them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, running back sensation Saquon Barkley rushed for two long-range solo touchdowns as the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Los Angeles Rams 28-22 to reach the NFC Championship game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles will host NFC East divisional rivals the Washington Commanders next week for a place in the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia's power in the running game proved decisive in a game played in heavy snow with Barkley, a candidate for the league's Most Valuable Player, putting up 205 yards on 26 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even before the snow began to fall late in the first quarter, the Eagles exposed the Rams' run defence, opening the scoring on the opening drive of the game when quarterback Jalen Hurts broke out and sprinted 44 yards for the touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams fought back quickly though with quarterback Matthew Stafford leading a 13-play, 67-yard drive which ended with a four-yard touchdown pass to tight-end Tyler Higbee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles had spent all week preparing for the threat of Barkley, but they were still unable to stop him when he found a gap and sprinted 62 yards to put the Eagles up 13-7 at the end of the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles extended their lead with two field goals in the fourth before Barkley turned on the turbo chargers again with just over four minutes left, with the snow showing no obstacle to his power and speed as he burst 78 yards for his second touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rams threatened a remarkable comeback with a quick Colby Parkinson touchdown, but a last gasp drive for a go-ahead touchdown faltered. (AFP)

<img alt="Mbappé celebrates after scoring Real Madrid's first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788254_1_20250120081151.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck twice and produced a brilliant performance to power Real Madrid to a 4-1 win over Las Palmas and take the reigning champions top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Los Blancos enjoyed a perfect weekend, overtaking Atlético Madrid by two points after their neighbours slipped up with a shock defeat at Leganes on Saturday, while Barcelona, third, could only draw at Getafe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has hit top form in recent weeks after an inconsistent start to life at Real Madrid following his dream switch from Paris Saint-Germain last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old reached 12 league goals with his brace, becoming the Spanish league's second top-scorer behind Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski, with Brahim Díaz and Rodrygo Goes also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a very important game because we knew what had happened yesterday, with Atletico and Barca, we wanted to win and we did," Mbappé said. "We started badly, letting in a goal so early – but the reaction was top."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got the ball forward, quickly, attacking the spaces and with quality, we scored a lot of goals," he added. "We're happy because we're leaders."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has 18 goals for the season in 30 appearances across all competitions, and is looking increasingly crucial for his side in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinicius Junior suspended, the spotlight was on the French forward at the Santiago Bernabeu and he delivered with a sparkling performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very happy, I have adapted to the team and I can play how I want, with my team-mates, with personality," continued Mbappé. "I think that we are all enjoying it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were thrashed by Barcelona last week in the Spanish Super Cup final, leading to some whistles for the team when they played at home in midweek in the Copa del Rey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé posted on social media network Instagram to encourage the fans to stick together and support the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we have to be united, and like that, we can go for all the trophies," he explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was questioned over his positioning of Mbappé earlier in the season, using the striker through the middle instead of on the left, where Vinicius plays and Mbappé often did at PSG.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the best central striker in the world," said Ancelotti. "He's a great forward, he's very comfortable in the middle, more than on the wing, his ability to get away from players is unique and inside he can take better advantage of that." (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester United's 3-1 defeat to Brighton was their 10th loss of the season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788244_1_20250120054447.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United slumped to a 3-1 defeat at home to Brighton as Old Trafford remembered the legendary Denis Law, while Tottenham's troubles also persist after they lost 3-2 at Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest maintained an unlikely title challenge with a 3-2 victory over Southampton to take Nuno Espirito Santo's men level with second-placed Arsenal and within six points of Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, by contrast, are 24 points adrift of the leaders and focused on mere survival after Brighton stormed Old Trafford for the third consecutive season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's men looked to have turned a corner after a thrilling 2-2 draw at Liverpool was followed by knocking Arsenal out of the FA Cup earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after Amad Diallo's late hat-trick papered over the cracks in a 3-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Southampton in midweek, Brighton exposed the glaring holes in the foundations of Amorim's United project.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaoru Mitoma squared for Yankuba Minteh to open the scoring inside five minutes. Bruno Fernandes' penalty levelled for United before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitoma restored Brighton's lead on the hour mark before Andre Onana dropped a cross into the path of Georginio Rutter to rifle in a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Brighton up to ninth and within four points of the top four. United remain 13th but enjoy a 10-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't be comfortable in thinking that this is okay, because it is not," said Fernandes. "I'm not here to lose games and be in the position we are in at the moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off, tributes were paid to one of the club's greats in Law, who passed away on Friday aged 84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only Scot ever to win the Ballon d'Or, Law is the third top scorer in United's history, with 237 goals in 404 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  A piper played Scottish national anthem "Flower of Scotland" as the teams walked out, with United legends Alex Ferguson, Brian Kidd, Paddy Crerand and Alex Stepney on the pitch as a eulogy was read out over the tannoy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham are now winless in six league games after Everton boosted their survival chances with the first victory of David Moyes' second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal-shy Toffees had failed to score in nine of their previous 11 league games but struck three times before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Calvert Lewin's first goal since September opened the scoring before a brilliant individual run and finish from Iliman Ndiaye. Archie Gray's own goal compounded Tottenham's misery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Late goals from Dejan Kulusevski and Richarlison reduced Spurs' deficit, but could not avoid a 12th defeat in 22 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a challenging situation for sure, when you are losing players the amount we are at the moment," said under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, who was without 10 first-team regulars. "It's up to me to get us out of it and I've got to be good enough to do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton pull four points clear of the bottom three and within four points of 15th-placed Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest were also rampant in the first 45 minutes to cut the gap at the top and consolidate their lead in the race for a place in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliot Anderson, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Chris Wood netted before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton salvaged some pride in the second period through Jan Bednarek and Paul Onuachu but they remain on course for an immediate return to the Championship, 10 points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola claimed Manchester City are back to their best after Phil Foden starred in a 6-0 rout of struggling Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden netted either side of Mateo Kovacic's eye-catching goal as City blew Ipswich away with three first-half goals at Portman Road. Jeremy Doku, Erling Haaland and James McAtee scored after the interval to give fourth-placed City their biggest league win this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's side have won three of their last four league games as they begin the long climb back to respectability after a dismal start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are really pleased, we are back in many things that have defined this team in the last decade, the last years," Guardiola said. "Really pleased for the players, they deserved it a lot. We recovered some identities that we lost in this path."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterner tests lie in wait for City, including a vital Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday and looming Premier League clashes with Chelsea and Arsenal. But this was the kind of confident display City used to make look routine during their march to four successive English titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Winning is almost certain to prove beyond them as they trail leaders Liverpool by 12 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola will settle for restoring City's pride this term as he rebuilds a team that suddenly grew old and inconsistent before his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The most important thing is that the players, they saw themselves recognise what we are, so that is the best thing I can say," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland, who has scored 112 goals in just 127 appearances for City, this week committed himself to the club until 2034 when he signed a new nine-and-a-half year deal. (AFP)

<img alt="Romelu Lukaku of SSC Napoli celebrates after a goal during the football match against Atalanta BC in Bergamo, Italy. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788167_1_20250119083319.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Romelu Lukaku fired Napoli six points clear at the top of Serie A with the decisive goal in Saturday's thrilling 3-2 win at title rivals Atalanta, as Juventus beat AC Milan 2-0 to move into the Champions League spots.
 <br>
  <br>
  Belgium striker Lukaku nodded home his eighth Napoli goal from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's perfect cross in the 78th minute to give Antonio Conte's team a statement win in Bergamo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matteo Politano and Scott McTominay also scored for Napoli who have 50 points from 21 matches and have made it clear that they are now the team to beat in this year's title race after scoring three times from their only shots on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say whether it's my most important goal (for Napoli) but the win is important. We showed tonight that we're a top team," said Lukaku to Sky.
  <br>
  <br>
  Napoli are gunning for a second Scudetto in three seasons and await the response from champions and closest challengers Inter Milan, who also have a game in hand, against struggling Empoli on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sixth straight win is the perfect boost Napoli need for another massive clash with Conte's old team Juventus, in Naples, this time next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another test for us, to see where we are," added Lukaku.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, goals in five second-half minutes from Samuel Mbangula and Timothy Weah gave Juventus a deserved win in Turin which pushed Thiago Motta's side up to fourth, a point ahead of Lazio who are at Verona on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unbeaten Juve snapped a run of three straight draws which had taken their tally of league stalemates to 13, with Saturday's win just their eighth in 21 fixtures in Italy's top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitute Weah emulated his father in the 64th minute by netting in a Juventus match with Milan 25 years after Ballon d'Or-winner George Weah did the same - for Milan against Juve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The boys are growing, match after match, and getting to the point that they can put in a performance like the one they did tonight," said Motta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because they all work really hard every day... today's win is the reward." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Temperamental Russian Daniil Medvedev was on Saturday fined US$76,000 over his behaviour at the Australian Open, where he destroyed a net camera, threw his racquet and skipped a post-match press conference.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number five was penalised US$10,000 for a meltdown during his five-set first-round win against Thailand's Kasidit Samrej, when he mangled his racquet and ruined the camera.
  <br>
  <br>
  He faced an even bigger penalty – US$66,000 – over his antics in the next round when he crashed out to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the match he threw his racquet toward the sidelines, skidding across the court until it reached an advertising panel near his bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also argued with the umpire after being called out for repeated foot faults, then skipped his obligatory post-match press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev had reached three of the last four Australian Open finals, including in 2024 when he imploded after leading by two sets, losing to Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kyrie Irving scored 25 points as the Dallas Mavericks brought the high-flying Oklahoma City Thunder down to earth with a 106-98 victory over the Western Conference leaders on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City, riding high after their rout of Eastern Conference pace-setters Cleveland on Thursday, suffered just their seventh defeat of the season in a roller-coaster duel against a fired-up Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irving was at the heart of the Mavs win, rattling in 17 points in a 41-point second quarter that allowed Dallas to open up a 64-43 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder, who were missing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with a wrist injury, came roaring back to draw level in the third quarter before edging into a single-digit lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Mavs, who are still without the injured Luka Doncic, regrouped superbly to close out the win, outscoring the Thunder 29-22 in the fourth quarter to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas improved to 23-19 while Oklahoma City remain top of the West with a 34-7 record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas coach Jason Kidd saluted his team's resilience in securing victory after watching a 20-point lead evaporate in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat in that third quarter," Kidd said. "We said on the bench we needed to stay the course, and stay together and in the fourth quarter we did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel like we have a talented team, and they have a talented team. So I thought tonight was a really good test for our group."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Friday, Jimmy Butler returned for Miami after serving a seven-game in-house suspension but was powerless to prevent the Heat from slumping to a 133-113 loss to the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nikola Jokic bagged his 17th triple-double of the season, finishing with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a comfortable victory for the 2023 NBA champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamal Murray led the Denver scoring with 30 points on a night when seven Nuggets players finished in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, who was suspended by Miami after indicating he wished to leave the club earlier this month, finished with 18 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Boston, Jayson Tatum scored 30 points as the NBA champion Celtics shrugged off their heaviest loss of the season to outclass the Orlando Magic 121-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, dominated 110-97 by lowly Toronto on the road on Wednesday, showed no signs of a hangover to complete a comfortable home victory at the TD Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando took a short-lived lead early in the first quarter but once Tatum, Kristaps Porzingis and Jaylen Brown found their range, the result was never in doubt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum's 30-point haul came from 12-of-21 shooting with four three-pointers, six rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porzingis finished with 23 points and Brown added 20, including a perfect 9-of-9 from the free-throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston improved to 29-12 with the victory to remain in second place in the Eastern Conference behind leaders Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Orlando's scoring was led by Cole Anthony with 23 points while Paolo Banchero continued his return from injury with 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New York meanwhile, Anthony Edwards erupted for 36 points as the Minnesota Timberwolves romped to a 116-99 victory over the Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edwards was on fire from outside the arc, making 8-of-13 three-pointers while Naz Reid also caught the eye with 6-of-6 threes in a 23-point cameo shift off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Milwaukee, the Bucks handed Toronto a reality check following their upset of Boston on Wednesday, with a 130-112 blowout at the Fiserv Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee swept to their third-straight win thanks to 35 points from Giannis Antetokounmpo and 26 points from Damian Lillard. The Bucks improved to 23-17 with the victory and remain in the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  In San Antonio, Santi Aldama scored 29 off the bench as the Memphis Grizzlies overwhelmed Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs 140-112.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spurs star Wembanyama produced another big defensive performance with six blocks and a steal with 12 rebounds. But the Grizzlies' balanced offence proved too strong for the home side, with six players finishing in double figures. (AFP)

    Former Man Utd striker Denis Law dies aged 84

Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788120_1_20250118152734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law has died at the age of 84, his family announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace," said the star's family in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law scored a total of 237 goals in 404 appearances during an 11-year spell at Old Trafford until 1973, which places him third behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton on United's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  He played 55 times for Scotland after making his debut at just 18 in 1958 and he remains his country's joint all-time leading scorer with 30 goals alongside Kenny Dalglish.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his time at United, Law won the first division title in 1965 and 1967.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, a cartilage injury forced him to miss the famous 4-1 thrashing of Benfica in the European Cup final at Wembley – a triumph that made United the first English winners of the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester United said the club was mourning the loss of "the king of the Stretford End" – the stand at Old Trafford where there is a statue of Law.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players," United added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ultimate goalscorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently," his family said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you." (AFP)

    Haaland signs bumper new Man City deal until 2034

<img alt="Erling Haaland has scored 111 goals in 126 games for Manchester City. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788067_1_20250117224045.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland has signed a new 9.5-year deal at Manchester City that will keep him at the Etihad until 2034, the Premier League champions announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old striker's existing contract was due to expire in June 2027 but he has now committed his future to the club for the next decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal is the longest in the Premier League, eclipsing the nine-year contract Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year and Haaland's salary will reportedly be about £500,000 (US$610,000) per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  A post on the club's X account read: "Erling's here to stay! We're thrilled to announce Erling Haaland has extended his contract at City to 2034."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made an instant impact after joining City from Borussia Dortmund in 2022, firing 52 goals in all competitions to help the club win a Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup treble in his first season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored a further 38 goals last season as City won a fourth consecutive league title and his overall tally stands at 111 goals in 126 games for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club," said Haaland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years. They have made this such a special place to be and now I am City no matter what."
  <br>
  <br>
  City's outgoing director of football Txiki Begiristain said: "Everyone at the club is absolutely delighted that Erling has signed his new contract.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fact he is signed for so long demonstrates our commitment to him as a player, and his love of this club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has made an incredible impact already in his time here and his amazing numbers and records speak for themselves."
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's extension is a major boost for City in a season where they have unexpectedly struggled on the pitch, with the club sitting sixth, 12 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also appears to be a huge show of faith from the player at a time when the club is waiting to learn the outcome of a major disciplinary case.
  <br>
  <br>
  City faced an independent commission hearing last year to examine more than 100 charges from the Premier League concerning alleged breaches of its financial rules, charges the club have always strenuously denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new contract renewal comes two months after Guardiola's decision to sign a new two-year deal of his own. (AFP)

    Sabalenka fights on, Osaka quits Aussie Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka was pushed to the limit in setting up an Australian Open showdown with teenager Mirra Andreeva on Friday but Naomi Osaka's run ended with an injury retirement in round three.
 <br>
  <br>
  Women's World No. 1 Sabalenka was made to work hard behind a faltering serve before beating Denmark's Clara Tauson in the third round on Rod Laver Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was broken four straight times at the start of the match but found her groove to win 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 after more than two hours of attritional tennis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just super happy that I was able to just stay in the game and I was able to push myself, honestly, to the limit to get this win," said Sabalenka, who is chasing a rare third Melbourne title in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her win puts her into a clash against highly rated 17-year-old Andreeva, the 14th seed, who beat Poland's 23rd seed Magdalena Frech in three sets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia's Andreeva announced her burgeoning talent by beating Sabalenka in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, two-time Melbourne champion Osaka was on a collision course with American third seed Coco Gauff in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former world number one needed treatment on her stomach from the trainer during the first set against Belinda Bencic and called it quits after losing the opener on a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osaka, who was struggling with an abdominal injury in the build-up to the tournament and retired from the final in Auckland, was in the third round of a Slam for the first time since the birth of her daughter in 2023. (AFP)

    Diallo's 12-minute hat-trick rescues Man Utd

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo scored a sensational 12-minute hat-trick as Manchester United roared back to beat Premier League basement club Southampton 3-1, narrowly avoiding a humiliating fourth straight home defeat.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ivory Coast international – United's standout player this season – levelled in the 82nd minute before putting the hosts ahead in the dying seconds of the 90 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was still not done, capitalising on an error from Taylor Harwood-Bellis to grab a third in stoppage time, giving the scoreline a skewed look.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was cruel luck on a Saints side battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst side in Premier League history, still with just one win to their name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ivan Juric's men had deservedly taken the lead through a Manuel Ugarte own goal towards the end of the first half and had numerous chances to extend their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Diallo was once again the saviour for misfiring United following his winning goal at Manchester City and his late equaliser against Liverpool in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today we showed at the end we were the best team," the winger said. "I am so happy for the win today because this team deserves it. I am ready to play every position where the manager likes to put me."
  <br>
  <br>
  United manager Ruben Amorim praised his forward, underlining his attacking threat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He pushes the other team into the final third – that is really important," he said. "We didn't have a good game, but at this moment – winning is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  United secured a morale-boosting FA Cup win at Arsenal on Sunday, which followed a battling 2-2 draw at league leaders Liverpool. (AFP)

    Medvedev stunned by teen qualifier Tien in Aussie Open

<img alt="Tien (L) speaks with Russia's Daniil Medvedev after his victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787918_1_20250117054531.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Daniil Medvedev was dumped out in the Australian Open second round by 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien in a massive Melbourne shock at close to 3:00 a.m. Melbourne time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his debut Australian Open, the American ranked 121 stunned the world number five 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (8/10), 1-6, 7-6 (10/7) in a nailbiter and faces France's Corentin Moutet in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  The left-handed Californian Tien soaked up the applause at Margaret Court Arena after the biggest win of his young career following four hours and 48 minutes of seesawing action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly it hasn't really set in yet," he said. "I'm just pretty happy to be off the court. I don't think I've played a match that long ever, or even spent that much time on a tennis court straight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I'm just glad to be off," he added. "Obviously really happy, but I don't think it fully hit me yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien had defeated Argentina's Camilo Ugo Carabelli in five sets in the first round for his maiden victory at a Grand Slam at the fourth attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These are my first two five-setters," said the gifted teenager, a known talent in tennis circles. "It is nice to feel that I can play these more physical matches and get through them."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a painful exit for Russia's former world number one Medvedev, who has lost three of the last four finals at Melbourne Park including to Jannik Sinner in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Medvedev needed five sets to beat the 418th-ranked Kasidit Samrej on Tuesday in his first match of the season, smashing his racquet and a net camera in a rage at one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  He started more serenely against Tien but errors crept into his play and Tien shook off any early nerves by clinching the first set in 47 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tien showed his mettle and his pedigree in the eighth game by prevailing in one gruelling 32-shot rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2021 US Open champion Medvedev and Tien went to a second-set tie break, where the Russian was left exasperated by a double foot fault on his way to losing the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third set again went to a tie break, where Medvedev pulled out an ace under excruciating pressure to save match point and then clinched the set at the third time of asking to come back from the brink.
  <br>
  <br>
  Suddenly it was all Medvedev and he raced through the fourth set to tee up a decider. Tien appeared to have run out of steam.
  <br>
  <br>
  But from somewhere he located some extra reserves of energy and the duo exchanged breaks early in the fifth set.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was still time for another twist at 5-5 and 15-all on Tien's serve when a shower came, briefly holding up proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>
  They exchanged breaks of serve to go into a 10-point tie break, where there was again nothing between them until Tien finally sealed the deal on his second match point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World No. 2 Iga Swiatek romped into the third round of the Australian Open on Thursday to set up a high-profile clash with 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Poland's Swiatek was racing past World No. 49 Rebecca Sramkova 6-0, 6-2 at the Rod Laver Arena, Britain's Raducanu was entering uncharted waters at the nearby Kia Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu had reached the second round in Melbourne on three previous occasions but never advanced further.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was forced to battle in a topsy-turvy match against her good friend Amanda Anisimova of the United States, with both players exchanging multiple breaks before the Briton came through 6-3, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Melbourne Park's centre court, Swiatek broke the Slovakian's opening service game and never looked back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova was playing in a Grand Slam second round for the first time and had no answer to the precision and power of the Pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek won 64 percent of points off the Slovakian's first serve in an opening set that lasted 27 minutes, the Pole dropping just 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sramkova finally got on the board in the eighth game of the match, to huge cheers from the a sympathetic crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Swiatek remained in control, closing out a comprehensive victory after exactly one hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt really solid today and it was a really efficient game," said Swiatek. "I'm happy that I kept my focus."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu said she was looking forward to the challenge of playing against Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will be a very good match for me," she said of facing the five-time Grand Slam champion. (AFP)

    Arsenal fightback sinks Spurs; Newcastle into top four

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a stirring fightback to beat Tottenham 2-1 in the north London derby.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Son Heung-min's early opener at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they seized the bragging rights against their bitter rivals thanks to Dominic Solanke's own goal and Leandro Trossard's strike just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's first win in four games in all competitions lifted them within four points of leaders Liverpool, who were held to a 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's game in hand on Arsenal still makes them title favourites, but the Gunners are at least applying some pressure on Arne Slot's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 2-0 by Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg last week and eliminated from the FA Cup third round by 10-man Manchester United on penalties on Sunday, Arsenal were desperate for a response and Tottenham once again proved their ideal opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions have been asked of Arteta's ability to add more silverware to the 2020 FA Cup, which remains the only trophy of a reign that started in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka already sidelined due to hamstring surgery, Gabriel Jesus's potentially season-ending knee injury had added to Arteta's woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal have now won seven and drawn one of their last eight league games against Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's team are now on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted," he said. "When you have opportunities to close the gap, you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was another painful blow for under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou, whose team are just eight points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We let Arsenal dictate the game," Postecoglou said after the match. "Second half was a little better but nowhere near good enough – not acceptable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Postecoglou must find a solution to the inconsistency that saw them beat Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg before needing extra-time to see off fifth tier Tamworth in the FA Cup third round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a win in their last five league games, losing four of those to drop to 13th place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raheem Sterling wasted a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead in the opening moments when his heavy touch allowed Djed Spence to clear after the winger raced through on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking wracked with nerves, Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky was fortunate not to gift a goal to Arsenal on his Premier League debut after taking too long to clear, with Kai Havertz unable to apply the finishing touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alexander Isak fired Newcastle into the Premier League's top four after scoring twice in a 3-0 cruise against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Isak found the net for the eighth league match in a row as the Magpies leapfrogged faltering Chelsea into fourth spot in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international put the home side ahead in the 34th minute when his shot took a huge deflection off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, leaving Jose Sa wrong-footed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak doubled Newcastle's lead shortly before the hour mark, controlling Bruno Guimaraes' pass before firing home for his 15th league goal of the season and Anthony Gordon added a third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, who have now won six straight league games, have recovered strongly from a lengthy poor spell to make a powerful case for a Champions League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking advantage of the faltering form of Manchester City and Chelsea, they are just three points behind third-placed Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, David Moyes' return as Everton manager failed to muster a response from the toothless Toffees in a 1-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ollie Watkins' winner early in the second half lifted Villa up to seventh, just three points off the Premier League's top four.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast, 16th-placed Everton are looking over their shoulders, just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of no wins and just one goal in his last five games in charge cost Sean Dyche his job as Everton boss. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers had to settle for a 1-1 draw against Guangdong in the first leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br>
  The only goal for the SAR, playing away at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangzhou, came in the 38th minute from captain Stefan Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made a run down the left flank and the ball was eventually crossed to Lau Ka-kiu in the penalty area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lee Man forward then passed it to Pereira, who took a shot that deflected off a defender, and found its way to the back of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong side had another chance to score after the break, as Alexander Jojo headed the ball from a corner kick but was denied by the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trying to respond, the home side ramped up their attacks in the second half and it paid off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jojo was penalised for a handball in the box in the 74th minute, and Guangdong substitute Jiang Zhipeng nailed the penalty to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to score any more goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played at Hong Kong Stadium next Wednesday to decide the aggregate winner. RTHK will broadcast that match live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year marked the return of the competition for the first time since 2019, and Guangdong won it in a penalty shootout.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Last year's runner-up Zheng Qinwen was knocked out of the Australian Open in the biggest shock of the tournament so far, while defending champion Aryna Sabalenka had to battle serve jitters to make the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fifth seed Zheng was sent packing 7-6, 6-3 at the John Cain Arena by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany, the second-oldest player in the draw at age 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over on centre court Sabalenka dropped her serve three times and faced 11 break points before overcoming Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-3, 7-5, rattling off the last five games in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She played incredible tennis today and it was a really tough one. I expected this tennis from her, I'm really glad I was able to win this match," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win kept the Belarusian World No. 1 on course for a rare hat-trick of consecutive Australian Open titles, a feat last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis and only matched by four other women in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Olympic champion Zheng's attempt to become only the second Chinese player to win a Grand Slam singles title after Li Na is over, after being out-thought by the powerful Siegemund.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I knew I just had to play more than my best tennis. I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free," said the German. (AFP)

<img alt="Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood celebrates after scoring his side's opening goal against Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787576_1_20250115074123.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two as Manchester City's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win the 2015 to 2016 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could not have asked for more," said Liverpool manager Arne Slot. "Second half was outstanding."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong," he added. "Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had to settle for a second consecutive league draw, allowing Arsenal the chance to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Long balls we won and we could run and in that moment we didn't take the right decisions," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "Maybe that would have been different but at the same time they had chances. Their strikers are really good, Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo are really dangerous."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night. They were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we deserved much more, especially in the first half," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The negative thing is that we changed how we played after conceding. The game was completely in our control and it's something we need to improve," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Maro Itoje was selected on Tuesday as England's captain for the Six Nations rugby tournament, replacing Jamie George.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old lock takes the role for the first time, having previously deputised for George when the hooker has been replaced in the second half of games.
  <br>
  <br>
  George, who has had the armband since the 2023 Rugby World Cup, was demoted to vice-captain alongside Ellis Genge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Itoje, who has 88 caps, was appointed as Saracens captain for this season, also ahead of George.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s a calm, influential leader, renowned for his commitment to upholding high standards and his ability to motivate those around him," England coach Steve Borthwick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “His strong rapport with the squad and coaches, combined with his leadership experience at Saracens, makes him ideally placed to take on this responsibility," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Borthwick has picked a 36-man squad for the Six Nations that includes No 8 Tom Willis, but is missing veteran prop Dan Cole and scrumhalf Ben Spencer. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Jalen Green matched his career-high with 42 points and the Houston Rockets rallied from a 13-point fourth-quarter deficit to defeat the visiting Memphis Grizzlies 120-118 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jake LaRavia supplied the Grizzlies with a 100-87 lead when he stole the ball and sank a layup with 9:55 to play. The Rockets then began their comeback.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were seven lead changes and two ties in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thompson posted 19 points, 13 rebounds, five blocks and two steals while teammate Alperen Sengun logged 17 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Cam Whitmore tallied 16 points and hit four 3-pointers off the bench. Houston made 16 of 31 from behind the arc and shot 50.6 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant paced the Grizzlies with 29 points but committed seven turnovers. Desmond Bane scored 15 of his 25 points in the third quarter for Memphis, which shot 52.9 percent but could not corral Green throughout the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Houston has won all three meetings with Memphis this season, two of them in the past five days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 10 points as the Grizzlies jumped in from 18-11, but the Rockets answered with a 10-0 run that featured 3-pointers from Green and Dillon Brooks and yielded a 21-18 lead. Memphis responded with a 9-0 spurt capped by a Jaren Jackson Jr. 3-pointer that was part of a 12-2 close to the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies made 6 of 14 3-point attempts in the first and turned to their bench whenever the Rockets attempted to rally in the second. LaRavia scored 10 of Memphis' 24 first-half bench points, delivering a timely tip-in and a 3-pointer before a five-point surge from Whitmore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green completed a four-point play that gave Houston a 55-54 lead, but Memphis scored the next six points and took a 60-57 halftime lead. (Reuters)

    Former heavyweight champion Fury retires from boxing

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavyweight Tyson Fury declared he's retiring from boxing in a brief social media post on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former heavyweight champion, 36, claims he's calling it quits for the fourth time. "The Gypsy King" suffered a second consecutive defeat last month to Oleksandr Usyk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hi everybody, I'm going to make this short and sweet. I'd like to announce my retirement from boxing," Fury said in a video shared via Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2024, Usyk handed Fury his first career loss by split decision to spoil a career 34-0-1 record. Usyk won the rematch in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  By claiming a unanimous decision, Usyk retained the WBA, WBO and WBC heavyweight championships in the fight held in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury retired briefly in 2013, 2017 and 2022. Most recently, he defeated Dillian Whyte via sixth round technical knockout in April 2022 and declared it was his final bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he returned to the ring in October 2023 to defeat Derek Chisora in a trilogy fight that was stopped late in the 10th round. (Reuters)

<img alt="Denver Nuggets guard Russell Westbrook motions to Mavericks fans after scoring on a layup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787254_1_20250113102753.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, fired by standout performances from Russell Westbrook and Nikola Jokic, rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Dallas Mavericks 112-101.
 <br>
  <br>
  Westbrook scored 21 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists, reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic scored 19 points with 18 rebounds and nine assists and the Nuggets out-scored the Mavs 33-12 in the fourth quarter to seize the victory in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact the Nuggets put together two impressive comeback runs, erasing a seven-point deficit to take a one-point lead early in the third quarter only for the Mavericks to race away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver took the lead for good on Westbrook's running layup for a 97-96 lead with 5:21 to play. Jokic drove for a basket and Westbrook added another layup and the Nuggets pulled away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klay Thompson scored 25 points to lead the Mavericks, who were again without star guards Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe we lead the league in double-figure comebacks, and that's a catch-22 because I don't like the fact that we've been down that many times double figures," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I love about this group is how resilient they are," he added. "We get down, we stay the course, there is no panic – we stay the course and try to find a way. Didn't like the start, but I loved the finish, and that's all that counts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Jalen Brunson scored 44 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 30 points and 18 rebounds to lead the New York Knicks in a 140-106 rout of the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brunson set a tone with 23 points in the first quarter and shook off a hard fall early in the third, as the Knicks rebounded from a lopsided loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and Damian Lillard added 22 for the Bucks, whose three-game winning streak ended.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers erased a 15-point deficit to bring Cleveland's 12-game NBA winning streak to an emphatic end, beating the league-leading Cavaliers 108-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Nembhard scored 19 points, Pascal Siakam added 18 and Myles Turner had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Pacers, who weathered the half-time departure of star guard Tyrese Haliburton with a tight left hamstring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indiana handed the Cavaliers just their second home defeat of the season, notching their own sixth straight victory by a double-digit margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's nothing to lose," Nembhard said of the Pacers' second-half push. "This is the best team in the league right now. We just had to play hard, play together, put some more physicality in the game on the defensive side and play off that." (AFP)

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) hands the ball off to running back Ty Johnson (26) in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787251_1_20250113101925.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen threw two touchdowns as the Buffalo Bills trounced the Denver Broncos 31-7 to cruise into the next round of the NFL playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The second-seeded Bills underscored their status as the biggest threat to Kansas City's hopes of reaching a fifth Super Bowl in six seasons by producing a dominant performance at their Highmark Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buffalo's wild card game victory sets up a blockbuster AFC divisional round clash next weekend against third seeded Baltimore, pitting Allen against the Ravens' reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great quarterback obviously with what he's able to do," Bills quarterback Allen said of his looming duel with Jackson. "He's one of the most dynamic if not the most dynamic quarterback in the league. He's fun to watch. But I'll be watching their defence this week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen finished with 272 passing yards from 20-of-26 attempts, with two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with 46 rushing yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seventh seeds Denver rocked Buffalo with a touchdown on the first drive of the game, quarterback Bo Nix finding receiver Troy Franklin with a deep pass for a 43-yard touchdown to mute the home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills responded with 10 unanswered points, Tyler Bass slotting a 26-yard field goal and James Cook skipping into the end zone for a five-yard touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver had a chance to tie the game on the stroke of halftime but Wil Lutz's 50-yard field goal attempt bounced back off the posts to leave Buffalo 10-7 ahead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills took a stranglehold on the game in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bass slotted a 27-yard field goal to make it 13-7, and after the Bills defense forced another Denver punt, Ty Johnson snagged a superb catch inches off the ground at the back of the end zone from Allen's pass to make it 19-7. A successful two-point conversion put the Bills 21-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen tossed his second touchdown pass at the start of the fourth quarter, picking out Curtis Samuel for a 55-yard touchdown that took the score to 28-7.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver's offense continued to be stymied by Buffalo's defense, their impotence summed up by a failure to convert a 4th&2 situation on their next possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen and the Bills took that opportunity to extend the lead to 31-7 with Bass's third field goal of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also means that the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, will host the Houston Texans in the divisional round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles advanced in the NFC with a 22-10 win over a disappointing Green Bay Packers in a defensive grind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts returned after missing the past two games following a concussion and he showed no signs of rust with an early 11-yard touchdown pass to Jahan Dotson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packers quarterback Jordan Love had a tough day, throwing an early interception with Darius Slay snaffling up the pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even when Love did manage to get Green Bay within field goal range, with a 13-play drive in the second quarter, Brandon McManus missed the kick from 38-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Love threw another interception at the end of the half and although McManus reduced the deficit with a 26-yard field goal in the third, Green Bay never looked in contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas Goedert put Philadelphia 16-3 up when he collected a pass from Hurts and then burst towards the end-zone, delivering two stiff arms to keep Carrington Valentine at bay as he made the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Josh Jacobs gave the Packers some hope with his one-yard rush after he had shown impressive power and strength on the previous play to break a series of tackles and make 31-yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But that was the last productive moment from the Packers with two Jake Elliott field goals wrapping up the win for the Eagles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hurts threw for 131 yards and two touchdowns while running back Saquon Barkley had 119-yards on 19 carries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter how it looks and there's some things we can work on, improve on, the defence did a hell of a job and we got the win," said Barkley. (AFP)

    Atlético Madrid claim La Liga lead with Osasuna win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Julián Alvarez's strike helped Atlético Madrid move top of La Liga with 1-0 win over Osasuna.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side climbed one point clear of champions Real Madrid and six ahead of third-placed Barcelona at the halfway mark in the Spanish league season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético claimed a 14th consecutive victory across all competitions, a new club record, and have lost just one top-flight game all season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their eighth straight league win and a fifth clean sheet from those matches, with Simeone's side back to their miserly best in defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been doing a great job, we know that it's not over here and there's a long way to go, a lot of games to come," Alvarez said. "We have to continue on this path, to keep working with humility, and good things will come."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético started well against an Osasuna side with several regular starters left on the bench, including their top scorer, striker Ante Budimir.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antoine Griezmann had an early goal ruled out for handball, while his strike-partner Alvarez missed Atlético's best chances of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clearest came when Rodrigo De Paul scooped a pass over the top for the Argentina international, but Alvarez's effort, which bounced awkwardly off his shoulder, was saved by Sergio Herrera.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicente Moreno's visitors, 11th, improved as the first half progressed and managed to keep Atlético largely at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  However early in the second half a clever Rojiblancos corner routine helped them break the deadlock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Griezmann's whipped cross to the back post was nodded back into the danger area by Clement Lenglet and Alvarez was able to slam home from close range for his sixth league goal since joining last summer from Manchester City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a move we've been working on, we've had some days to train, to make these strategies," explained Alvarez. "Luckily today it came off, it's important to score from dead balls, because it can be decisive, above all in hard-fought games like these, which are tricky."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were not at their sharpest but had more than enough to seal another victory and claim top spot, with Osasuna not troubling Jan Oblak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Getafe earned a 2-1 win at Las Palmas to climb three points above the relegation zone. (AFP)

    Barca smash Real Madrid to win Spanish Super Cup

<img alt="Barcelona celebrates after winning the Spanish Super Cup. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787223_1_20250113072122.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona hammered rivals Real Madrid 5-2 in a wild Spanish Super Cup Clasico final in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to win the first trophy of the Hansi Flick era.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé put Madrid ahead but a dominant Barcelona hit five in response before their goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to avenge their 4-0 home defeat by Barcelona in October's La Liga Clasico but instead were left battered and bruised by their arch-rivals in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Mbappé's opener, Lamine Yamal levelled and Robert Lewandowski sent Barcelona ahead from the penalty spot, with Raphinha bagging a brace and Alejandro Balde also on target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo Goes pulled one back for Madrid with a free-kick but they could not capitalise further on their numerical advantage in a humiliating defeat for the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really nice, it had been a season since we won a trophy, it's always special and on top of that in a Clasico against Real Madrid," Barcelona defender Jules Kounde said. "We had a lot of calm and patience, knowing that if we applied the plan we would win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very proud and happy with the team," he added. "Right after the red card, we got together and said we were going to have to suffer, sit back, but we had a big advantage and this can't escape us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team's poor defending was the main reason for the heavy defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We defended badly and that cost us the game – they found their goals quite easily," Ancelotti said. "We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that – we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both coaches opted to maintain the same line-ups they started with in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal issued Madrid an early warning with a curling effort from the right which forced Thibaut Courtois into a fine save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian goalkeeper also produced a strong stop to keep a Raphinha header at bay after the Brazilian evaded Lucas Vázquez with ease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Barcelona's opening salvo it was Real Madrid who took the lead in the fifth minute with Mbappé's brilliant goal on the counter-attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French forward, frustrated numerous times by the offside flag in the league defeat by the Catalans, broke loose on the halfway line after Vinicius won the ball back and, after bursting into the area, clipped past Szczesny.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took a stunning individual goal from 17-year-old Yamal to level the scoreline, with the Spanish winger cutting in from the right before stroking home a low finish inside the near post in a similar style to former Barca great Lionel Messi, to whom he is often compared. (AFP)

 Ten-man Manchester United beat Arsenal 5-3 on penalties after a dramatic 1-1 draw in the FA Cup third round, while Tottenham needed extra time before seeing off non-league Tamworth 3-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Defeated 2-0 by Arsenal in the Premier League in December, FA Cup holders United exacted revenge on their return to the Emirates Stadium to extend their revival after last weekend's impressive draw at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's troubled side took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, who smashed a superb strike into the far corner from the edge of the area in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  United defender Diogo Dalot was sent off for a second booking after fouling Mikel Merino nine minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes grabbed Arsenal's equaliser in the 63rd minute, the Brazilian defender swivelling to hit a low shot that took a hefty deflection off Matthijs de Ligt.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal wasted a golden opportunity to take the lead when Harry Maguire's soft challenge on Kai Havertz was ruled a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The furious United defender and team-mate Manuel Ugarte were involved in a melee with several Arsenal players before Altay Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard's spot-kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz missed a host of chances to win it and the German was culpable again in the shoot-out as his effort was saved by Bayindir, setting up the much-maligned Joshua Zirkzee to stroke home the decisive kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deserved to pass through this round because we all suffered together and showed character," said Amorim, whose side host Leicester in the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A few weeks ago Joshua was in a difficult moment, now he was a game-changer," he added. "Life has these beautiful things."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another painful result for Arsenal after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat against Newcastle in the League Cup semi-final first leg and last weekend's damaging league draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a thousand games like this you lose one," said Gunners boss Mikel Arteta, who hasn't won a trophy since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's unbelievable," he added. "We deserved to win the game by a mile. But the reality is we are out and the only thing that's going to be judged is that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham, who are currently 12th in the Premier League, are 96 places above Tamworth – who sit 16th in the fifth-tier National League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supposed gap in quality was rarely apparent as Tottenham's dismal display took them to the brink of a historic humiliation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A part-time team whose players work day jobs alongside their football careers, Tamworth matched their highly-paid and supposedly superior opponents for long periods on the Lamb Ground's sloping artificial pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  They should have caused one of the FA Cup's greatest upsets in normal time but their missed chances proved crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Tshikuna's extra-time own goal and late strikes from Dejan Kulusevski and Brennan Johnson sent Tottenham into the fourth round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a major trophy in 2008, but the under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou boasts he always wins silverware in his second season at a club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having beaten Liverpool 1-0 in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Wednesday, Tottenham remain in contention for a domestic cup double despite a troubled season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They made it hard for us, with the surface it was about us staying calm and being persistent. In the end, we got the job done," said Postecoglou, whose team travel to Aston Villa in the fourth round. (AFP)

    Zheng Qinwen through at rain-hit Melbourne Park

<img alt="China's Zheng Qinwen (left) is congratulated by Romania's Anca Todoni after her victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787174_1_20250112151256.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers cancelled five singles matches as persistent rain washed out a large chunk of play on the opening day of the Australian Open on Sunday, disappointing the large crowds who had flocked to Melbourne Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, teenager Mirra Andreeva, Donna Vekic and Arthur Fils all reached the second round after matches played on the three showcourts which have roofs, but less than an hour's play was possible outside by early evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five of the 32 scheduled singles matches were scratched and organisers will be giving thanks for the cushion of the extra day which was first added to the tournament last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mood and weather had been far brighter at the start of the day as fans formed lengthy queues at the gates eager for the start of the biggest sporting event of the Australian summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of matches on the first few days of the tournament mean that tennis enthusiasts can watch main draw singles action on the outer courts for the relatively cheap price of a ground pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were sent scurrying for cover inside the first hour of play, however, when a violent storm swept across the precinct accompanied by flashes of lightning and explosive cracks of thunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lovely time here, beautiful sitting in the arena, nice watching the water collect, but we didn't get any tennis," said local academic Alex with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've paid 60 bucks and haven't seen anything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The roofs of the showcourts had already been closed and Chinese number one Zheng and Romanian qualifier Anca Todoni continued their baseline battle on Rod Laver Arena despite the wet weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng, who is looking to emulate her idol Li Na's Australian Open triumph of 2014, was always going to attract a lot of support given the number of her compatriots who travel to Melbourne each year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old's last competitive match on the main showcourt was her loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the 2024 final, and the tall Todoni ensured her return was not as comfortable as she might have hoped.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fifth seed, who did not play a warm-up tournament, finally broke for 4-3 in the opening set but Todoni toughed it out, battling through four deuces to hold serve before breaking back for 5-5 and earning a set point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng saved the set point then took the tiebreaker 7-3 and quickly raced to a 3-0 lead in the second set while Todoni, who had treatment on her back, racked up unforced errors as she fought in vain to stay in the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first match is never easy and I made some stupid mistakes," Zheng said after wrapping up her 7-6(3) 6-1 win in a shade under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more pressure (on me but) I think deal good with the pressure and, as Billie Jean King said, pressure is the privilege. Let's keep going playing with pressure."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva was earlier the first player to reach the second round at the 113th edition of the championships when the 17-year-old Russian beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 6-3 6-3 on John Cain Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Margaret Court Arena, the other court with a roof, Fils was the first player to make it into the men's second round when he came from a set down to beat unseeded Finn Otto Virtanen 3-6 7-6(4) 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty nice, man. First time in my life I'm playing on a good court," the 20th seed said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be able to play a match and to finish a match with a roof, it's much more easy than to play, to stop with the rain."
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian 18th seed Donna Vekic, who won Olympic silver behind Zheng in Paris last year, followed Fils onto Margaret Court Arena and beat France's Diane Parry 6-4 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Women's favourite Sabalenka begins her quest for a third straight title against 2017 U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens in the opening match of the evening session on Rod Laver Arena. (Reuters)

    City crush Salford; Chelsea swat aside Morecambe

<img alt="Manchester City's James McAtee (right) celebrates after the match with Rico Lewis. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787147_1_20250112102441.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City dashed the dreams of Salford's former Manchester United star owners with an 8-0 FA Cup rout on Saturday, while Liverpool cruised into the fourth round with a 4-0 victory over Accrington Stanley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea were among the other big winners with a 5-0 demolition of Morecambe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford were the only Premier League side to fall to lower-league opposition as Plymouth, who sit bottom of the Championship, stunned the Bees 1-0 thanks to Morgan Whittaker's late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  League Two Salford have risen through the non-league ranks since investment from David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt began in 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scholes, Butt and director of football Giggs were in attendance at the Etihad but were denied a night to rival their best during glorious playing careers at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola made wholesale changes as Erling Haaland was afforded a rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku opened the scoring after just eight minutes before youngsters Divin Mubama and Nico O'Reilly made it 3-0 before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish scored his first City goal for over a year from the penalty spot, while Doku also netted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  But James McAtee, who had only scored once for City previously, earned man-of-the-match honours with a 20-minute second-half hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been here since I was 10 and it's a special moment for me. Something I'll remember forever," said McAtee.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was never any hint of an upset at Anfield either despite Arne Slot making eight changes for Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold was named captain in the absence of Virgil van Dijk and led by example after being criticised for his display in a 2-2 draw against Manchester United last weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had warned the Premier League leaders that a trip to Anfield would be Accrington's "Champions League final".
  <br>
  <br>
  A mammoth 86 league positions behind Liverpool in the 92-team English league system, Stanley held out for nearly half an hour before Diogo Jota was left with a simple task to tap in from Darwin Nunez's low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander-Arnold then stepped forward to double the lead with a sumptuous hit into the top corner from outside the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could talk for hours about that (goal), unbelievable," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest compliment Trent could get was the reaction of everyone after the Manchester United game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player around the world, maybe except for a few, has a bad game and that is completely normal, but the moment Trent has one, everyone has an opinion about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayden Danns made it 3-0 before Federico Chiesa netted his first Liverpool goal after an injury-hit start to his time in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joao Felix was the star of the show for Chelsea as he got a rare chance to deputise for Cole Palmer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese international and Tosin Adarabioyo both scored twice, while Christopher Nkunku made up for missing an early penalty by netting his 13th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only Liverpool have taken more points at home than Brentford in the Premier League this season, while Plymouth had not won away from home all campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet against the odds Argyle, who sacked former England captain Wayne Rooney 12 days ago, held out and hit Thomas Frank's men with a sucker punch when Whittaker blasted in from outside the area nine minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have pride in everybody, and I'm pleased for the supporters. It's a big day for us," said caretaker Plymouth boss Kevin Nancekivell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The FA Cup brings that romance and we've put a little bit of history in it today by getting the win."
  <br>
  <br>
  High-flying Nottingham Forest continued their excellent season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Luton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton were 4-0 winners at Norwich as Georginio Rutter struck twice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth shrugged off the loss of strikers Evanilson and Enes Unal to long-term injuries this week to roar back from 1-0 down to hammer West Brom 5-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester went one better by hitting QPR for six in an eight-goal thriller at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' bright start under new boss Vitor Pereira continued as early goals from Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rodrigo Gomes secured a 2-1 win at Bristol City. (AFP)

    'It's great to be back': Moyes returns as Everton boss

<img alt="David Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787106_1_20250111175717.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 David Moyes has returned as Everton manager following Sean Dyche's sacking, the struggling Premier League club announced on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "David is widely recognised as one of the Premier League's most experienced and accomplished managers, having led Everton for more than 500 matches from 2002 to 2013," a statement on the club's website read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that David is joining us at this pivotal time in Everton's history," Everton's executive chairman Marc Watts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With over a decade of experience at the club, he is the right leader to propel us through our final season at Goodison Park and into our new stadium. We look forward to working with David to build the foundation of a new era for Everton," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to be back! I enjoyed 11 wonderful and successful years at Everton and didn't hesitate when I was offered the opportunity to rejoin this great club," Moyes remarked.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club's new owners, the Friedkin Group, moved for Moyes after dismissing Dyche just hours before Thursday's 2-0 win against Peterborough in the FA Cup third-round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes is reported to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year contract to return to Everton 12 years after leaving for an unsuccessful spell in charge of Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 61-year-old Scot has been out of work since leaving West Ham at the end of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to start his second spell as Everton boss against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes remains popular with Everton fans after his 11-year stint in charge from 2002 to 2013, a period that included a fourth-place finish in 2005 and an FA Cup final appearance in 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche's two-year reign came to an abrupt end on Thursday after Everton's defeat at Bournemouth on January 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Chelsea boss Graham Potter was said to be Everton's top target but he joined West Ham, with Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Fenerbahce in Turkey, also reportedly distancing himself from the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moyes will be tasked with leading Everton away from the relegation zone as they prepare to usher in a new era at their Bramley Moore Dock Stadium from next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche managed only one win in his last 11 games in charge, leaving them just one point above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Everton defender Leighton Baines, now the club's under-18s head coach, and captain Seamus Coleman took charge for the win against third tier Peterborough. (AFP)

    Monfils, 38, becomes oldest ATP Tour champion

<img alt="Gael Monfils of France hits a return to Zizou Berges of Belgium during their singles final match at the ATP Auckland Classic, in Auckland. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787094_1_20250111153952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gael Monfils became the oldest singles champion in ATP Tour history when the 38-year-old Frenchman swept to victory in the final of the Auckland Classic on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Monfils outclassed Belgian qualifier Zizou Bergs 6-3, 6-4, to eclipse Swiss great Roger Federer in the record books, a day before the start of the Australian Open in Melbourne.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils powered to a 13th career title and became the oldest player to win an ATP final since the Tour launched in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federer was two months younger when he won the Swiss Indoors in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flamboyant Monfils roared and flexed to the crowd after clinching victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was proud to win at an age when others have usually hung up the racquet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Age is a number but I keep working," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I keep believing that I can play high quality tennis and I've been showing it this week so I'm very happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils won his first ATP Tour title in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was 20 years ago, I still have the passion to play tennis, I still feel like I strike a very good ball so hopefully many more to come."
  <br>
  <br>
  In hot conditions, the Frenchman defied his age to play with greater athleticism than Bergs, who was contesting his first final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bergs dropped his serve early in both sets and lacked the firepower to break back against Monfils's clinical serve and varied groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monfils will rise 11 places to 41st in the world after his victory, taking the momentum into Melbourne, where he faces fellow Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the first round of the Australian Open. (AFP)

    Lakers coach hopes team return can 'give people hope'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Lakers coach J.J. Redick says he hopes the team's eventual return to play can "give people hope" after seeing his Pacific Palisades home incinerated in the deadly wildfires that have ravaged the city.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers postponed a scheduled home game against Charlotte on Thursday because of the fires, which have left at least 11 people dead and destroyed around 10,000 homes and other buildings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick oversaw practice on Friday for what was expected to be an emotionally charged home game against the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday, but that game too was postponed in a decision announced by NBA league chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers' game against Charlotte set for Saturday was also postponed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick is one of several members of the Lakers organization directly impacted by the fires, seeing his family's rented property in Pacific Palisades, the ground zero of the disaster, consumed by the flames.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Redick became emotional as he spoke to reporters about the personal impact of the disaster on his family.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years," said Redick, who was living in the house with his wife, Chelsea, and their two sons.

  <br>
  "It was not prepared for what I saw," Redick said of visiting Pacific Palisades after returning home from the Lakers' road game at Dallas in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  By that stage, Redick's family had been evacuated to a hotel. The Lakers coach then paid a visit to his home early on Wednesday to assess the situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was complete devastation and destruction. I went a different way to the house through the village, and it's all gone," Redick said. "I don't think you can ever prepare yourself for something like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Redick said his family had lost "irreplaceable" items in the destruction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everything that we owned that was of any importance to us in almost 20 years together as a couple and 10 years of parenting was in that house." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Graham Potter suffered a painful start to his West Ham reign as Aston Villa's late surge sealed a 2-1 win in the FA Cup third round on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Potter was hired by the Hammers on Thursday to replace Julen Lopetegui, who was sacked earlier this week after just six months in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the former Chelsea manager was unable to make a winning return to the dug-out as West Ham squandered the first half lead given to them by Lucas Paqueta.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a freezing evening at Villa Park, Unai Emery's men emphasised the size of the task facing Potter with a second half fightback that exposed West Ham's defensive flaws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amadou Onana equalised before Morgan Rogers bagged the winner to leave Potter holding his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Brighton boss is back in management for the first time since being dismissed by Chelsea in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter lasted less than seven months at Chelsea, losing 11 times in his 31 games in charge and slumping to 11th place in the top-flight despite a 288 million pound spending spree in his one transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter has tried to learn from the "pain" of that failure, vowing to "come back stronger" after an experience that may have cost him a chance at the England job when Thomas Tuchel was hired last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter had just one training session with his players before the trip to Villa and was without key forwards Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the circumstances, he can be encouraged by West Ham's attacking play but fixing their issues at the back must be top of his to-do list.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overall, disappointed to go out, but lots of positives in the game," Potter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The start was really good but in the second half Aston Villa stepped-up and pushed us back a bit too much. That's something we will have to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third tier Wycombe enjoyed a surprise 2-0 win over Championship side Portsmouth in Friday's other third round tie. (AFP)

    'England should play Afghanistan cricket match'

<img alt="Lisa Nandy, the UK Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport says the game should go ahead. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787019_1_20250110211340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England's upcoming Champions Trophy cricket match against Afghanistan should go ahead despite calls for a boycott over the Taliban's treatment of women, according to a senior British government minister.
 <br>
  <br>
  A group of more than 160 British politicians have called on the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to refuse to play Afghanistan in protest at the women's sports policy of the Taliban.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to power in 2021 the Taliban have effectively banned female participation – a move that puts the Afghanistan Cricket Board at odds with International Cricket Council (ICC) rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ICC, however, has allowed the Afghanistan men's team to continue to compete in global competitions, with England due to face them in the one-day international Champions Trophy in Lahore on February 26.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Cabinet minister Lisa Nandy said the match should be played amid concerns a boycott would see England docked points were they to forfeit the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I do think it should go ahead," Nandy, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  She added: "I'm instinctively very cautious about boycotts in sports, partly because I think they're counterproductive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think they deny sports fans the opportunity that they love, and they can also very much penalise the athletes and the sports people who work very, very hard to reach the top of their game, and then they're denied the opportunities to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are not the people that we want to penalise for the appalling actions of the Taliban against women and girls."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ECB has resisted calls for a boycott, with chief executive Richard Gould saying instead he would "actively advocate" for collective action by the ICC instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  That position has been backed by Downing Street, with a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer urging the ICC to take the lead on the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa, who are also due to play Afghanistan at the Champions Trophy, have backed the ECB's stance.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is despite veteran anti-apartheid campaigner and British politician Peter Hain, who played a key role in sparking his native South Africa's sporting isolation during the 1970s, calling for a boycott.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of the view that a more unified and collective approach from all ICC members will be more impactful," said Cricket South Africa president Rihan Richards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mitch Jeter's 41-yard field goal with seven seconds left lifted Notre Dame to a 27-24 comeback win over Penn State in the Orange Bowl -- one of the College Football Playoff semifinals -- on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seventh-seeded Fighting Irish won their 13th game in a row and advanced to the CFP national championship game, which will be played on January 20 in Atlanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their opponent will be the winner of the Friday night Cotton Bowl match-up between fifth-seeded Texas and eighth-seeded Ohio State.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be the first time Notre Dame has played for a national title since 2013 when it lost to Alabama in a game played in Miami Gardens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Gray's diving interception of a pass from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar with 33 seconds left set up the Fighting Irish's winning score.
  <br>
  <br>
  Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard completed 15 of 23 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and converted a key first down on the Fighting Irish's final drive to set up Jeter's game-winner. (Reuters)

    Cavs down Raptors for 12th straight victory

<img alt="Cavs guard Darius Garland drives to the basket against Toronto Raptors guard Jamal Shead. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786925_1_20250110120213.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland erupted for 40 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers came from behind to extend their unbeaten streak to 12 games with a 132-126 defeat of the Toronto Raptors.
 <br>
  <br>
  Twenty-four hours after their bruising win over the Western Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder, the Cavs looked poised to suffer a huge upset after the Raptors opened up a 12-point lead late in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a late burst of scoring from Garland hauled the Cavs back into the contest, and a lopsided 34-23 fourth quarter sealed a battling victory for the Eastern Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland finished with 40 points from 14-of-22 shooting – 14 points coming in a fourth quarter flurry that swung the game decisively to Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson was left in no doubt as to the size of Garland's contribution to a win which leaves Cleveland leading the standings with a 33-4 record, six games clear of the reigning champion Boston Celtics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He carried us," Atkinson said of Garland's performance. "This is the first game all year where I felt like one guy carried us. We weren't good but he single-handedly took over this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atkinson said Garland's performance was further proof of why he should be a shoo-in for next month's All-Star game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I respect the league but he's got to be in that top, All-Star tier," Atkinson added. "He's phenomenal. He completely took over the game and carried us."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donovan Mitchell missing from the Cavaliers line-up, Garland's scoring support came from Evan Mobley with 21 points while Jarrett Allen provided 18 points with 15 rebounds, two blocks and a steal to cap a fine all round display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other NBA games, the injury-hit Mavericks produced a late fourth quarter escape to grab a 117-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers in Dallas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs, missing injured stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, looked headed for defeat after trailing by 10 points with just over four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But an electrifying 16-0 run flipped the script and set up an unlikely Dallas win. P.J. Washington led the scoring with 23 points and Dereck Lively added 21 to close out the victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Orlando, meanwhile, Julius Randle finished with 23 points and Anthony Edwards added 21 as the Minnesota Timberwolves cruised to a 104-89 victory over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Detroit, the Golden State Warriors held off the Pistons to dig out a 107-104 win on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Buddy Hield led the Warriors scorers with 19 points while Stephen Curry finished with 17 after an uncharacteristically wayward shooting performance from long-range. Curry made only five-of-21 shots from the field, including only two of 14 attempted three-pointers. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo struck to earn Real Madrid a 3-0 win over Real Mallorca to set up a Spanish Super Cup final clash with rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  Madrid have the chance to earn revenge for their heavy Clasico defeat in La Liga in October after Bellingham's clinical second-half strike sent them on their way to victory in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Backed heavily by fans in Jeddah Madrid never looked like letting the advantage slip and a stoppage-time own goal by Martin Valjent secured their win, with Rodrygo adding a late third from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid made the early running against last season's Copa del Rey runners-up, with Lucas Vázquez and Rodrygo coming close in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kylian Mbappé appealed for a penalty after going down under pressure from Dani Rodríguez but it would have been soft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jagoba Arrasate's Mallorca found their footing and did well to restrict the Spanish and European champions to no further clear chances in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid lost Aurelien Tchouameni early in the second half after he hurt his head in a challenge with Cyle Larin, although he appeared frustrated to be withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute through Bellingham after the post and Mallorca goalkeeper Dominik Greif kept Rodrygo and Mbappé at bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  A blistering Madrid move bore fruit when Rodrygo's header from Vinicius Junior's cross hit the upright and Mbappé's effort was parried by the scrambling Greif.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham was in the right place at the right time to carefully slot home the rebound past defenders on the goal-line, continuing a stunning run of individual form.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international has eight goals for Madrid in his last 10 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca struggled to find a way back in and ended up contributing Madrid's second goal, when Valjent stretched to cut out a pass but slid the ball into his own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrygo wrapped up the win late on to set up a repeat of last season's final, won by Super Cup holders Madrid. (AFP)

    Struggling Everton sack manager Dyche

<img alt="Dyche at a Premier League football match between Everton and West Ham United. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786879_1_20250110060303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League strugglers Everton sacked manager Sean Dyche just hours before their FA Cup third-round tie against Peterborough.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speculation about Dyche's future had intensified with reports suggesting Everton's new owners, the US-based Friedkin Group, were talking to potential successors since completing a US$492 million takeover last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in a statement Dyche had been "relieved of his duties as senior men's first-team manager with immediate effect" after two years in charge, with the process to appoint a new boss under way.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees are once again battling to avoid relegation from the Premier League after winning just one of their past 11 games, with that sole success coming against fellow drop candidates Wolves in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton Under-18s head coach Leighton Baines and club captain Seamus Coleman will take charge against third-tier Peterborough on an interim basis while the Liverpool side seek a permanent replacement for Dyche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, currently in charge of Turkish club Fenerbahce, has recently been linked with Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho has experience of working with the Friedkin Group at Roma, although the Italian club sacked him just under a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes, who managed Everton between 2002 and 2013, ex-England coach Gareth Southgate, Brentford boss Thomas Frank and Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola are also among the reported contenders to succeed Dyche.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have won only three times in 19 league matches this season and are languishing in 16th place, with only one point separating them from the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked earlier this week if the club were considering his position, Dyche's answer suggested he knew the sack could be looming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be clear, it should be," the former Burnley boss said. "At the end of the day, if you're a business of this size, succession planning should surely be part of their diligence – I've got no problem with that at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the noise has grown very powerful here, but we've had it before," he added. "The players haven't lacked effort, but it's obviously affecting them because you can see it in their performances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dyche took charge at Everton in January 2023 and kept them in the top-flight despite numerous issues, including last season's points deduction for breaching Premier League rules on profit and sustainability.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finished 17th in Dyche's first season, avoiding the drop with a victory against Bournemouth on the last day, and came 15th last term, extending their streak of being ever-present in English football's top-flight since 1954. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham sacked manager Julen Lopetegui after just 22 games in charge, with former Chelsea boss Graham Potter expected to replace him at the London Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers are 14th in the Premier League table, seven points above the relegation zone, after just six wins in 20 league matches during the Spaniard's tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 4-1 hammering at champions Manchester City on Saturday was the final straw for club chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, 58, took training as usual on Tuesday and reported for work on Wednesday to be officially told his spell in charge was over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "West Ham United can confirm that head coach Julen Lopetegui has left the club," the Hammers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first half of the 2024 to 2025 season has not aligned with the club's ambitions and the club has therefore taken action in line with its objectives," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were among the biggest spenders in the Premier League in the summer transfer window, splashing out around US$155 million on players including Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Fullkrug.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lopetegui won just one of his first six league games and oversaw several heavy defeats, including a 5-2 loss to Arsenal and a 5-0 drubbing by Liverpool, both at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Real Madrid and Spain boss was appointed in May last year to replace David Moyes, who left at the end of last season after a second spell at the London club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Scot, West Ham qualified for European competition for three consecutive seasons, winning the Europa Conference League in 2023 to secure the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, who had previously managed Wolves in the Premier League, said at the time of his appointment he had other opportunities but he was "very happy that West Ham chose me because I chose West Ham too".
  <br>
  <br>
  In their search for a replacement for Lopetegui, the club reportedly spoke to former AC Milan boss Paulo Fonseca and ex-Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Potter is the hot favourite to replace Lopetegui, with the club understood to have held talks with the former Chelsea and Brighton manager about becoming their new manager, initially on a short-term deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter, 49, has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea in April 2023, just seven months into a five-year contract. He won a mere 12 of his 31 matches in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Englishman began his managerial career at Swedish club Ostersund and had successful spells with Swansea and Brighton before taking over at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>

  West Ham face Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round prior to Premier League matches against Fulham and Crystal Palace. (AFP)

<img alt="Lucas Bergvall celebrates after scoring his first goal for Tottenham. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786721_1_20250109070658.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lucas Bergvall condemned Liverpool to only their second defeat this season as the teenager's late strike earned Tottenham a controversial 1-0 win in the League Cup semi-final first leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bergvall struck with just four minutes left in north London, but Liverpool boss Arne Slot was furious that the Swede was still on the pitch to score his first goal for Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already on a yellow card, the 18-year-old had escaped a second booking moments earlier after tripping Kostas Tsimikas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsimikas was out of position after the tackle when Bergvall scored from an attack that started on the left flank vacated by the Liverpool defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's victory was a welcome tonic for Rodrigo Bentancur, who was taken to hospital after suffering a worrying injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur stooped to head a corner in the seventh minute and stayed on the ground after falling unchallenged. His team-mates showed immediate concern and play was stopped as Bentancur received medical attention for nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old was given oxygen through a mask during the treatment as a hush fell on the capacity crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  At half-time, Tottenham moved to ease fears over Uruguay star Bentancur, who only recently returned from a seven-game ban for using a racial slur about teammate Son Heung-min.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm Rodrigo is conscious, talking and will go to hospital for further checks," the club said in a statement on X during the half-time interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of Tottenham's spluttering form and his attacking tactics, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou claimed earlier this term that he always wins a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The under-fire Australian could do with backing up that boast given Tottenham's poor form in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a trophy when they lifted the League Cup in 2008 and the competition is shaping up as an opportunity to end that long silverware drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool won the League Cup last season in what proved to be Jurgen Klopp's last trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has taken Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and the Champions League since replacing Klopp, making this a rare flop from the Reds under the Dutchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result was Liverpool's first defeat in 24 games in all competitions since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in the league in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the only other loss endured by Slot this season and, following Sunday's disappointing 2-2 draw with lowly Manchester United, he is facing the first test of his prolonged honeymoon period on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second leg at Anfield on February 6 will decide who advances to the final. (AFP)

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

<img alt="Mavericks guard Quentin Grimes (5) celebrates with teammate Maxi Kleber. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786610_1_20250108122043.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quentin Grimes was the unlikely hero for Dallas as the injury-hit Mavericks out-classed LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 118-97 to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grimes came off the bench to score 23 points and grab nine rebounds, drilling six of the Mavericks' 18 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, last season's Western Conference champions, had gone 1-5 since losing Luka Doncic to a calf strain on Christmas Day. Still without the Slovenian star, they announced on Monday that Kyrie Irving would be sidelined for some time with a lower back sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by as many as six in the second quarter, the Mavs closed the first half on an 11-0 scoring run to take a 55-50 lead and never trailed in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 21 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Lakers and James added 18 points, 10 boards and eight assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Dallas out-rebounded the Lakers 44-33 and with 11 offensive rebounds managed 15 second-chance points to the Lakers' seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  P.J. Washington scored 22 points, Spencer Dinwiddie added 19 and Klay Thompson chipped in 13 for Dallas – who bumped the Lakers from fifth place in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew we had to get back on track," Grimes told broadcaster TNT. "Came out with the right mindset after dropping five in a row, so good to get back on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach JJ Redick said his team's inability to defend the perimeter was key.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the energy, It felt like we played a little tired tonight," he said. "When you're on the road and the other team is banging threes, it can be a little deflating to the overall energy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Anthony Edwards scored 32 points with nine rebounds to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-97 victory over the Pelicans, spoiling Pels star Zion Williamson's return from a two-month injury absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson scored 22 points with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Dejounte Murray led New Orleans with 29 points, but CJ McCollum had a rough night – scoring just five points on one-for-14 shooting. (AFP)

    Newcastle beat Arsenal in League Cup semis first leg

<img alt="Alexander Isak opened the scoring for Newcastle during their English League Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786563_1_20250108071526.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle took a giant stride towards the League Cup final as goals from Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon earned a 2-0 semi-final, first leg lead at Arsenal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies have never previously won the competition and have had to wait since 1969 to celebrate any major trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Isak they have the form striker in England right now and he rifled home the opener then helped tee up the second for Gordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have a mountain to climb when the sides meet for the second leg on February 5 if they are to progress to meet either Tottenham or Liverpool in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of silverware to both clubs was reflected in the line-ups, as Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe named their strongest available teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has brought Arsenal back into contention for Premier League titles in recent seasons, but his only trophy in charge of the Gunners came five years ago by lifting the FA Cup in the early months of his reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were able to welcome back Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli from the side that started the 1-1 draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's lack of a lethal striker like Isak proved the difference between the sides. Arsenal had the majority of the ball and the chances but failed to make them count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinelli came closest when he raced onto Leandro Trossard's pass and smashed against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later came the sucker punch. Arsenal, so renowned for their own set-piece threat, allowed a long free-kick into their box to fall at the feet of Isak who fired in off the underside of the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede's 14th goal in his last 15 games took him to 50 in a Newcastle shirt – doing so in five fewer matches than it took the club's record goalscorer Alan Shearer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak had a major role to play in what could be a decisive second goal in the tie just after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Newcastle striker's quick feet allowed him to get a shot off that was parried by David Raya into the path of the onrushing Gordon to fire in the rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal should still have made their mammoth task for the return leg in Tyneside next month a more manageable one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz somehow miscued a header wide with the goal gaping to cut the arrears. Howe replaced Isak and Gordon as Newcastle were happy to just to protect their lead in a 5-5-0 formation for the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, though, lacked the guile to break them down without the injured Bukayo Saka to seemingly extend their wait for Arteta's revolution to deliver another trophy. (AFP)

 Didier Deschamps, France's longest serving national team coach, will reportedly not seek to renew his contract which expires in 2026, according to the French Football Federation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deschamps' deal runs until after the next World Cup, for which Les Bleus have yet to qualify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old took over from fellow 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc in 2012 and led Les Bleus to the World Cup title in 2018, two years after reaching the European Championship final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former France captain, one of only three to win football's most prestigious prize as a player and a coach, guided the national team to the World Cup final again in 2022 – losing to Argentina on penalties after one of the best matches in the tournament's history. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham have exercised the option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until June 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Son's deal, which he signed in 2021, was due to expire at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean, 32, joined the Premier League club in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen and has made 431 appearances, scoring 169 goals – fourth on Tottenham's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son was named club captain in August 2023, and shared the Premier League's Golden Boot with Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah in the 2021 to 2022 season after scoring 23 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also captain of South Korea, making 131 appearances to date and scoring 51 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the current season, he has scored seven goals in all competitions in a struggling Spurs side who are 12th in the Premier League table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham said the South Korea international had become a “global star” and a “modern-day great” in his time at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement of his extension came ahead of Tottenham's English League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool. (AFP/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 This year's Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition will highlight a roster of young players from the SAR, as Hong Kong, China aim to nurture a new generation of talent for international play.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of the tournament will take place at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangdong on January 15, while the SAR will host the return leg at Hong Kong Stadium on January 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darren Arnott, head coach of the youth divisions, will be leading the Hong Kong, China team of 37 players, with 29 of them under the age of 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), said on Tuesday that the experience will be crucial in encouraging young players to take on a key role in football development in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the main initiatives of the HKFA is to develop more young players and give them more opportunities to play and train. So under this strategy, we have a number of initiatives," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that at the last Asian Games at Hangzhou, it was mainly comprised of the youth team U-23. We had a historic result in the Asian Games, which showed that Hong Kong has a bright future and we have many good quality youth players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said the association has established a league for younger players and set up a training base in Guangxi to provide players with better facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong Stadium will host the second leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK will broadcast both matches live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that the HKFA is in discussions with Kai Tak Sports Park about the possibility of hosting the home games for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, starting with the match against India in June.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015-2016 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths," he added. "It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better. It is well and truly too early to talk about a title challenge, we are not thinking about that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels, but the chances dried up for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed-up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Rugby Sevens in March will be held at the Kai Tak Stadium for the first time. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786277_1_20250106110908.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong China Rugby on Monday said the first Rugby Sevens tournament to be held at the new stadium in Kai Tak will be a next-level event.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, Hong Kong China Rugby CEO, made the comments after authorities said the first test event at the main stadium of the Kai Tak Sports Park went well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon said his operations team is now busy with debriefing and reviewing with stakeholders ahead of the Rugby Sevens, which will be held at the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Sevens is famous around the world, of course, as the event that every Sevens player wants to play in. And I think the first tournament in the new stadium is going to take that to an even higher level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said athletes and fans are excited about the new state-of-the-art venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players will be able to enjoy [the experience] in the much better surroundings of Kai Tak which is also more conducive to enhancing their performance slightly on the pitch, so that'll be great for the players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon noted that the stadium in Kai Tak was at 20 percent capacity during Sunday's test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the atmosphere we had, I think the fans are in for something really incredible" during the Rugby Sevens, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that the new South Stand will be bigger and would overlook the Hong Kong skyline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Probably the most unique feature in the stadium is the window looking out on the Hong Kong skyline on the South Stand terrace, and that's going to make the experience even more memorable for fans."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dominant United States lifted their second United Cup mixed team tournament title in three years after they beat Poland 2-0, with Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz both winning their singles matches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seeds in the US$10 million tournament that began with 18 nations in contention clinched the trophy when Fritz defeated Hubert Hurkacz 6-4 5-7 7-6(4), after Coco Gauff outclassed Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans had also won the 2023 title in the inaugural edition of the tournament, which serves as a tune-up event for the Australian Open Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the second singles contest locked at one set apiece, Fritz raised his level at 3-3 in the tiebreak of the decider to see off Hurkacz and spark huge celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff earlier stepped up preparations for the year's first major that begins next Sunday with a second successive win over world number two Swiatek in a blockbuster showdown that gave fans at the Ken Rosewall Arena their money's worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number three, who beat Swiatek en route to the WTA Finals title last season, squandered a 2-0 lead in the first set but battled back from there to gain the upper hand in the match as her opponent counted the costs of 19 unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-octane set that followed, Gauff recovered a break to level at 4-4 and went on to secure the win that ensured she ended her singles campaign at the tournament unbeaten. (Reuters)

    Dembélé powers PSG to 3rd straight French Super Cup

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ousmane Dembélé scored a stoppage-time winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Monaco 1-0 to win the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The France winger was unmarked at the back post to meet a low cross from the left by Fabián Ruiz in the second minute of added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG won the trophy, also known as the French Super Cup, for a record-extending 13th overall. PSG won the league and cup double last season, with Monaco finishing second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The result reflects our domination,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said, while Monaco coach Adi Hütter conceded PSG played better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A goal in the last minute always feels like a knife in the back,” Hütter said. “PSG deserved to win if we're being honest, they had more chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match took place at Stadium 974 in Doha, Qatar, with PSG owned by Qatar-based QSI since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Désiré Doué hit the crossbar early on for PSG and Monaco goalkeeper Philipp Köhn made several saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monaco improved after the break and hit the post through Eliesse Ben Seghir and Brazilian defender Vanderson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Köhn made a fine save to deny Achraf Hakimi in the 74th minute, he failed to properly read Ruiz's cross and Monaco missed out on winning the trophy for the first time since 2000. (AP)
