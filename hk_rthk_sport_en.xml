<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are through to the Champions League semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Despite losing 3-1 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday with Serhou Guirassy hitting a hat-trick, the Spanish giants won through 5-3 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holding a 4-0 lead after a dominant performance in Catalonia, the visitors were made to sweat as Dortmund and Guirassy nearly pulled off a stunning turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guirassy put Dortmund in front with a Panenka from the spot with 11 minutes gone and headed them two goals clear early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dortmund sensed a sensation but Barcelona hit back, Fermin Lopez forcing Ramy Bensebaini into an own goal with just over half an hour remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guirassy re-ignited Dortmund's belief with a third on the 76th-minute mark and the final stages may have been different had Julian Brandt not been offside before scoring with 11 minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona coach Hansi Flick praised Dortmund's performance and said his side "need to focus on the positive, not the negatives".
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the team has shown in the past few weeks is incredible. We've got a lot ahead of us this season. We're a step further but we're not even close to the end," added the German.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, considered title favourites, will face either Inter Milan or Bayern Munich in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Birmingham, PSG survived a second-half onslaught to beat Aston Villa 5-4 on aggregate and reach the Champions League semi-finals, despite a 3-2 defeat on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French champions were cruising towards the last four when full-backs Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes struck in the first 27 minutes to add to their 3-1 first-leg lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Youri Tielemans pulled a goal back for the English side before half-time, and two goals in two minutes from John McGinn and Ezri Konsa transformed the tie early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG were thankful to goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma for keeping Unai Emery's men at bay and preventing another famous collapse in the Champions League knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end, we got them suffering like we did," said Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To get this level is the next step forward that I want to try to build with Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa boss Emery was in charge of PSG when Luis Enrique's Barcelona overturned a 4-0 first leg deficit with a dramatic 6-1 win in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique again emerged victorious over his compatriot but this time was the one who watched his team almost blow a seemingly unassailable lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have to say that match for us is something that allows us to grow up and try to compete even better," said the PSG coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole two matches we deserved to win and we are very happy because it's the second year in a row in the semi-finals."
  <br>
  <br>
  Through to their second consecutive semi-final in the competition, PSG will face the winner of the last-eight tie between Arsenal and Real Madrid. (AFP)

<img alt="LA28 confirmed venues for surfing, triathlon, baseball, cricket and squash among other sports. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800552_1_20250416074358.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An iconic Hollywood studio lot and the golden sands of Venice Beach are among an array of Los Angeles landmarks that will stage events for the 2028 Olympic Games, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an updated list of venues for the Games, LA28 confirmed on Tuesday venues for surfing, triathlon, baseball, cricket and squash among other sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Universal Studios will play host to squash's Olympic debut, with the sport taking place on Courthouse Square – the mock-up town square featured prominently in Oscar-winning movies such as "Back to the Future" and "To Kill a Mockingbird".
  <br>
  <br>
  Venice Beach meanwhile will host the triathlon – relocating from its initial venue in Long Beach – and will also be the starting point for the men's and women's marathon, as well as the cycling road races.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also confirmed that cricket – which is making its return to the Olympics for the first time in more than a century – will be held at a purpose-built venue at Pomona, just east of Los Angeles. Earlier reports had suggested cricket could have been staged thousands of miles from Los Angeles in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue for surfing was also confirmed, with the competition taking place at Trestles Beach in the coastal town of San Clemente, roughly 98 kilometres from Los Angeles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trestles is widely considered to be one of the best surfing locations in California, known for consistent waves and a classic point break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baseball will take place at Dodger Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Dodgers, which also hosted the sport at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've promised the world an incredible Olympic Games and today we're proud to share the plan that will make it happen," LA28 chief executive Reynold Hoover said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2028 Olympic venue plan invites communities from across the region to celebrate the Games coming to their backyard with the most exciting sports staged at some of the world's top-tier existing stadiums and arenas, famous beaches and purpose-built temporary structures."
  <br>
  <br>
  Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass said the venue plan announced on Tuesday would "bring the Games to all corners of our city like never before".
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the Sepulveda Basin to the iconic shores of Venice Beach, our world-famous neighbourhoods as well as our hidden gems will be on full display for all to experience and enjoy," Bass said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other event venues announced include horse racing's Santa Anita Park, which will host the equestrian events and Anaheim's Honda Center, which will host volleyball. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's junior men’s epee team made history at the World Cadets and Juniors Fencing Championships in Wuxi, clinching their first-ever bronze medal in the event - a landmark achievement for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  The quartet of Gao Ying-chuen, Kenton Hsu, Wong Chi-ho, and Yuen Nok-man stormed through the early rounds, overcoming the Netherlands, Germany and Ukraine in succession to secure a spot in the semifinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although they were stopped by Canada in their quest for gold, the team regrouped for a dramatic bronze-medal showdown against Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a tense finale, Hong Kong narrowly edged out their rivals 45-43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trailing 23-25 at halftime, Yuen turned the tide with a gritty 3-1 rally in the sixth round to level the score at 26-26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong then ignited a commanding 9-3 surge, propelling Hong Kong to a 35-29 lead and cementing their path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy claimed gold in the event, with Canada securing silver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men’s team bronze, combined with Wu Haidi’s earlier third-place finish in the women’s cadet individual epee, capped Hong Kong’s campaign with two medals - a record haul for the SAR at the championships.

<img alt="Eddie Howe, who is recovering from pneumonia, may miss several key matches. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800524_1_20250415235243.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle manager Eddie Howe will only return to lead the club when he is "100 percent" ready following a diagnosis of pneumonia, his assistant Jason Tindall said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The League Cup winners, who are chasing a Champions League spot, issued a statement on Monday saying the 47-year-old, who was admitted to hospital on Friday, was recovering and would miss Premier League games against Crystal Palace and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe, who sent his congratulations to the team after Sunday's impressive 4-1 win over Manchester United moved them back into the top four, offered thanks for the messages of support he has received in the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tindall, speaking to reporters on the eve of Newcastle's home match against Palace, said: "We've had minimal dialogue together since that announcement. He's in the best possible hands and he'll be back as soon as he feels he's ready to come back 100 percent to lead the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  No timeframe has been established for Howe's return and, with the Magpies sitting a point behind third-placed Nottingham Forest, Tindall could find himself at the helm for the defining period of the Premier League season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked what role Howe might play, he said: "For the manager not to be here, he's obviously poorly in hospital and the same as last week, we had minimal contact in terms of preparations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we know the expectations and demands that we put on each other and ourselves each and every day, and it's going to have to remain that way until the manager is back."
  <br>
  <br>
  In-form Newcastle, who have seven league games to play, will move above Forest into third place if they avoid defeat against Palace at St James' Park on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top five teams in the Premier League will all qualify for the Champions League next season. (AFP)

<img alt="Bournemouth secured a 1-0 victory against Fulham, marking their first win in seven league matches. Photo: Action Images via Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800394_1_20250415082114.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Semenyo struck in the first minute as Bournemouth boosted their hopes of qualifying for continental competition with a 1-0 Premier League victory over fellow European hopefuls Fulham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forward Semenyo clinically pounced on an early error on Monday from Cottagers captain Antonee Robinson to claim his 10th goal of the season and earn the Cherries a first win in seven league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson went close to doubling the hosts' lead when he struck the woodwork before Andoni Iraola's men hung on to climb to eighth – above their opponents and Brighton on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ryan Sessegnon squandered the best of Fulham's chances to equalise – heading straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth had taken just two points from a possible 18 during a dramatic drop-off in form since going fifth with a 3-1 success at Southampton on February 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they were ahead inside a minute against their London opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Scott led the counter attack following a loose pass from Timothy Castagne and, after Robinson's mistake, Semenyo nipped in to cut inside Joachim Andersen and curl the ball into the bottom-left corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evanilson rattled the crossbar from close range in the 16th minute while Fulham also looked dangerous going forward during an entertaining first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth boss Iraola brought on Illia Zabarnyi for Marcos Senesi at half-time and his side nearly doubled their lead 10 minutes after the re-start, when the legs of goalkeeper Bernd Leno denied Tyler Adams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham manager Silva made three changes, bringing on Tom Cairney, Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez, with Sessegnon, Sander Berge and Rodrigo Muiz withdrawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth stopper Kepa clawed away an Alex Iwobi effort and comfortably saved from Sasa Lukic as the visitors pushed for a leveller.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, VAR deemed Leno got fingertips to the ball when Evanilson went down in the box seeking a penalty, 10 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts comfortably held on during seven minutes of added time to claim an overdue victory – their first at home since thrashing Nottingham Forest 5-0 in January – and put their European push back on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All season long we have been grinding and beating the top six teams," Bournemouth goalscorer Semenyo told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This little phase we are going through, losing and drawing, every team goes through that but that is why this win is so important.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like what we have done this year we do definitely deserve the European places." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paige Bueckers was chosen by the Dallas Wings with the number one pick in the WNBA draft on Monday, crowning a successful season that saw her lead the University of Connecticut to the US college championship this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old point guard had been the overwhelming favourite to be selected first by the Wings, and will enter a league that has surged in popularity in the past year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just an overwhelming sense of gratitude, it's super surreal just being here," Bueckers said moments after her selection at a ceremony in New York before paying tribute to her coaches and teammates at Connecticut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All their hard work helped me get to this stage," Bueckers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't do it alone – it took a village.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking before the draft, Bueckers told ESPN reaching the WNBA marked the realisation of a near-lifelong dream.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since I was five, it's the reason I played the game," she told the network.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ever since I picked up the ball I had big dreams."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bueckers enjoyed a fairytale final season in collegiate basketball, leading the Huskies to a blowout 82-59 win over the South Carolina Gamecocks on April 6 after missing most of the previous two seasons with injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't even put into words everything that's happened this past week, the entire year, the journey," she told ESPN on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It didn't really hit me until I saw the stage today. It's just surreal."
  <br>
  <br>
  A year after Caitlin Clark's rise took college basketball and the WNBA by storm, Bueckers has enjoyed a similarly meteoric journey to the world's top women's basketball league.
  <br>
  <br>
  US sports equipment giant Nike made her the first college athlete to have a sneaker named after them, and she has also signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Gatorade.

  Speaking after leading UConn to the college title this month, Bueckers said her success had been shaped by her determination to fight through a litany of injuries that included a torn meniscus in 2021 and a torn anterior cruciate ligament in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a story of resilience, of gratitude, of adversity, of overcoming adversity, just responding to life's challenges," she said of her career trajectory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To be shaped, to be the person that I am today ... obviously you feel like on the other side of a really hard time is a really big blessing."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other early draft selections on Monday, French teenager Dominique Malonga was chosen with the second pick by the Seattle Storm.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's amazing to me," the 6ft 6in 19-year-old Olympic silver medalist said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so happy to represent France, but not only France, Cameroon and Congo. I'm a multicultural person. I will work very hard to fit in this league, because I know it's gonna be tough."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim insists he understands the criticism levelled at him and his team after another Premier League loss at Newcastle United but claims losing games is worse than any personal condemnation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side were beaten on Sunday for the 14th time in the league this season – matching the number of defeats they suffered in the entire 2023-2024 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  United did put together some encouraging passages of play at St James' Park but Harvey Barnes' double, capitalising on some generous defending, left Amorim's team languishing down in 14th in the standings with six games left.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I understand [criticism] but I don't care," Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing is worse than losing games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People can say whatever they want to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't want to defend myself or anything like that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you look at our position in the table, it says it all."
  <br>
  <br>
  On course for their worst-ever Premier League points haul, Amorim made five changes to his starting XI, with a crucial Europa League quarter-final second leg against Olympique Lyonnais to come on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  One change grabbed the headlines after first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana was left out of the squad, with Altay Bayindir handed his Premier League debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Turkey international struggled, however, with his error gifting Newcastle their fourth goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even if we put a different XI we don't know the result," Amorim added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we had to make choices, we played three days ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to analyse the game, but we need to focus on the next one, we cannot change this one, the next one is massive for us, so let's focus on the next one on Thursday to play better and to win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other key games, Liverpool are within touching distance of the Premier League title after Virgil van Dijk sealed a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz's first-half strike at Anfield was cancelled out by Andrew Robertson's late own goal, but van Dijk headed Liverpool's winner in the closing moments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side are 13 points clear of second-placed Arsenal with six games left.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Molineux, Tottenham hit a new low as Wolves virtually sealed their survival with a vibrant 4-2 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham travel to Eintracht Frankfurt for the quarter-final second leg on Thursday after being held to a 1-1 draw by the German team in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves are 14 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich, who look destined for relegation despite holding Chelsea to a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 James Harden scored 39 points as the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors 124-119 in overtime to clinch the final playoff spot in a thrilling last day of the NBA regular season on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Harden's superb display in San Francisco helped the Clippers bag the fifth seed in the Western Conference and sets up a first-round postseason series with the fourth-seeded Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Harden's points tally included two crucial back-to-back three-pointers in overtime which ultimately proved decisive in a back-and-forth duel that saw the lead change hands 23 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat for Golden State means the Warriors must now secure their place in the playoffs via the four-team play-in tournament starting this week, hosting Memphis on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden meanwhile praised the Clippers' composure in closing out victory in front of the Warriors' vociferous home support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew it was gonna be a hostile environment, and the main goal was just to win the game," Harden told ESPN. "Whether it's scoring, whether it's playmaking...it's whatever it takes at this point."
  <br>
  <br>
  The win was the Clippers' eighth straight victory to close out the regular season, ensuring they will enter the playoffs as the form team in the Western Conference after a campaign where few gave them much hope.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know we're a good team and we're excited to show the world that we're a good team," Harden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Harden was backed with 33 points from Kawhi Leonard while Ivica Zubac added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Curry led Golden State's scoring with 36 points while Jimmy Butler added 30 points.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy beat Justin Rose on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff at the Masters on Sunday to become the sixth player, and first European, to complete the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors.
 <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy, who squandered a four-shot lead on the back nine during regulation, wasted no time in the playoff as he stuffed his approach at the par-four 18th two feet from the cup for a tap-in birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  For McIlroy, who was making his 11th attempt at completing the Grand Slam, the feat marked a crowing achievement in his career and delivered his first major title since August 2014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Northern Irishman had a chance to seal the win in regulation but missed a five-foot par putt at the 18th hole where Rose had earlier closed his round with a 20-footer for birdie. (Reuters)

    Alcaraz sees off Musetti to win Monte Carlo Masters

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz had to come from behind to beat Lorenzo Musetti. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800189_1_20250413204452.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory over the Italian Lorenzo Musetti.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marks a sixth Masters title for the 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam winner, and his most prestigious title since winning Wimbledon last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time," said Alcaraz, who lost in his first match on his only previous appearance at the tournament in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm really proud of my myself for how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coming here and seeing how all the hard work has paid off, I'm really happy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, who will move up a place in the rankings and displace Alexander Zverev at number 2, had to come from behind to beat the Italian, who had already taken down two Top 10 players, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, on his way to his first Masters 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musetti dropped his opening service but then fought his way back into the first set as Alcaraz appeared at odds with his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard bounced back, however, lifting his game as he galloped through the second set 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  That trend continued as Musetti began to have problems with his right leg, receiving treatment when he was 0-3 in the decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  He battled on but could not live with the intensity or physicality of Alcaraz's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches," said Alcaraz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done, to end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some consolation for Musetti is a rise to number 11 in the rankings and the promise of more to come on the clay as the season builds towards the French Open at Roland Garros next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably one of my best tournaments so far," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet made a triumphant return to international competition, securing their first Badminton Asia Championships mixed doubles title in Ningbo.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duo, pairing up for the first time since December's World Tour Finals, overcame Japan's Hiroki Midorikawa and Natsu Saito in a thrilling final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong pair started strong, taking the opening game 21-15, but their Japanese world number 11 opponents rallied to claim the second game 21-17 to set up a decider.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was proved to be the SAR pair's day as they dominated the third game, winning eight consecutive points at one stage en route to a 21-13 win, lifting the Asian title for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marks Hong Kong's second mixed doubles gold at the event after Reginald Lee and Chau Hoi-wah won it 11 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse came into the final riding high on confidence, having pulled off a semi-final upset over China's top-ranked Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rory McIlroy raced out to the best start the Masters has seen in its 91-year history, with six straight 3s on his scorecard that shot him into the lead on Saturday and left him 18 holes away from that coveted green jacket and the career Grand Slam.
 <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy chipped in for eagle as part of his amazing start. And then he delivered another eagle late in the round as contenders were lining up behind him, a majestic 6-iron to 6 feet on the par-5 15th hole that carried him to a second straight 6-under 66.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was an awesome day and puts me in a great position going into tomorrow,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He led by two shots over a familiar foe — Bryson DeChambeau, who delivered some magic of his own with a 45-foot birdie putt to start his round and a putt from nearly 50 feet for birdie on the 18th hole that gave him a 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was DeChambeau who crushed McIlroy’s spirit last year at Pinehurst No. 2 by beating him at the US Open, stretching McIlroy's drought in the majors to more than a decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also familiar to McIlroy was his position going into the final day at Augusta National .
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 14 years ago when McIlroy, a 21-year-old with long, curly locks and unlimited potential, took a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters. What followed was a meltdown that left him in tears when he shot 80.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I just have to stay firm and just stay in my own little world,” McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He hasn't had a better chance at that green jacket until this week, when he recovered from two double bogeys in the opening round and responded with rounds of 66-66.
  <br>
  <br>
  At stake on Sunday is a chance to become only the sixth player to capture all four professional majors, a feat last accomplished nearly 25 years ago by Tiger Woods at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners, who went from a five-shot deficit to one shot behind McIlroy in a span of three holes on this wild Saturday, closed with eight straight pars for a 70. He was in third place, four shots behind.
  <br>
  <br>
  No one else was closer than six shots of McIlroy. Justin Rose, who had a one-shot lead at the start of the day, shot 75 and was seven shots back. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrated pole position for the Bahrain Grand Prix, his 50th Formula One race, while dejected championship-leading teammate Lando Norris qualified sixth and said he had been "clueless on track".
 <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes rival George Russell was second fastest at the floodlit Sakhir desert circuit but was then handed a one-place grid drop, promoting Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to the front row instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italian rookie teammate Andrea Kimi Antonelli collected a similar penalty, after Mercedes released their drivers too early from a red flag stoppage, and dropped to fifth while Alpine's Pierre Gasly moved up to fourth on the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've felt confident out there pretty much all weekend," said Piastri, who was also fastest in two out of three practice sessions and lapped with a best time of one minute 29.841 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted but I still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Piastri, winner in China from pole, could become the first double winner of the season and looks set to slash the 13-point gap to Norris, who is only one clear of Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said the Australian deserved his pole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is amazing, as good as it has been all season which is strong. Just I have been off it all weekend," Norris told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why, just clueless on track at the minute. Just not quick enough, simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The only positive for Norris was having Verstappen end up in seventh place for Red Bull at a track where the four-times champion was utterly dominant last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he had been struggling with the brakes and lack of grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea where we will be in terms of race pace. We'll be in the middle of the pack so hopefully a bit of excitement," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlos Sainz qualified eighth for Williams, at a track where he was quickest in pre-season testing, with Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton ninth and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time this season that both Red Bulls had reached the top 10 shootout, although they flirted with an early exit in Q1 and Q2 when they left it until the last minute to set a time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously as a driver you want more but considering what I had in practice, and it’s only my second race (for Red Bull), I’ll still take it," said Tsunoda, who replaced Liam Lawson after the opening two races.
  <br>
  <br>
  Esteban Ocon crashed his Haas in the second phase, triggering red flags after he careered backwards across the gravel into the barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman took his time clambering out and was taken away in the medical car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian rookie Jack Doohan qualified his Alpine 11th, his best session yet, and one place ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Albon failed to make it through the opening phase for the first time this season, the Williams driver qualifying only 16th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albon was then promoted to 15th when Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg had his lap deleted for exceeding track limits while already taking part in a second phase he was then excluded from.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards said they had been informed of the violation too late to stop him progressing at Albon's expense.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hadjar's teammate Lawson had another difficult evening and was only 17th. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin De Bruyne sparked Manchester City’s remarkable fightback from two goals down in a 5-2 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday that re-ignited his team’s Champions League qualification hopes.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old De Bruyne curled a free kick in off the post to begin the comeback in the 33rd minute and had a hand in goals by Omar Marmoush and Mateo Kovacic in the first half. James McAtee added a fourth, off a pass from goalkeeper Ederson, who later came off injured before fellow academy product Nico O’Reilly wrapped up the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a display showing the enduring quality of De Bruyne, who announced last week he would be leaving City at the end of the season after 10 years at the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injuries have affected the Belgium playmaker's impact in recent seasons but his class can still shine through, with his assist for Kovacic the 119th of his Premier League career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eberechi Eze and Chris Richards scored in the first 21 minutes for Palace to shock City into action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory lifted City into fourth place above Chelsea and Newcastle, who have games in hand in the race to secure England's five Champions League spots. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Rose remained atop a star-studded leaderboard after the second round of the Masters on Friday , with defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau all within three shots of the lead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rose followed his opening 65 with a 1-under 71 that left him 8 under for the tournament. He was one ahead of DeChambeau , the reigning US Open champion, whose rounds of 69-68 have him firmly in the mix for his first green jacket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking of first green jackets, McIlroy is in good shape to finally get his own. He had the low round of the day, a 6-under 66 to get to 6 under for the tournament. McIlroy needs only the Masters to complete the career grand slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners also was at 6 under, and Scheffler was in a group another shot back that included Shane Lowry, Matt McCarty and Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler dropped a shot at the par-4 finishing hole, which played the toughest on the course Friday. (AP)

<img alt="Mohamed Salah says the prospect of winning before a full Enfield is what drives him crazy every day. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799966_1_20250411175726.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah said he is driven every day to deliver Premier League glory to Liverpool this season after signing a new two-year contract on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah, 32, has defied the distraction of months of speculation over his future by scoring 27 goals and providing 17 assists in the 31 league appearances to help open up an 11-point lead at the top of the table with seven games to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian was part of the Liverpool side that delivered the club's first league title for 30 years in the 2019/20 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Covid restrictions meant that the Reds lifted the trophy in front of an empty Anfield and there was no parade through the city's streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I said in the beginning of the season, I just want to win the Premier League more than anything else," Salah told Liverpool's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want it so bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we owe that to the fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They deserve it, they deserve to enjoy it after that long time, with celebrating at Anfield and in the street and just enjoying ourselves winning the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said "that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said news of Salah's new deal may have come as a "pleasant surprise" for supporters but praised the club's sporting director Richard Hughes for ensuring the Egyptian remains at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer, of course, that things were heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend Mo Salah, who is such a great player as a free agent, that he can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he stayed at our club and that's also a compliment for Richard." (AFP)

<img alt="Ulrik Saltnes celebrates after breaking the deadlock against Lazio. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799883_2_20250411110636.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two goals from Ulrik Saltnes spurred Bodo/Glimt to a 2-0 home victory over Lazio in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lazio arrived on Thursday in a windy Bodo to find snow had blanketed the pitch in the early hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the artificial turf was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to the challenging zero-degree conditions in northern Norway, spending much of the match pinned back and on the defensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European Cup semi-final, Bodo/Glimt neutralised Lazio's defence, attacking the box time and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Lazio registered just a single shot on target throughout the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am incredibly pleased with a lot but I do not think we should get carried away," Bodo/Glimt coach Kjetil Knutsen told Viaplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a clear identity and an incredible strength within us. We should be happy with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts seized early control, with Jens Petter Hauge firing a clever, short shot in the opening minutes that Lazio keeper Christos Mandas had to stretch to push out of danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the half-hour mark, Bodo/Glimt came close again when Ole Didrik Blomberg received the ball inside the box but it slid off his foot as he prepared his shot and the effort went well wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt made the breakthrough just two minutes after the restart when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise short pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg to give the hosts the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the hosts looked to double their advantage, their sharp, quick passing continued to trouble the Lazio defence but several promising opportunities were squandered as they struggled to convert their finishing touches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt scored their second goal in the 69th minute when Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear it, the ball had already crossed the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lazio back-up keeper made another save in the last seconds from Odin Bjortuft's attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had speed in their exchanges because of the artificial pitch," Lazio manager Marco Baroni told Sky Sport Italia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the second leg will be a different game and qualification is still open."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be next Thursday at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers held Athletic Bilbao to a nail-biting goalless draw at home in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, despite being reduced to 10 men early on.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage on Thursday after Rangers defender Robin Propper was sent off in the 13th minute for a foul on Inaki Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, appearing in the last 16 of a major European competition for the first time since 2015-16, had a couple of clear-cut opportunities in the first half, with both Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet coming close.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, goalkeeper Liam Kelly produced a series of fine saves to keep them at bay as the Scottish Premiership side defended strongly and even threatened when Cyriel Dessers fired wide from long range.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was delayed for seven minutes in the second half due to an injury to 18-year-old Bailey Rice, who was carried off on a stretcher after taking a knock on the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao, who finished second in the league phase, thought they had broken the deadlock when substitute Alex Berenguer scored in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, however, was flagged offside after a VAR review but a penalty was awarded as the ball had bounced off the hand of defender James Tavernier before the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sending-off seemed pretty clear to me. I didn't see the penalty well though, but it seemed a bit strange," Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet at the last moment we lacked clarity and didn't manage to convert the spot kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The draw is not what we wanted considering they played with 10 men and we had chances," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Kelly again emerged as the hero with a crucial save from Berenguer to keep the result scoreless as Bilbao failed to score in a European game for the first time in their last 19 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was a proper Rangers performance," Rangers boss Barry Ferguson told TNT sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the exact reaction I wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's what I spoke about on Monday and the players tonight showed a performance full of heart, grit and determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played on Thursday at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao and the winners will face either Lyon or Manchester United, who drew 2-2 in the first leg, for a place in the final in Bilbao. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Billie Jean King Cup finals in Shenzhen have been brought forward from November to September, organisers announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event had already been reduced from 12 teams to eight, aligning with the men's Davis Cup Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifiers for the finals started on Thursday, with teams fighting for six tickets to China to join the hosts and defending champions Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescheduling from November to September aligns the event with the start of the WTA tournaments in Asia, supporting player calendar flow," the organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finals will get under way on September 16, with the final to be played on September 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy won their fifth title in the women's team event last year by defeating Slovakia in the final in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as world number 10 Elena Rybakina earlier in the day showed all her battling qualities to beat Kimberly Birrell 6-3 7-6(4) and give Kazakhstan an unassailable 2-0 lead over seven-times champions Australia in their Billie Jean King Cup qualifier in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, went down an early break in the Group D tie but cranked up her powerful forehand and drew level after six games before claiming the opening set on serve with a big ace at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birrell raced to a 5-1 lead in the next but squandered a set point and Rybakina clawed her way back with some ferocious shot-making to clinch victory via the tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a difficult match," said Rybakina, who secured her eighth victory in 10 singles matches since her debut in the competition in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to bring the win for the team ... it's always nice to be back in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yulia Putintseva defeated debutant Maya Joint 6-2 6-1 at Pat Rafter Arena to give Kazakhstan the early lead in the best-of-three matches contest. (AFP/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Thursday assured SAR fans that a “full team” including captain Bruno Fernandes will be featured in a friendly against Hong Kong, China next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the event was Ashley Westwood, head coach of the SAR football team, who said the squad would treat the friendly as preparation for their Asian Cup qualifier against India in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  ProEvents, organiser of the friendly, said there are contractual agreements in place to ensure the appearance of United's key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just heard from Manchester United's executive saying that they will be coming with the full team." said its chairman, Paul Kam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have also seen the list and they are coming, with obviously the first one being Bruno Fernandes, the captain. Together with [Alejandro Garnacho] and other players, they're all in there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for the friendly fixture will go on sale at noon on Friday via ticketing platform Cityline. They will be priced between HK$390 to HK$2,990.

    Alejandro Tabilo stuns Djokovic in Monte Carlo

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic rued a "horrible" performance as he crashed out of the Monte-Carlo Masters in his opening match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fifth-ranked Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the second round  on Wednesday, making an inauspicious start to his clay season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, 37, went into the tournament hampered by an eye infection that has been troubling him since the semi-finals in Miami at the end of March and admitting that he did not have "very high" expectations for Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  As it transpired a sluggish performance meant that Tabilo, who also beat Djokovic on clay in last year's Italian Open in Rome, faced few difficulties in claiming a rare 2-0 head-to-head record against the 24-time Grand Slam winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was actually more like the worst day [at the office]," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb, who is chasing his 100th ATP title, has not won a tournament since taking gold at last year's Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic brushed off any fitness concerns and said his main focus for the clay season was the French Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to play in Madrid later this month for the first time since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expected myself at least to have put a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible," said Djokovic, who has only once reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo since the last of his two titles in the principality in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But this bad, I didn't expect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tabilo, ranked 32 in the world, will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there," said Tabilo, who earned consecutive tour-level wins for the first time since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an unreal match." (AFP)

    2028 Olympics to make a splash with six new events

<img alt="Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799728_1_20250410112258.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme, with 50m backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke to be contested for the first time at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Previously, only freestyle was raced over the sport's shortest distance despite all four strokes being on the schedule at world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Wednesday of their inclusion for Los Angeles brings the swimming gold medal count to 41 from 35 at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there will be 55 medals awarded in aquatics – which also includes artistic swimming, water polo, diving, and open water – more than any other sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's decision is a testament to the continued evolution of swimming at the Olympic Games," said World Aquatics president Husain Al Musallam after the move was ratified by the International Olympic Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Including these six new events enhances the programme's balance and adds more opportunities for athletes to showcase their skills on the world's biggest stage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming is one only four sports contested at every Olympics since the first Games in 1896, alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics and fencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Australia have long been dominant in the pool, with the two nations again at the forefront in Paris last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC also announced that the number of female athletes competing in Los Angeles (5,333) will exceed men (5,167) for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows the women's football tournament being boosted to 16 teams. The men's competition has 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional women's weight category in boxing and two extra women's water polo teams ensure gender parity in those sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of new mixed-team events were also confirmed, including in golf, gymnastics and table tennis, while a 4x100m mixed relay was added to the track and field competition. (AFP)

<img alt="Luka Doncic and LeBron James keep things cool in the fourth quarter against the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799727_1_20250410111305.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic shrugged off the raw emotion of his return to Dallas with a dazzling 45-point display against his former club as the Los Angeles Lakers downed the Mavericks 112-97 to punch their ticket to the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers from Dallas in February in one of the most shocking trades in NBA history, was given a rousing reception by Mavs fans packed into the American Airlines Center to pay tribute to their former hero  on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pre-game video montage was screened in the arena just before Doncic was introduced to the sellout crowd of 20,841 fans, many wearing t-shirts bearing the words "Thanks for Everything", written in the 26-year-old's native Slovenian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic visibly teared up as he watched the tribute, and looked distraught as he was comforted by Lakers team-mate LeBron James moments before tip-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after that emotional pre-game ceremony, Doncic quickly snapped into game mode, swiftly getting into his scoring groove to give Mavericks fans a painful reminder of the generational talent that was traded away by the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic scored 14 in the first quarter alone, and added a further 17 in the second period to help the Lakers into a 60-57 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic's rate of scoring slowed in the second half, leaving James to produce a trademark fourth quarter burst to close out victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was still time for Doncic to sign off in style, nailing an imperious three-pointer to push the Lakers into a 108-94 lead shortly before exiting the game to a standing ovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The applause swiftly morphed into chants of "Fire Nico" – a reference to the Dallas general manager Nico Harrison who has been roundly criticised by Mavs for engineering the trade that sent Doncic to Los Angeles in exchange for Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic later admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like 'There's no way I'm playing this game'," he told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were so many emotions I can't even explain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brought tears to my eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here as a young kid, aged 18, and they made me feel like it was home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just a lot of great memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love these fans, I love this city but it's time to move on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory means the Lakers, who improved to 49-31, can clinch third seed in the Western Conference if they win one of their final two regular-season games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic's 45 points included seven three-pointers from 16-of-28 shooting, while James finished with 27 points, seven rebounds and three assists. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona coach Hansi Flick warned their Champions League rivals his team are still looking to improve after beating Borussia Dortmund 4-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans put one foot into the semi-finals with the first leg thrashing of last year's runners-up at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca are the competition's top scorers with 36 goals and their dynamic attacking trio of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Lamine Yamal strike fear into the hearts of opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to keep improving, today we saw some points we can improve on," Flick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will analyse this game and I will tell the players they did very well, but there are still things to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy with the result today but it's just the first step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted his 12th Champions League goal of the season – he is the top scorer in the competition – and added two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian has 19 direct goal contributions this season in Europe, equalling former Barca great Lionel Messi's record for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always thought he's an extraordinary player... the team is set on his shoulders, his dynamism," said the coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  His opposite number Niko Kovac was disappointed with Dortmund's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a deserved defeat [but] we could have got a goal, as we all know the return leg will be very difficult," said Kovac.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am optimistic but I have to be a realist... it was a very big result, our chances of going through are minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know it will be difficult but we have to have a spark of hope, because without that spark it will be impossible." (AFP)

<img alt="Khvicha Kvaratskhelia runs a gauntlet of four Aston Villa players to give PSG the lead in their quarterfinal first-leg match in Paris. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799721_1_20250410104557.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa coach Unai Emery insists he still believes his side can get the better of Paris Saint-Germain and reach the Champions League semi-finals despite a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of their last-eight tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa took the lead in the first half in Paris through Morgan Rogers, only for the hosts to turn the game on its head thanks to stunning strikes by Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia either side of the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a Nuno Mendes effort in stoppage time, which gives PSG a two-goal cushion to take to Villa Park for the return leg, appears to leave Emery's side with a huge task to turn the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 2-1 we were thinking about playing to win in the next match, and at 3-1 it is still the same," Emery said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are here and enjoying it, and I am very proud of the players. We competed fantastically and we were close to getting a good result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end, with this goal, it is still more or less the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Villa Park is our home, and hopefully there we will be stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But of course they are still favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They showed their power and individual quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second leg will be just as difficult at 3-1 as it was at 2-1. We have to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emery's opposite number, Luis Enrique, expressed delight but emphasised that PSG would not sit back and "speculate" in the second leg on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quality of PSG's goals was exceptional, with Doue's marvellous strike for the equaliser probably topped by Kvaratskhelia's remarkable individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendes then rounded Emiliano Martinez to make it 3-1 following a superb Ousmane Dembele pass, capping PSG's victory in a game that saw them enjoy 68 percent possession and 30 attempts on goal to Villa's eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our objective in Birmingham is clear, to try to win the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how to speculate, or to sit back and defend deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will try to have the ball and attack more than the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't doubt it will be harder there but that is what we will try to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG will have skipper Marquinhos available again to line up in central defence in the return after he sat out the first leg due to suspension. (AFP)

 Hong Kong, China Sanda martial artist Leung Yu-hong triumphed at the 10th Sanda World Cup in Jiangyin, claiming gold in the men’s 60-kilos category.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory adds to his historic 2023 achievement, when he secured Hong Kong’s first-ever Sanda gold at the World Wushu Championships in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanda, also referred to as Sanshou, is a Chinese combat sport blending traditional kung fu techniques - such as strikes, kicks, throws and grappling - with modern fighting tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team further showcased its prowess at the biennial event, earning three additional medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunny Cheung secured silver in the men’s 70-kilos division, while Cai Jia-hao and Chan Tsz-ching added bronze medals to the team’s haul in the men's over 90-kilogrammes and the women's 56-kilogrammes respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biennial world cup saw participation from 26 countries and regions, with nearly 170 athletes competing.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's 3-0 win over Real Madrid means at least five Premier League teams will play in next season's Champions League, the English top flight confirmed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top four sides in the Premier League automatically qualify for Europe's top club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But due to the success of English clubs in the three European competitions, England is now guaranteed a top-two placing in Uefa's association club coefficient rankings, which earns a European Performance Spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  England lead the way, with Spain and Italy next on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five English teams are involved in the quarter-finals of the various European competitions – Arsenal and Aston Villa in the Champions League, Manchester United and Tottenham in the Europa League and Chelsea in the Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League could potentially have as many as seven clubs in next season's Champions League – the top five teams in the league, plus the Champions League winners and the Europa League winners if they finish outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are almost certain to win the Premier League and Arsenal, in second, are well-placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there is a scrap for the remaining Champions League spots, with just six points separating third-placed Nottingham Forest from Villa, in seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal shocked 15-time European champions Real Madrid 3-0 on Tuesday in the first leg of their quarter-final, with Villa in action against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 42 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder bounced back to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 136-120 in a hard-fought battle that saw Luka Doncic controversially ejected in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after suffering a 27-point defeat to the Lakers, the No 1-ranked Thunder avenged that loss on Tuesday thanks to Gilgeous-Alexander's 13th 40-point game of the season, with Jalen Williams adding 26 and Lugentz Dort 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest pivoted on the fourth quarter incident that led to the Lakers' Slovenian star Doncic picking up a second technical foul and being tossed from the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic was ejected following a one-handed jump shot that put the Lakers 108-107 up with 7min 40sec remaining after officiating crew member J T Orr judged he had been verbally abused by the player following the bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic protested, arguing he had merely been responding to a fan at courtside who had heckled him, but the decision stood and clearly rattled the Lakers, allowing the Thunder to seize the initiative and pull away for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great game that unfortunately didn't get the finish that I think every basketball fan would want because of some decision making on some individuals' parts," Lakers coach J J Redick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James, who finished with 28 points, was at a loss to explain Doncic's ejection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why the ref was taking it personal," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ref took it upon himself to think it was versus him. The game was just weird as hell after that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic insisted he had not been trash-talking Orr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nothing to do with the ref, so I didn't really understand it," Doncic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, but you know that's on me too. I can't let my team down like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers remain in third place with a 48-31 record and need to win two of their remaining three regular-season fixtures to lock in third seeding in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers clinched N.1 seeding in the NBA Eastern Conference playoffs after cruising past the Chicago Bulls 135-113.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland led the scoring with 28 points in a balanced offensive performance from the Cavs, who improved to 63-16 to ensure they will finish the regular season on top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensures Cleveland will have home advantage when the playoffs get under way next week following the completion of the regular season on Sunday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top seed Alexander Zverev crashed out in his opening match of the Monte-Carlo Masters with Italy's Matteo Berrettini as defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and Britain's Jack Draper both advanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Zverev has struggled for any kind of form since his defeat by Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final at the end of January, winning just six of 12 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with a first-round bye in the absence of world number one Sinner, who is suspended for a doping violation until May 4, Zverev was among the favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a controlled start to the game, the German slumped to a 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 defeat to 34th-ranked Berrettini, at the end of a high-flying match, which had included an impressive 48-stroke rally won by the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been the worst period since my injury [the] last few months," said Zverev who has suffered a string of early exits of late, including at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a great first set, and once I got broken in the second set I play ten levels down. My ball is much slower. I stopped hitting the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same story the last few months. Nothing changes. So it's me who lost the match, once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought my level was terrible, but that's just my opinion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion and three-time Monte Carlo winner Tsitsipas advanced past 38th-ranked Australian Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a lacklustre US tour, the Dubai winner won through 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in his second round tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Wells champion Draper, seeded fifth, eased past 45th-ranked American Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Novak Djokovic – the winner in 2013 and 2015 – and Carlos Alcaraz start their campaigns on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An 88th-minute Davide Frattesi goal took Inter Milan to a 2-1 win at Bayern Munich, giving the Italians the edge after the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Undermanned Bayern, nursing a bulging casualty ward, set the tone in the first half-hour on Tuesday, with Michael Olise and Harry Kane narrowly failing to break through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter opened the scoring on the 38-minute mark when Marcus Thuram's clever back-heel found Lautaro Martinez who blasted home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italians maintained control until Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller, days after announcing a summer departure after 25 years at the club, scored the equaliser with a typical poacher's finish with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not content to be spectators to a Bayern fairytale ending, Inter broke on the counter just three minutes later, with Carlos Augusto finding Frattesi, who scored Inter's second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter, defeated in the final by Manchester City two seasons ago, have their noses in front in their bid to make the last four of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter goalscorer Martinez toasted the "complete performance", telling Amazon Prime his side showed "character, personality", adding "the boys showed what they were made of".
  <br>
  <br>
  The late goal consigned Bayern to their first home defeat in the Champions League since 2021, a run of 22 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Champions League winner Mueller lamented Inter's "stupid" late goal, saying "when we watch the footage, when we analyse it, we'll know we could have done better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't a brutal defeat. We've played the first half, the first leg – we imagined a different result but we know there's still something in it for us." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal defied the odds with their stunning 3-0 win against Real Madrid as Declan Rice's free-kick magic left the Champions League holders in disarray.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rice inspired one of the greatest results in Arsenal's storied history with two blistering free-kicks in the second half of the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the third goal for Arteta's side as they moved within touching distance of a first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an incredible moment for England midfielder Rice, who had never scored a free-kick in his career – a period spanning 338 previous matches – before the first of his thunderbolts flashed past Real keeper Thibaut Courtois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had also failed to find the net from a direct set-piece in almost four years, with their last coming via Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunners captain Odegaard put his hands on his head in disbelief when Rice completed his set-piece double, while Arteta was equally surprised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Declan's been very determined because we have said in the last few months that we have not scored a direct free-kick in three-and-half years," the Arsenal manager said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and of that quality from the same player, a player that has never scored a free-kick before in his career, what are the odds?
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a player who can do it, how clean he strikes it it's Declan. But you have to execute it at the highest level. And against one of the best keepers in the world as well. It's amazing."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a cathartic result for Arsenal, who have endured a rocky season marred by their failure to keep pace with Liverpool in the Premier League title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are 11 points adrift of Liverpool, leaving the Champions League as their last chance this season to win a first trophy since the 2020 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Few would have expected them to get past 15-time European champions Real before the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  But now Arsenal will travel to the Bernabeu for the return tie next week as firm favourites to progress to a last four clash against Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Mullins has been given an eight-day suspension after he was found to have breached whip rules when riding Nick Rockett to Grand National glory on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish amateur rider steered the eight-year-old to victory in the celebrated steeplechase at the Aintree course in Liverpool to complete a notable family double, given 33-1 shot Nick Rockett is trained by his father, Willie Mullins.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the race, Willie Mullins, who achieved the impressive feat of saddling the first three home in the world's most famous jumps race, in addition to being the father of the winning rider, said: "This is the best day ever, this will never be topped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary officials, however, found Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Grand National is deemed to be a Class One race under British rules, the usual penalty of four days for such an offence was doubled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Mullins was, therefore, suspended for eight days in April and May.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result of the Grand National remained unaltered, however, as is often the case with whip offences in British horseracing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a situation critics believe encourages jockeys to break the rules, particularly in showpiece races such as the Grand National, rather than face the possible anger of owners, trainers and punters who might otherwise claim their horse has not been 'ridden out' fully in a finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, mired in a four-game losing streak as the NBA playoffs approach, fired coach Michael Malone on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Malone led the Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023, but despite the exploits of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets have struggled for consistency this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are fourth in a tight Western Conference race with four teams just a half-game behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Denver Nuggets have relieved head coach Michael Malone of his duties and will not extend general manager Calvin Booth," the Nuggets said in a statement, adding that assistant coach David Adelman will assume head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets have three games remaining in the regular season, which concludes on Sunday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Referees at this year's Club World Cup will be equipped with body cameras and instructed to implement new rules to cut down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, Fifa announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by Ifab, the sport's lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the offence is rarely penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Florida and Walter Clayton somehow overcame Houston’s tough defence on Monday night to carve out a 65-63 victory in an NCAA title-game thriller which was not decided until Clayton’s own D stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was getting Houston’s Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning three points in the final seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for travelling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, and they won their third overall title and first since 2007, this time led by third-year coach Todd Golden.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Daniil Medvedev navigated his way into the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Monday, eventually seeing off former world number eight Karen Khachanov 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open winner Medvedev fought through in just shy of three hours on Court Rainier III against Khachanov, after having been a set and a break up on his fellow Russian.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an early exit from the Miami Open last month caused the 29-year-old to exit the top 10, Medvedev got back to winning ways on clay as he chases his first title since claiming the Rome Open two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, 11th seed Ben Shelton was stunned by 42nd-ranked Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and there will be no showdown between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka after the Swiss was defeated by Alejandro Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton went down 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-1 to his Spanish opponent, who reached the 2022 final at Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wild card Wawrinka also played out an epic that lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours before succumbing 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Chile's Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Gael Monfils beat Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and Matteo Berrettini set up a second-round meeting with top seed Alexander Zverev after winning in straight sets against Mariano Navone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Auger-Aliassime went down to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, but fellow top 20 player Lorenzo Musetti avoided a similar fate by coming back from a set down to defeat qualifier Bu Yunchaokete of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic beat American Sebastian Korda and Marcos Giron overcame fellow North American Denis Shapovalov, both in straight sets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle coasted to a 3-0 win over sorry Leicester on Monday to step up their Champions League charge and condemn the Foxes to an eighth straight Premier League defeat without scoring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, still on a high after winning the League Cup last month, are up to fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea but with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth place will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season after strong performances by English clubs in continental competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But relegation for Ruud van Nistelrooy's hapless team is all but certain after a solitary season in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 2-0 up in the 11th minute after two goals from Jacob Murphy, the second a tap-in from close range after an audacious effort from Fabian Schar hit the crossbar, and Harvey Barnes added a third before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester last scored a league goal in front of their own fans against Brighton on December 8 and they are the first side in football league history to lose eight home league games in a row without scoring a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle boss Howe said his "biggest challenge" had been maintaining focus after the club ended their 56-year trophy drought in the League Cup final against Liverpool last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't compliment them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a very down to earth, humble group who want to do well and represent the club in the right way. They have shown that in the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe said the race for the Champions League was "going to hot up".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next week for us is a big week. We have three really tough games (against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa) and that will go a long way in seeing where we are at the end of the season." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton have sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, the club announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were condemned to relegation in record time after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric's bottom-of-the-table side have lost 25 of their 31 top-flight games in a wretched campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation with seven fixtures left gives Southampton, last season's Championship play-off winners, an unwanted Premier League record, surpassing Derby and Huddersfield's relegations with six games left in 2008 and 2019 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric took over from Russell Martin in December, with Southampton already deep in trouble, but the 49-year-old won only one league match, at Ipswich in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints have lost seven of their past eight league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that we have today reached an agreement with our men's first-team manager, Ivan Juric, to end his spell at the club," said a Southampton statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, we haven't seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Rusk will take charge of the team as interim manager for the remainder of the season and will be assisted by Adam Lallana. (AFP)

<img alt="Novak Djokovic says his eye infection began during the recent Miami Open semi-finals. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799230_1_20250407125952.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World No 5 Novak Djokovic, a finalist at the recent Miami Masters, said he did not have high expectations for the Monte Carlo Masters as he was suffering from the effects of an eye infection.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic is a two-time winner in Monte Carlo but has not won any title since taking the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard courts of Miami marked a return to form even though the 37-year-old lost the final in straight sets to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm glad that I found at least in Miami that joy on the court and, I feel, performance level," said the former world No 1 on Sunday ahead of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's see if I can carry that into clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a completely different surface and I didn't have much time to get used to this tournament, so my expectations are not really high for the results here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's more about trying to get matches and as many as possible, and obviously try to peak towards the end of the clay season which is, of course, most importantly in Paris."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French Open, which takes place on the red clay of Roland Garros between May 25 and May 8, is the second Grand Slam event of the season, following the Australian Open where Djokovic reached the semi-finals before bowing out, injured, to Alexander Zverev.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb admitted, however, that the eye infection and "a little bit of a viral infection" that he has been dealing with over the last week made him think twice about competing in Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It started in semi-finals day in Miami and I did struggle with it in the finals but it's calming down, I guess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm visiting the doctor later today so let's see. It should be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a first round bye, Djokovic will face a second round match against either the Chilean Alejandro Tabilo or another veteran of the circuit, three-time Grand Slam winner Stanislas Wawrinka. (AFP)

    Alcaraz admits Sinner pressure getting to him

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz says he is at peace with not being able to displace Jannik Sinner from his top ranking. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799227_1_20250407124847.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz said pressure to reclaim the world number one ranking from the suspended Jannik Sinner has had a negative impact on his form this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing," Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's my mindset right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th NHL career goal, etching his name into ice hockey history by finally passing the previous all-time record he shared with Wayne Gretzky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington Capitals ace Ovechkin – who had tied Gretzky's 26-year-old mark with two goals on Friday – scored on a power play early in the second period of Sunday's clash at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old Russian icon smashed in a long-range shot with 12:34 remaining in the second period to spark wild celebrations at the UBS Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overjoyed Ovechkin dived along the ice in delight after his momentous strike, before being mobbed by team-mates as a packed arena rose in a standing ovation to the Russian's achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice hockey's "Great One" Gretzky was in attendance along with National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman to witness Ovechkin's history-making strike, which was greeted by deafening chants of "Ovi, Ovi".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin meanwhile celebrated with his mother, wife and children, who came on to the ice as play was halted to mark the occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," Ovechkin said in an address to the stadium after play was stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, it's a team sport and without my boys, the whole organisation, the fans, the trainers, I would never stand here. I would never have passed 'The Great One'," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So fellas, thank you very much, I love you so much...And the last thing – to all of you fans around the world, in Russia, we did it boys."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky meanwhile also spoke in tribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that," the Canadian told the crowd. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side must improve "everywhere" after a dismal derby against Manchester City ended 0-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance as they remain fifth in the Premier League, which should be enough to reach next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third," said Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A contest devoid of quality, intensity or fight summed up a dreadful season for both sides of the Manchester divide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct," said United captain Bruno Fernandes. "In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened," said Guardiola. "We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacle did marginally improve after the break as Omar Marmoush's powerful effort from a corner stung the palms of Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount's introduction off the bench added more thrust to the United attack in the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had a chance to win it when Zirkzee's shot was clawed away by Ederson and Rico Lewis did well to get in the way of Mount's follow-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were smiles during a warm embrace between Guardiola and Amorim at full-time but those pleasantries disguised the fact that neither man can be happy with the state of their sides after a disappointing campaign. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers produced a devastating display of long-range shooting to score a surprising 126-99 blowout over the No1 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder.
 <br>
  <br>
  A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile said the Lakers had been determined not to let up after making a fast start against the Western Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA," James said. "They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves meanwhile believes the result augured well for the final week of the regular season, which reaches its conclusion on April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge," Reaves said. "The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boston Celtics meanwhile kept their slim hopes of grabbing No1 seed from Cleveland with a 124-90 rout of the Washington Wizards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said on Sunday that foreign elite runners arrived to take part in the first Pyongyang Marathon in six years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Athletes from China, Romania and other countries arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage from KCNA showed hundreds of runners taking off from the stadium track starting point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon is part of celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung in 1912 and is the largest international sporting event in North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offers a rare opportunity for visitors to run through the streets of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon course winds through central Pyongyang, passing key landmarks and heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, before returning back to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last edition of the Pyongyang Marathon was held in 2019 before the pandemic, during which the state sealed its borders in an effort to contain the virus. (Agencies)

<img alt="Max Verstappen celebrates the win on the podium at Suzuka, Japan. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799114_1_20250406151250.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen led from pole to chequered flag to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, his first victory of the 2025 season, with McLaren's Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough. The McLarens were pushing me very hard," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a lot of fun but not easy pushing the tyres. I am incredibly happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting on pole made it possible to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with RB's Isack Hadjar next ahead of Williams' Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th in his first race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, having started from 14th on the grid in his home grand prix. Lawson was 17th for RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen and Norris were involved in a flashpoint midway through the race as the two front-runners emerged from a pit stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris drew up alongside Verstappen but the Dutchman refused to budge and Norris was forced onto the grass before sliding back onto the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said "he forced me off" but Verstappen told his team that he was not to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He drove himself onto the grass," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards reviewed the incident and decided not to investigate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has struggled to get to grips with his Red Bull this season, finishing second in Australia and fourth in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pulled off a lap for the ages in qualifying in Suzuka, pipping Norris to claim his first pole of the season in a track-record time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen got away cleanly from Norris and Piastri at the first turn, with little change in the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman quickly established control by laying down the fastest lap and his lead grew over the early part of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen-year-old rookie Antonelli briefly took the lead while Verstappen and Norris were in the pits, to become Formula One's youngest-ever race leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen soon reclaimed the lead and his team gave him the green light to push until the end of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two McLarens stayed on his tail, with Piastri telling his team "I have the pace to get Max" but Verstappen could not be caught.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Suzuka had been dry all week, with a series of small trackside fires halting practice several times but rain early on Sunday removed any chance of a repeat in the race. (AFP)

 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior came up just short at the Dubai Turf, as trainer Danny Shum's champion was edged by the slimmest of margins by Soul Rush from Japan in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jockey James McDonald and the SAR's runners were among the leading pack for much of the 1,800 metre Grade One course, and led almost the entire way after the turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they were overtaken by jockey Cristian Demuro's Soul Rush on virtually the last stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his three-race trip in the Middle East, Romantic Warrior won the Jebel Hatta in Dubai and was also runner-up in the Saudi Cup in Riyadh.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's faint hopes of catching Premier League leaders Liverpool are almost over after their 1-1 draw at Everton, while Aston Villa bolstered their bid for Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a frantic finale, Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke was shown a red card for his foul on Daichi Kamada.

 Thomas Müller will leave Bayern Munich this summer after a 25-year career at the German club.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Müller said on Saturday, in a joint announcement with Bayern, that his “incredible journey” with his boyhood club will end in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder's contract is set to expire after the season and he's seen limited game time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s clear that today is not like any other day for me," Müller said. "My 25 years as an FC Bayern Munich player will come to an end in the summer. It’s been an incredible journey, shaped by unique experiences, great encounters and unforgettable triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel immense gratitude and joy that I got to make this career with my beloved club. The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain. What I want as a farewell should be clear: titles we can celebrate together, and moments we’ll remember fondly for a long time.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th on his Red Bull debut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out," said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Good but not enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifying was suspended for about eight minutes in Q2 when a small trackside fire broke out as sparks from the cars ignited the grass in the dry conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fifth such incident of the weekend, with the second and third practice sessions also disrupted by fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain has been forecast for Sunday's race. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 NHL career goals on Friday, matching a mark that once seemed unassailable.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special," Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. "(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot," Ovechkin said. "Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys," he said with a nod to fans, "my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky," Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. "It hit the post and went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's buzzing right now," he said. "Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin's next chance to break the mark will come Sunday, when the Capitals play at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did break another record Friday, his 136th game-winning goal breaking the record he shared with Jaromir Jagr. (AFP)

    Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won both last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton," said the effervescent Pogacar. "Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace," Pogacar said. "He'll be in there on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for.
  <br>
  <br>
  First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is," said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne confirmed on Friday that he will leave the club at the end of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  De Bruyne, 33, has won 14 major trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here – and you deserve to hear it from me first," De Bruyne said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football led me to all of you - and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This City. This club. These people... gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what – we won everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian international has been instrumental in City's rise to the dominant force in English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was twice crowned players' player of the year in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 and is second in the Premier League's all-time standings for assists on 118.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract is due to expire at the end of June, but it remains unclear whether he will continue to see out his days as a City player at the Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 until July 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every story comes to an end, but this has definitely been the best chapter," De Bruyne added. "Let's enjoy these last moments together!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the National Games test events – the Hong Kong International Track Cup – will be held from April 19 to 21, attracting professional cyclists from around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event will be held at the Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O, involving about 150 cyclists from over ten countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the organising committee, Steve Nip, said it is also the first time that 50 cyclists from local affiliated clubs will be invited to participate in elite and junior races.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Audiences can enjoy races involving world-class cyclists, and also cheer for cyclists from local affiliated clubs. I hope they can achieve good results with the advantage of racing at their home track," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, the vice president of the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China, also expressed hope for local cyclists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides the opportunity for the Hong Kong team and young cyclists from local affiliated clubs to showcase their skills," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public can also watch races of a high standard, and they can treat this as a warm-up for the National Games at the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR cyclist Ceci Lee, who will participate in the race, said she will step up training in the coming two weeks, especially on her sprinting skills, and she hopes she can achieve good results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local cyclist, Mow Ching-yin expects his condition to improve gradually as it is getting closer to the National Games, and he said he will focus on improving his endurance and speed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard tickets for the Track Cup can be had for HK$50, while a concession ticket costs HK$30.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting "you don't know what you're doing" at the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants.
  <br>
  <br>
  For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot. (AFP)

 The United States is the sole bidder for the 2031 Women's World Cup, and the United Kingdom is set to host the 2035 tournament, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Uefa Congress in Belgrade, Infantino said the only bid for 2031 was "from the USA and potentially some other Concacaf members together, and 2035 is from Europe, from the home nations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino also said Fifa planned to increase the number of participating teams at the Women's World Cup from 32 teams to 48 in time for the 2031 tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's announcement comes after the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed last month that they would submit an expression of interest in staging the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  World football's governing body last month said it would only welcome bids for 2035 from Europe or Africa, saying that the identity of the hosts would be confirmed at a Fifa Congress in the second quarter of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States – who are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada the 2026 men's World Cup – also confirmed in early March that it would push ahead with a bid for 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Morocco had also been in the running with African nations invited to bid too, but Infantino's comments suggest they are now out of the running.
