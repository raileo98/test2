<div class="itemFullText">
 Team Hong Kong, China put up a strong fight but fell short against Jiangsu, as they missed out on gold at a men's handball tournament at Kai Tak Arena.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day tournament, featuring Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau, and Hong Kong, wrapped up on Sunday. It also served as a test event for the National Games in November, when the city will host handball and seven other competition events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite raucous support from the home crowd, the SAR found themselves on the back foot against the onslaught of Jiangsu players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides traded goals early on, but the visitors took a 15-9 lead at the half.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, Team Hong Kong, China ramped up their offensive play, closing the gap to just three at one point. However, their rally fizzled out as Jiangsu came away 28-20 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the earlier bronze medal match, Guangdong dominated Macau, China wire to wire. Guangdong jumped to a 20-10 lead at halftime, and pulled away for a final score of 42-20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung, the head of Hong Kong's National Games Coordination Office, said more than 2,800 spectators attended the matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  He revealed revealed another test event has been scheduled next weekend -- the triathlon at the Central waterfront.

    Romantic Warrior claims second in close Saudi Cup race

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior has come up just short in winning the world's most lucrative race, galloping to second in an epic finish against Japan's Forever Young in the US$20 million Saudi Cup in Riyadh.
 <br>
  <br>
  Romantic Warrior – the highest-earning racehorse of all time – turned up at the Saudi capital for the race in the early hours of Sunday, Hong Kong time, hoping to add to the US$23 million already in the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-year-old horse led the pack until the final 50 metres of the race, when the Japanese dirt star rallied to surge ahead in a nail-biting finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  This marked the first loss for Romantic Warrior since the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Hong Kong-trained horse collected US$3.5 million for finishing second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was gallant in defeat. We had a great pitch in behind and he got a little bit of kickback, so I thought I'll get him into clear air and he made ground just beautifully. He went through his paces really nicely all the way to the line and I can safely say I wasn't stopping. I did not alter my stride pace at all," said superstar jockey James McDonald.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, I'm gutted he got beaten ... but he went down on his sword that's for sure and made one hell of a race out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trainer Danny Shum, for his part, called the performance "a good run", noting Romantic Warrior was only beaten by a head.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all did our best. I hope to win every time, but racing is racing. As long as he tries his best and it's a really good race – I think most of the people enjoyed the race," said Shum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The champion galloper is set to next tackle the 1,800-metre Group One Dubai Turf in April.

<img alt="Luka Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792827_1_20250223135007.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic delivered a dominant 32-point performance as the Los Angeles Lakers snapped the Denver Nuggets' nine-game winning streak on Saturday with an impressive 123-100 victory on the road in Colorado.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, playing only his fourth game for the Lakers since his blockbuster trade from Dallas, was in scintillating form as the Lakers conjured a statement wire-to-wire win over their Western Conference rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Slovenian superstar was the standout performer on a night when the Lakers saw four players finish with 20 points or more for the first time this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished with 32 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists while LeBron James backed him with 25 points. Austin Reaves added 23 points and Rui Hachimura 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm starting to feel a little bit more like myself, that's why I was smiling the whole game," Doncic said afterward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's still a lot of room for improvement and this is only my fourth game. Chemistry takes time. But you saw today that things are getting better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic had signalled he was in the mood for a stellar performance early in the first quarter, arrowing a couple of superb passes to James and Jaxson Hayes to help the Lakers take an 8-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sublime three-pointer from Doncic put the Lakers into a 31-18 lead as the visitors remained firmly on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic finished the first quarter with 16 points, four rebounds and three assists and was soon back into the groove in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A delicate lobbed assist to James for an alley-oop dunk made it 60-52 before Doncic unfurled a 24-foot three-pointer to put the Lakers 11 points up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets closed the deficit to 63-54 at the half, but the Lakers remained in control for much of the third quarter, taking a nine-point advantage into the final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over in the fourth, and Doncic put Los Angeles into a 20-point lead at 117-97 with just over four minutes remaining after another Denver turnover to effectively ice the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 34-21 with the win and remain fifth in the West. The Nuggets fell to 37-20 with the defeat. (AFP)

<img alt="The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792765_1_20250222180132.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Athletes participating in a handball test event for the National Games on Saturday said they were happy with the atmosphere and facilities at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men's handball test event is underway at the Kai Tak Arena over Saturday and Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The competing teams are Guangdong, Jiangsu, Macau and Hong Kong, China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang Quan, a handballer from the Jiangsu team, said the arena is comparable to those in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think this venue is very professional. Since I have played in Europe before, I find that the lighting and flooring here are very similar to those in Europe - basically the same level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong men's handball team captain Freddie Tse said the venue arrangements were first-class, rating them 9 out of 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very excited and amazed. It's my first time at Hong Kong's home court, and it's rare to hear our own language. You can see that the spectators are our family and friends. Even the people around us – it feels so familiar," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huang Peijie from the Guangdong handball team, meanwhile, said the atmosphere was excellent and players were eager to compete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some spectators told RTHK they were there to support the SAR team and looked forward to watching the actual Games in person.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I play handball myself, that's why I follow this sport closely. I hope more people will get to know this sport. I want to see the Hong Kong team's techniques and learn a move or two," said a spectator.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the match between Jiangsu and Guangdong, Jiangsu led by four points at half-time and managed to secure a spot in the final with a 29-23 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong team, meanwhile, also made the final after beating Macau 33-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final between Jiangsu and Hong Kong will be staged at the Kai Tak Arena on Sunday afternoon.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers boosted their NBA-best record with a 142-105 romp past the New York Knicks on Friday, tightening their grip on the Eastern Conference lead with an all-around dominant display.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points to lead six Cavs players to score in double figures, connecting on five of seven three-pointers as Cleveland drilled 19 from beyond the arc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland out-scored the Knicks 66-38 in the paint and held a 23-6 edge in fast-break points, pushing their lead to as many as 42 on the way to a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Evan Mobley added 21 points and Jarrett Allen scored 10 before departing in the third quarter with a right hand injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland guard Darius Garland took a hard fall in the first half, striking his head on the court, but stayed in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 16 of his 26 points in the first quarter for the Knicks but was held scoreless in the second period as the Cavs roared to a 77-50 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns scored 23 points for New York, who are in third place in the East but fell to 0-6 this season against the three teams with the league's best records: Cleveland, Boston and Oklahoma City.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the biggest thing was just try to set the tone early," Mitchell said, adding that the determination to dominate had nothing to do with the Knicks' first-round playoff win over the Cavs two seasons ago and everything to do with the fact that they could yet meet in this post-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For us, it's about how do we continue to build and get better," Mitchell said. "So we're trying to measure ourselves, continue to do what we've been doing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City, stunned by a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves heading into the All-Star break last week, rebounded with a 130-107 victory over the Utah Jazz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 21 points to lead six Thunder players in double figures. He added eight assists, two rebounds, three blocked shots and a steal in the wire-to-wire win.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Orlando, where Memphis star Ja Morant drove for a layup that tied it at 104-104 with 1:50 remaining and Desmond Bane delivered the decisive free-throw in the Grizzlies' 105-104 victory over the Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morant scored 23 points while Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr added 16 apiece for the Grizzlies, with Jackson blocking a potential game-winner by Orlando's Paolo Banchero at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Jalen Green scored 35 points and Alperen Sengun added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Rockets in a 121-115 victory over Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 37 points for the Timberwolves, but was held to just three in the fourth quarter as the Rockets, who led by as many as 14 in the first quarter, clamped down defensively to win a game that featured 20 lead changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Kuzma, acquired by Milwaukee from the Wizards earlier this month, scored 19 points to lead the Bucks to a 104-101 victory over his former team in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, limited by foul trouble, scored 18 points before fouling out with 3:37 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khris Middleton, who arrived in Washington in the four-team deal that sent Kuzma to Milwaukee, scored 12 points against his former team in his Wizards debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton's three-pointer with 1:01 remaining pulled the Wizards within 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Brook Lopez made a pair of free-throws and blocked a Middleton layup, and Middleton came up empty on a last-gasp three-point attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dallas Mavericks, fuelled by 35 points from Kyrie Irving, beat the New Orleans Pelicans 111-103 for a third straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit's Cade Cunningham scored 25 points and handed out 12 assists as the Pistons notched a fifth straight win, 125-110 over the San Antonio Spurs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool will take on Paris Saint-Germain in one of the standout ties in the last 16 of this season's Champions League after the teams were paired together in Friday's draw.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool finished first in the 36-team league phase of the competition to qualify directly for this stage, while PSG had to come through a two-legged play-off tie in which they crushed fellow French side Brest 10-0 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first leg will take place at the Parc des Princes in Paris on March 4 or 5, with the return at Anfield a week later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs last met in the Champions League in the group stage in 2018/19, when PSG won 2-1 at home after Liverpool triumphed 3-2 in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another eye-catching tie, reigning champions Real Madrid will play city rivals Atletico Madrid in a repeat of the finals of 2014 and 2016, both of which were won by Los Blancos.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern Munich will take on German rivals Bayer Leverkusen, while Arsenal face PSV Eindhoven and Inter Milan take on Feyenoord, who are fresh from knocking out AC Milan in the play-offs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona will face Benfica, who they defeated 5-4 away in Lisbon in the league phase last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa will face Club Brugge, having already lost away to the Belgians in the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund will take on French side Lille. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 In an ice hockey grudge match of border rivals fuelled by political tensions, "51st state" Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime on Thursday to win the Four Nations Face-Off final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Canada's Connor McDavid scored the title-winning goal off a pass from Mitch Marner to deliver Canada the victory after enduring political barbs from US President Donald Trump about being the "51st state."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can't take our country -- and you can't take our game," outgoing Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- dubbed "Governor Trudeau" by Trump -- posted on X moments after the triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory came in the hard-hitting rematch of a bruising round-robin clash Saturday between NHL stars that produced three fights in nine seconds in a 3-1 US triumph -- but Canada won when it mattered most.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just to see the reaction, knowing what it means to us," McDavid, named the player of the game, said when asked the best part about the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not an Olympic gold medal but it means the world to our group. Everybody battled so hard. It was special."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the fight for bragging rights ahead of next year's Winter Olympics in Italy, Canada goaltender Jordan Binnington made several great saves early in overtime and 33 in all.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tone for a gripping contest was set when microphone-wearing referee Gord Dwyer said, "Let's get ready for an epic battle," just before dropping the puck to start the game, which went off without any brawling.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sellout crowd at Boston's TD Garden produced an electric atmosphere for one of the most hotly anticipated hockey games for years, an emotionally charged spectacle intensified by recent political sparring between the two North American neighbours.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense," US winger Matthew Tkacuk said of the buzz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This feeling is unbelievable. As big a game as I've ever played in in my life."
  <br>
  <br>
  US leader Trump ratcheted up the anticipation in a pre-game call to the American squad and social media remarks repeating his desire for Canada to become the USA's "51st state." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paulo Dybala scored twice as Roma beat Porto to clinch a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, as Ajax clawed through in extra time despite playing a man down for 95 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spanish forward Samu Aghehowa gave Porto the lead against Roma after a 1-1 draw in Portugal last week, but two quick-fire goals from Dybala turned the tie in favour of the 2023 runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porto were reduced to 10 men when Canada midfielder Stephen Eustáquio was sent off early in the second half, and Niccolo Pisilli struck what proved to be the crucial third goal for Claudio Ranieri's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devyne Rensch turned into his own net deep into added time as Roma progressed 4-3 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having a champion like Dybala means a lot. He's extraordinary; he says very little, but he is a leader and always says the right things," Ranieri said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Roma will find out whether they play Athletic Bilbao or city rivals Lazio in the next round when the draw for the last 16 is conducted on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a huge opportunity in Europe. This competition can give us a lot this year," said Dybala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, four-time European champions Ajax survived a huge scare against close neighbours Union Saint-Gilloise of Belgium, nearly squandering a 2-0 advantage from a week ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Mac Allister's header halved the deficit and Promise David tucked away a penalty after Ajax captain Davy Klaassen was dismissed in the 25th minute for a deliberate handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kenneth Taylor's spot-kick in extra time was enough to put Ajax through 3-2 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  José Mourinho, a former winner of the competition with Porto and Manchester United, saw his Fenerbahce side go through 5-2 overall after a 2-2 draw away to Anderlecht in a match that was delayed in the first half by crowd trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt overturned a first leg deficit against Dutch side Twente with a dramatic 5-2 win after extra time in the Arctic Circle to progress 6-4 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts were heading out before striking twice in second-half stoppage time but Twente then levelled the tie and forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sondre Brunstad Fet put Bodo/Glimt back ahead in the 111th minute, with a second own goal of the night from Twente sealing qualification for their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, meanwhile, thrashed Midtjylland 7-3 on aggregate after a 5-2 win in San Sebastian. The Spaniards will take on United or Tottenham in the last 16. (AFP)

    Alcaraz knocked out by Lehecka in Qatar Open quarters

<img alt="The world number three Alcaraz was dealt his second loss of the year in the quarter-final upset. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792554_1_20250221073828.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number three Carlos Alcaraz was sent crashing out of the Qatar Open in the quarter-finals after losing to Jiri Lehecka, as the Spaniard headed for the exit along with second seed Alex de Minaur.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alcaraz dropped the first set before recovering to level, and then led by a break in the decider, but world number 25 Lehecka won the final four games for a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz entered the clash on a seven-match winning streak following his triumph in Rotterdam earlier this month but ran into trouble against a confident Lehecka, who won his second career title in Brisbane to start the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, I don't know what I could have done better," said Alcaraz. "I have to give credit to him as well, because when he was down, especially in the third set, he didn't give up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was returning pretty well, really aggressively, no mistakes, or almost no mistakes," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Lehecka will play British eighth seed Jack Draper on Friday for a place in the final. The Czech is through to the last four in Doha for the second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel great," said Lehecka. "To win a match like that against a player like this is a super big achievement. I believed in myself and knew I had the level to produce this kind of tennis. I think the most important part was I believed in my game and did not back down."
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper battled back to beat Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the last of the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini, a former world number six and Wimbledon runner-up, had knocked out Novak Djokovic in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrey Rublev converted his eighth match point against De Minaur to take his place in the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian, a Qatar winner in 2020, had to dig deep to down the Australian 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (10/8).
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded Rublev let slip a 5-2 lead in the final set as De Minaur scrambled back into contention to force a tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev finally got over the line, the 27-year-old saving a match point himself in a memorable quarter-final clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I had my first match point, I played really well," said Rublev. "I did everything amazing and he just played an unreal rally. He made the backhand down the line and I played a good volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then he makes a forehand pass down the line. In most of the matches, normally after these points, they win – it's a turning point," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I then started to get a bit more tight and more emotional, I was a bit unlucky," he went on to say. Then when I lost my serve, I said 'Okay, whatever, if I'm gonna lose, at least just try to do your best until the end'."
  <br>
  <br>
  This was his first win against a top-10 player since August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rublev's reward for his fourth semi-final appearance in Qatar is a meeting with Felix Auger-Aliassime.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian was leading his quarter-final against Daniil Medvedev 6-3 when the Russian had to retire. (AFP)

    Wembanyama to miss rest of NBA regular season
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="The injury comes after Wembanyama made his first All-Star appearance this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792542_1_20250221053538.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama is expected to miss the rest of the NBA season after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, the team announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs said in a statement that the 21-year-old French player was diagnosed with the blood clot after he returned to San Antonio following last Sunday's All-Star game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wembanyama is expected to miss the remainder of the 2024-25 regular season," the Spurs said. "The team will provide updates as appropriate."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement brings a premature end to another outstanding campaign by Wembanyama, who earned Rookie of the Year honours last season after being taken first overall in the NBA draft.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's tough," San Antonio's veteran point guard Chris Paul said of losing Wembanyama, who was averaging 24.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.7 assists and a league-best 3.8 blocks in 46 games for the Spurs this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough more than anything, I think for all of us, knowing how much he means to our team, but more so knowing how much he means to the game and how much he loves to play," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other NBA players have dealt with similar health concerns. Chris Bosh, a two-time NBA champion with the Miami heat, was ultimately forced to retire at the age of 32 after repeatedly dealing with blood clots.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Detroit Pistons' Ausar Thompson has returned to play 33 games this season afer he was diagnosed with a blood clot in March of last year. Brandon Ingram, now with the Toronto Raptors, recovered after being diagnosed with a blood clot in his right arm in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it's a big blow for a player who made an immediate impact on arriving in the league and whose influence is only growing in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama became an All-Star for the first time when he was chosen as a reserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Young Minnesota star Anthony Edwards noted Wembanyama's rise during All-Star weekend when he was asked if he considered himself a candidate for "next face of the league".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not really," Edwards said, "That's what they've got Wemby for."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs have reportedly indicated they expect Wembanyama to make a full recovery.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the team's announcement didn't rule out the possibility that Wembanyama could be fit for the playoffs, the chances of San Antonio reaching the post-season without him look slim.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs are in 12th place in the Western Conference, two spots away from the final play-in berth now held by the Golden State Warriors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even with the arrival of high-scoring guard De'Aaron Fox from Sacramento at the trade deadline, the Spurs will likely suffer without their centrepiece. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's High Court has found former soccer federation boss Luis Rubiales guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and fined him over 10,000 euros (US$10,434), the court said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It acquitted him of charges of coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence for Rubiales, 47, in a case that caused heated debate in Spain about sexism in women's football and wider Spanish society.
  <br>
  <br>
  The court said in a statement it had also acquitted Rubiales' three co-defendants who were accused of attempting to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss, at the 2023 World Cup awards ceremony in Sydney, was consensual.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ensuing furore overshadowed Spain's victory in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales has maintained through this month's trial that Hermoso had consented to be kissed amid the celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200-metre radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fine was set at 20 euros a day over an 18-month period. (Reuters)

    Handball National Games trials to be held this weekend

<img alt="Yeung Tak-keung said a series of trials for the National Games will take place in Hong Kong in the coming months. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792464_1_20250220161403.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong official who heads an office coordinating the upcoming National Games, Yeung Tak-keung, said he expects around 1,000 spectators to attend a handball tournament serving as a test event for the Games this weekend.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two-day event will take place at the Kai Tak Arena, and comes before the SAR hosts the nationwide sporting tournament with Guangdong and Macau for the first time this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung, who's the former sports commissioner, said on Thursday that workers at the Sports Park are ready after a series of trials in recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said officials were making final adjustments for the tournament this weekend, such as making sure the changing rooms are fine as well as the lighting for the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because for handball, sometimes players need to lob the ball high when they go on a fast break. That means they will look up, so we have to adjust the angle of the lights, and how bright they are," Yeung told RTHK in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in late March would also be a test event for the National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But while it is the first time the mega event would take place at Kai Tak, Yeung doesn't expect much of a problem because the SAR has a wealth of experience in hosting it.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the test event for beach volleyball would be held around Easter on the football pitches at Victoria Park, and stalls would be set up nearby to promote Hong Kong culture to spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  But before that, Yeung said officials want to bring something different for the two-day triathlon trial races starting from March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the past, such events would take place along the harbourfront. But this time, besides having the cycling and running there, a segment of the track will be inside the space for events at the Central Harbourfront," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will also be stands for the spectators, and other areas for them, so they can be more comfortable, and get a close-up view of the athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung said officials would also put up a giant screen in Central for a better viewing experience.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé struck a brilliant hat-trick for Champions League holders Real Madrid in a 3-1 win over Manchester City, helping Los Blancos reach the last 16 with a 6-3 aggregate victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side, shorn of key striker Erling Haaland, suffered a painful early exit without laying a glove on the completely dominant 15-time record winners in the Spanish capital, until Nico González tapped home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  French superstar Mbappé broke the deadlock with a lob in the fourth minute and netted a fine second after combining with his attacking partners as the English side were sliced open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker, in sensational form after a slow start to life at Madrid, completed his treble in the second half with a low strike from the edge of the box to reach seven goals in the competition this season in 10 appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We wanted to win and go through because for us it was logical that Real Madrid would be in the last 16 of the Champions League," Mbappé said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has scored 28 goals this season, with 18 in his last 18 games across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I said it before, I didn't come to Real Madrid to play badly," continued Mbappé. "Making my dream come true is one thing, but I want to play well here – mark an era and make history at Real Madrid."
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who won the competition in 2023, were a far cry from their best as has been the case for much of their campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The best team won, they deserve to be there and we don't," admitted Guardiola. "We had a bad year in the competition – when you finish 22nd in the group, it's because we haven't been good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been our worst year," he added. "We've been an incredible team and this year, for many reasons, we have lost that consistency."
  <br>
  <br>
  City were dealt bad news before the game with Haaland, who netted twice in the first leg, named on the bench after a suffering a knock at the weekend against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side performed almost flawlessly from the off and took the lead in the opening stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé shrugged off Ruben Dias and lofted the ball over City goalkeeper Ederson after young centre-back Raul Asencio played him in with a long pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy when you concede such an early goal," said Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  John Stones limped off for the visitors a few minutes later in another blow for the Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé netted his second in the 33rd minute after Madrid's "fantastic four" star players combined. Jude Bellingham fed Vinicius who rolled the ball across for Rodrygo, who nudged it to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Paris Saint-Germain forward slipped inside to leave the flailing Josko Gvardiol sliding in the wrong direction and drilled home at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola had claimed City only had "one percent chance" of beating Madrid and his team played like they believed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's only blot on their copybook was a booking for Bellingham for fouling England team-mate Phil Foden, leaving him suspended for the last 16 first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham, who caused a stir after being sent off for dissent last weekend in La Liga, was assured in midfield but the night belonged to Mbappé.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old completed his hat-trick just after the hour mark, opening up some space on the edge of the box and firing beyond Ederson as City's defence stood off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé departed to a standing ovation and Madrid fans marvelled at the ease of their team's victory, against an opponent with whom they have shared many close battles in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors pulled a goal back in stoppage time when Omar Marmoush crashed a free-kick against the crossbar and González rolled home the rebound, but it offered scant consolation.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost 13 games in their last 26 across all competitions, and face Premier League leaders Liverpool next on Sunday, with a battle to finish in the top four on their hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Madrid the last 16 is a clash with either city rivals Atletico or German champions Bayer Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a complete game in attack, defence, possession and transition," said a satisfied Ancelotti. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League title charge was slowed by Aston Villa after a pulsating 2-2 draw left neither side satisfied.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's men open up an eight-point lead at the top of the table over second-placed Arsenal, but the Gunners now have a game in hand over the Reds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool led through Mohamed Salah but were also forced to come from behind after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins swung momentum in Villa's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected shot secured a point for the visitors, but it should have been more as substitute Darwin Núñez missed a glorious chance to snatch victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down," said Slot on Núñez's late miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you watch the game back we created far more chances than them, we did everything we needed to do. The only thing that wasn't perfect was conceding from a set-piece."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, could also have won it in stoppage time as Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen went close.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A draw I think is fair for both teams because they had also chances to score," said Villa boss Unai Emery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are now 22 Premier League games unbeaten, but a second 2-2 draw in eight days offers Arsenal hope in the title race, especially as Slot's side visit Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're happy where we are," added Slot. "A bit too much now we played games where we deserve more than we got. "We want to achieve something together this season and we have all the ingredients for it but still 12 games to go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were handed their first Villa starts by Unai Emery as he reacted to a disappointing 1-1 draw against 10-man Ipswich on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford nearly had a hand in the opening goal but had strayed offside before his cross was turned into his own net by Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were masters of their own downfall when the opener did arrive on 29 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andres Garcia's backpass went straight to Diogo Jota, who unselfishly squared for Salah to fire in his 29th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa were level within nine minutes as Liverpool failed to properly clear a free-kick into the box and the ball fell kindly to Tielemans, who produced a classy finish on the volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota should have restored the visitors' advantage immediately when be blazed high and wide with just Emi Martínez to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead it was Villa who led at half-time as poor Liverpool defending allowed Watkins a free run to meet Lucas Digne's cross with a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford's one big chance to make his mark for his new club arrived just seconds into the second half when he skipped past the onrushing Alisson Becker, but could not beat Ibrahima Konate's towering presence as the French defender headed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Liverpool onslaught duly followed to extend Slot's run of never having lost an away Premier League game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jota curled a fine effort from the edge of the box off the bar. Alexander-Arnold was a growing influence on the game when he levelled on the hour mark with the aid of a deflection off Tyrone Mings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot threw on Luis Díaz and Núñez off the bench in search of a winner and one of his substitutes should have delivered a vital three points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Núñez had an open goal to aim at after being picked out by Dominik Szoboszlai but fired over to the disbelief of his manager. Martínez then had to rush off his line to deny Nunez another clear run on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, though, had the majority of the chances in a frantic finale. Jacob Ramsey's strike was ruled out for offside before Rogers and Malen's powerful drives flew just off target. (AFP)

    Man Utd spent £14.5mn on sackings including Ten Hag

<img alt="United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792358_1_20250219221926.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United paid a total of £14.5 million (US$18.3 million) to sack manager Erik ten Hag, sporting director Dan Ashworth and other members of their football staff, according to the fallen English giants' latest accounts published on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  United, the 20-time champions of England, are currently a lowly 15th in the Premier League table following Sunday's 1-0 loss at Tottenham, with only West Ham and Wolves between them and the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hope for a 'bounce' in results under new manager Ruben Amorim has failed to materialise since the Portuguese boss replaced Ten Hag, who was sacked in October just 116 days after United triggered a clause to extend the Dutchman's contract until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  A costly decision taken by minority owner Jim Ratcliffe's INEOS group was compounded by the rapid exit from Old Trafford of Ashworth, who arrived from Newcastle on July 1 following lengthy talks only to leave on December 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial expense of those decisions was laid bare in United's results for the quarter ending December 31 under 'exceptional items'.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exceptional items for the quarter were a cost of £14.5 million," said a United press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This relates to costs associated with the departure of former men's first team manager Erik ten Hag and various members of football staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  United confirmed in their first quarter results that the pay-off to Ten Hag and his staff was worth £10.4 million, indicating Ashworth's departure cost some £4.1 million. (AFP)

    WTA to ban man after Raducanu 'security incident'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Emma Raducanu was targeted by "a man who exhibited fixated behaviour" during the WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai, tennis officials said on Wednesday, after the former US Open champion was reduced to tears on court.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old Briton was down 2-0 in the first set against Karolina Muchova on Tuesday when she approached the umpire, then briefly took refuge behind the umpire's chair.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muchova went over to see what was wrong before the 2021 New York champion Raducanu reappeared, wiping away tears with her towel.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Women's Tennis Association said it would ban the man after what it called "the security incident in Dubai."
  <br>
  <br>
  "On Monday, February 17, Emma Raducanu was approached in a public area by a man who exhibited fixated behaviour," a statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This same individual was identified in the first few rows during Emma's match on Tuesday at the Dubai Duty-Free Tennis Championships and subsequently ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will be banned from all WTA events pending a threat assessment."
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, a London court issued a five-year restraining order against a man who stalked the British tennis star, including making several visits to her home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA said in its statement that it "is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech Republic's Muchova won the second-round match 7-6 (8/6), 6-4. (AFP)

    Bayern score late, see off Celtic in Champions League

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 94th minute strike by Alphonso Davies to secure a 1-1 draw on the night and a 3-2 aggregate win.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern will face either their fellow German rivals Bayer Leverkusen or Spanish giants Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic had led 1-0 since the 63rd minute and the Scottish side had been on the verge of taking the German giants to extra time and pulling off their first ever win in Germany.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with Harry Kane off injured and time running out, Davies stepped up as Bayern's saviour, tapping in after Celtic keeper Kasper Schmeichel had kept out Leon Goretzka's header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern went into this game 2-1 up from last week's first leg at Celtic Park and seeking to stretch their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated possession in the first half but Celtic were more dangerous with at least three clear cut chances to score before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Bayern Munich second-team player, Nicolas Kuehn beat Manuel Neuer but Raphael Guerreiro cleared off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later, Alistair Johnston flashed a dangerous ball across the Bayern goal. With Neuer stranded the ball flew just beyond Daizen Maeda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then Maeda missed a golden opportunity to put Celtic ahead. When Dayot Upamecano was forced into a stray pass, Kuehn led the surge forward and fed Maeda, who blazed over with Kuehn and Jota in support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern dominated the ball on a freezing night but suffered with a lack of quality in attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serge Gnabry was wasteful while Kane sometimes cut an isolated figure, starved of service. The England captain's best chance saw him rattling the bar with a snapshot after Josip Stanisic picked him out from the right.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would be Kane's final action. The striker was withdrawn at half time, feeling the effects of an injury picked up against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern upped the pressure after the break and fashioned a clear chance when Goretzka went clean through. Schmeichel, however, made a crucial stop to keep Celtic in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after, Celtic were in front. Maeda seized on a loose pass by Josip Stanisic and helped it on toward Kuehn. Min-Jae Kim reached the ball first but could not clear and Kuehn was able to take a touch and find the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a goal that shocked the Allianz Arena and threatened Bayern's record of 20 European home games unbeaten. Celtic were delivering on coach Brendan Rodgers' pre-match battle cry to show bravery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern sought an equaliser but Vincent Kompany's side were reduced to long-range shots, with Schmeichel pulling off saves from Joshua Kimmich, Michael Olise and substitute Leroy Sane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic were moments away from inflicting Bayern's first defeat by a Scottish team and taking the tie into extra-time but the game had a sting in the tail. Olise delivered a pinpoint cross that was met by Goretzka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Schmeichel saved but Davies scrambled the rebound home off his shin to send Bayern through to the last 16. (AFP)

    Berrettini ends Djokovic comeback at Qatar Open

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic's comeback came to a crashing halt as he lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 to Matteo Berrettini in the second round of the Qatar Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who was seeded third and received a first-round bye, was playing his first match since limping out of his Australian Open semi-final in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb said that while he was not 100 per cent, fitness was not the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was outplayed by just a better player today," he said. "Yes, I wasn't at my desired level, and it could be that I'm still not moving the way I want to move, but I played without pain, so there is no excuse in that."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think he played a masterclass match to be honest, tactically, and served very well, so just a very deserved win from his side," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Berrettini's second win this year, and his first over a player in the top 10 since 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the Italian's first ever win over Djokovic. Their previous encounters included victories for the Serb in the Wimbledon final and Roland Garros quarterfinals, both in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Something I've been looking to do for a long time. I've played against him in the most important tournaments on tour," the 28-year-old Italian said on court after the victory. "I wish I could have won one of those matches."
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini has struggled with injuries over the last 18 months but won three tournaments after returning to court last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really happy with my performance," he said. "Really happy because I enjoyed my time out there, which is the most important thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  The first set went with serve but Berrettini took two points off Djokovic's serve to win the tiebreak. The Italian then broke to love in the second game of the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic had broken Berrettini 27 times in their four previous encounters but the Italian was comfortable on serve until the final game before finally winning on his second match point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A champion like Novak is always ready to come back," Berrettini said. "You don't have to think about match point. You have to think about the next point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic said that Andy Murray had agreed to continue as his coach "indefinitely" but said that he did not plan to overhaul his style.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am trying to improve my game, like everybody else. But my game is not going to change now drastically," Djokovic said. "My game is what it is, the core is going to be the same."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are more injuries. Things are not the same as 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I still try to take care of my body on a daily basis, and it's more challenging now, no doubt. I still try to do my very best, given the circumstances."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex de Minaur celebrated his birthday by beating Russian Roman Safiullin 6-1, 7-5, even though the Australian did not enjoy the weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They're tough days, these ones," said De Minaur. "It's cold, it's windy, you probably don't want to get out of bed. But once you step on court, you have to do everything you can to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's ugly or pretty tennis, you just put the ball in the court, and that's what I did today," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, world number six Daniil Medvedev eliminated compatriot and defending champion Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev has not won a tournament since the Rome Masters in spring 2023. He was knocked out in the second round of this year's Australian Open by teenage American Learner Tien.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third Russian former champion, Andrey Rublev, the fifth seed, beat Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker legends Judd Trump and Ronnie O'Sullivan said they are very excited to play in their first tournament in Hong Kong since becoming SAR residents.
 <br>
  <br>
  The World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 will be held in the Kai Tak Arena on March 8 and 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number one Trump is set to face Gary Wilson of England, while O'Sullivan will take on Si Jiahui from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Trump and O'Sullivan obtained their Hong Kong residency through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, it is more motivating to come back here because I feel like now that I'm here, and I feel like the people in Hong Kong can really get behind me and have someone to really support," Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think when you have somebody that is trying to represent Hong Kong, which I am now. I think the people can kind of see that. I hope that comes off in the way that I'm able to carry myself and give everybody full respect. I hope to make Hong Kong proud and be the first winner of this tournament."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan, a seven-time World champion, said he is ready and looks forward to play in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said efforts are underway to make sure the event is being held successfully at the brand new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also hope the spectators will understand if something don't go right on the first day, we guarantee that we will try to our best to fix problems to make sure the tournament will run smoothly."
  <br>
  <br>
  Exhibition matches will also take place during the two-day event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's top player, Marco Fu, will face off the legendary "Whirlwind" Jimmy White on March 8.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's Ng On-yee, meanwhile, takes on world number 1 Mink Nutcharut from Thailand the following day.

    Djokovic calls for revamp of tennis anti-doping system

<img alt="Djokovic speaks to reporters ahead of the ATP Qatar ExxonMobil Open 2025 men's tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792046_1_20250218080329.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic has urged tennis authorities to overhaul the sport's anti-doping system, pointing to "inconsistencies" in cases involving top stars Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek and those of lower-ranked players.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number one Sinner agreed to a three-month ban on Saturday, admitting "partial responsibility" for mistakes by his team which led to him twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner was facing a potential ban of two years after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against his initial exoneration by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA), announced in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a surprising move, WADA withdrew its appeal and came to an agreement with Sinner to accept a three-month ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-profile case last year, five-time Grand Slam champion Swiatek accepted a one-month ban after testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a majority of the players that I've talked to in the locker room, not just in the last few days, but also last few months, that are not happy with the way this whole process has been handled," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair. A majority of the players feel like there is favouritism happening. It seems like, it appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, the recently retired Simona Halep, a former world number one, was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA in 2022 after testing positive for the blood-boosting drug roxadustat.
  <br>
  <br>
  She argued it was the result of a tainted supplement and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which reduced her suspension to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Simona Halep and Tara Moore and some other players that are maybe less known that have been struggling to resolve their cases for years, or have gotten the ban for years," said Djokovic. "There is so much inconsistencies between the cases."
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who is returning to action this week at the Qatar Open for the first time since retiring injured from last month's Australian Open semi-finals, believes a change is needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now it's a ripe time for us to really address the system, because the system and the structure obviously doesn't work for anti-doping, it's obvious," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that in the next period of the near future that the governing bodies are going to come together, of our tours and the tennis ecosystem, and try to find a more effective way to deal with these processes," he added. "It's inconsistent, and it appears to be very unfair."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you are going to treat every case individually or independently, which is what's happening, then there's no consistency, then there is no transparency, and some cases are transparent, some are not," he continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The problem is that right now there is a lack of trust generally from the tennis players, both male and female, towards WADA and ITIA, and the whole process." (AFP)

    Team Shaq wins NBA All-Star revamp as James sits out

<img alt="Team Shaq’s OGs celebrate after winning the 2025 NBA All-Star match in San Francisco. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791953_1_20250217121940.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shaq's OGs won the first All-Star mini-tournament in NBA history, getting 15 points from Tatum and 12 from Stephen Curry to beat Chuck's Global Stars 41-25 in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was over early, as the Global Stars started the title game 0 for 10 from the field, 0 for 6 from 3-point range and fell into a quick 11-0 hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victor Wembanyama – the first-time All-Star who vowed that he would play hard, and did – led the Global Stars with 11 points in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the debut of the All-Star mini-tournament format – four teams, three games, with only 40 points needed to end each contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league went to the tournament format of untimed, short games with hopes that asking All-Stars to play fewer minutes would lead to better competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year’s game in Indianapolis had a 211-186 final score, setting a slew of records but prompting the league to take action after years of urging players to take the exhibition a bit more seriously.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two-shot foul of the night came early in the title game, with Nikola Jokic missing both shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Shaq's win came on the heels of Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James' annoucement of his withdrawal from the game prior to tip-off, citing a nagging ankle and foot injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You will not see anything from me tonight," James, 40, said. "Unfortunately I will not be in uniform tonight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still dealing with ankle and foot discomfort, so I will not be playing tonight, unfortunately," he added. "You know I hate that. But I'm looking forward to seeing the format." (AP/AFP)

    18-year-old Fonseca captures Argentina Open crown

<img alt="Brazil's Joao Fonseca celebrates with the trophy after winning the ATP 250 Argentina Open. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791911_1_20250217070810.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca became the 10th youngest champion in ATP Tour history when he swept past home hope Francisco Cerundolo in the final of the Argentina Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old, ranked 99 in the world and playing in his first tour-level final, came through 6-4, 7-6 (7/1) against his 28th-ranked opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca twice unsuccessfully served for the match but regrouped to claim victory in the tie-break in a frenzied atmosphere in Buenos Aires.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2024 ATP NextGen champion is the youngest male player from South America to win a tour title while his victory will also see him rise to 68 when the new rankings are released on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unbelievable week, even in Argentina there are some Brazilians cheering for me," Fonseca said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's just amazing. Every Brazilian, everyone from their country wants this support from your own country. For me, this moment that I'm living is just unbelievable," he added. "Of course I want to be number one, of course I want to win Slams, titles, but my dream is just to play tennis, and I'm living it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, seeking his fourth career title, was broken in the seventh game of the first set and fought off Fonseca when the teenager served for the trophy at 5-4 and 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Brazilian impressively held his nerve in the tie-break and celebrated his triumph by collapsing in joy on the dusty, clay surface.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca made his maiden final the hard way – in Friday's quarter-finals he saved two match points to defeat Mariano Navone in a match six minutes shy of three hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  In all, he defeated four Argentinian players on the road to the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had already announced himself on the scene in January when he came through qualifying at the Australian Open and defeated top 10 player Andrey Rublev in the first round. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Luis Díaz ended his goal drought to spark a tense 2-1 win against struggling Wolves.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side got back on track after an unexpectedly poor week thanks to Díaz's first goal in 2025 and yet another Mohamed Salah strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz opened the scoring early in the first half at Anfield as the Colombian forward finally scored for the 13th time this term after 10 games without a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Díaz has struggled to find the net, Salah is in red-hot form and his penalty before the interval took the Egypt star to 28 goals in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Cunha netted in the second half for fourth-bottom Wolves, but although Liverpool looked tired in a disjointed, nervous, climax, they held on for a valuable victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had gone two games without a win – an embarrassing FA Cup fourth round loss at second tier Plymouth last weekend and the stormy 2-2 draw at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's 2-0 win at Leicester on Saturday had applied a little more pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds responded to Arsenal's challenge as they moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, who last won the Premier League in 2020, will be within touching distance of the crown if they take maximum points from trips to Aston Villa and Manchester City before hosting Newcastle over the course of the next 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool boss Slot was in the dug-out despite being charged with abusive behaviour after angrily approaching referee Michael Oliver on the pitch following the Merseyside derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was furious that James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser was not disallowed because of a possible push by Toffees striker Beto on Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot had urged Liverpool to use their "anger" from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  They didn't have to wait long to light the fuse as Díaz bagged his first league goal at Anfield since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham won the battle of the Premier League's underachievers 1-0 to inflict another dismal result on Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison scored the only goal on 13 minutes as Spurs moved above United in the table into 12th thanks to a third win over the Red Devils this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory eased the pressure on under-fire Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou after exiting both domestic cup competitions this month to go with their lowly league position.
  <br>
  <br>
  United now find themselves down in 15th, but do enjoy a 12-point cushion over the bottom three.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me," said Amorim, who has won just four of 14 Premier League games since taking charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about," he added. "I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's first home league win since November came amid a spirit of revolt among their support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before kick-off and after the match Spurs fans again vented their frustration towards owners ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner read "24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy – time for change" as a sizeable contingent of the home crowd joined a protest calling for Levy to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the mood for Postecoglou was lifted even before kick-off as he was able to welcome back a host of first-team regulars who have been sidelined by injury. (AFP)

    Americans and Canadians in ice hockey punch fest

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded line-ups of the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing into US borders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came three fights in nine seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," USA coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred – I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not pre-arranged.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' - none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight in the mayhem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top NHL players from the USA and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the USA went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period. (AFP)

<img alt="A textbook header from Mikel Merino set the Gunners on their way. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791802_1_20250215223425.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal brushed off their shortage of specialist strikers on Saturday as midfielder Mikel Merino scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Leicester City that kept the north London club's Premier League title challenge on track.
 <br>
  <br>
  Merino's brace allowed second-placed Arsenal to cut Liverpool's advantage to four points although the leaders will be confident of replying against Wolverhampton Wanderers ,later on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Champions Manchester City's title hopes may have long since vanished but they looked much more recognisable as recent signing Omar Marmoush bagged a hat-trick in 13 first-half minutes in a 4-0 rout of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win allowed City to climb into fourth place with 44 points, three points behind Nottingham Forest whose top-four ambitions suffered a dent in a 2-1 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth's challenge for the top four shows no sign of petering out as they won 3-1 at bottom club Southampton to move above Chelsea and Newcastle into fifth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  When German forward Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season this week, joining Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Sako on the injured list, Arsenal fans must have feared the worst.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta gave Raheem Sterling a place in his starting line-up at Leicester but the former Chelsea man had a torrid afternoon and was replaced by Merino after 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard's impact was decisive as he broke the deadlock in the 81st minute from an assist by impressive teenager Ethan Nwaneri and he wrapped up the points in the 87th minute after good work by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the game started to suit (Merino) more because they started to defend much deeper, and we had more momentum, more sequences, more set-pieces as well in that period," Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told reporters. "We believed that he could impact the game. We were lucky that he did it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Arsenal stayed on Liverpool's heels, Leicester's plight is precarious. They are 19th with 17 points after losing nine of their last 10 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Egyptian Marmoush had not scored for City since his move from Eintracht Frankfurt last month but he opened his account in explosive fashion against Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Marmoush gave City the lead in the 19th minute with a lob after Newcastle defender Kieran Trippier misjudged goalkeeper Ederson's long delivery.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five minutes later he latched on to a pass from Ilkay Gundogan to fire home and then completed his hat-trick with a thumping shot after good work by Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew sooner or later he would score goals, he is a good finisher. Of course he has to improve, but now we see how he handles the compliments," manager Pep Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only blemish for City was Erling Haaland being forced off with an injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have not spoken to the doctor, but I was scared when he went down. Maybe it's not as bad as it could be," Guardiola said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood scored his 18th league goal of the season for Forest but it could not prevent his side slipping to defeat at Fulham for whom Emile Smith Rowe opened the scoring and Calvin Bassey headed the winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth moved to fifth with 43 points, just one behind Manchester City, as goals by Dango Ouattara, Ryan Christie and Marcus Tavernier sealed the points in the south coast derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation battlers Ipswich Town secured a well-earned point in a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa despite playing the entire second half with 10 men after Axel Tuanzebe was dismissed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich still went ahead after the break when Liam Delap steered in Omari Hutchinson's low cross but Ollie Watkins equalised for Villa who dropped to ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich are in 18th place with 17 points, two behind 17th placed Wolverhampton Wanderers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleventh-placed Brentford beat West Ham United 1-0 away thanks to an early goal by Kevin Schade. They have now won three successive away games in the top flight for the first time ever. (Reuters)

    Tennis world number one Sinner gets 3-month doping ban

<img alt="Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner says he accepts responsibility for his team's mistakes. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791789_1_20250215183106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month ban from tennis after the world number one admitted team mistakes led to him twice testing positive for traces of the banned substance clostebol in March last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The February 9 to May 4 suspension means Sinner will be free to play in the French Open, the second grand slam of the season, which begins on May 25 at Roland Garros.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Sinner said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) accepted that he "had no intent and did not derive any competitive advantage from the two positive tests."
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Open champion Sinner has always said that clostebol entered his system when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year," Sinner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realise Wada's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis, I have accepted Wada's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wada said separately that "Sinner did not intend to cheat" but that he would serve his suspension as he is responsible for the actions of his entourage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement between Sinner and Wada means that Sinner will be able to play in front of his home fans at the Rome Open which kicks off just after the end of his suspension and is the last big clay court tournament before Roland Garros. (AFP)

    Under-fire Guardiola mocks Liverpool

<img alt="Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola says Liverpool's point tally falls short of the champions' record. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791728_1_20250215090255.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola has taunted Premier League leaders Liverpool over their failure to match Manchester City's record 100-point tally.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's troubled side are trailing 16 points behind Liverpool after their bid for a fifth successive English crown collapsed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal as they chase a 20th title, which would equal Manchester United's record.
  <br>
  <br>
  But even if Arne Slot's men go on to secure the trophy, they now cannot match the record points total set when City won the first of Guardiola's six titles in 2017-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of City's faltering performance after Tuesday's 3-2 home defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off round first leg, Guardiola took a swipe at Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We took all the records in England. Who would do 100 points now in modern football? I'm waiting," Guardiola told reporters on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Or four in a row? I'm waiting - with clubs like Bournemouth, Fulham and Wolves that you have to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The standards, we dictated. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already - 99 but not 100."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Liverpool may not surpass fifth-placed City's record mark, Guardiola accepts his team have fallen behind their rivals this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I asked 'Gundo' (Ilkay Gundogan) yesterday, 'two years ago you were here, you were one year in Barcelona and you come back here, did you see changes in the Premier League?'," said Guardiola, whose team host top four rivals Newcastle on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He said massively, the difference was unbelievable. It's the truth. The teams are much, much, much better in all departments. People prepare so well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We cannot do it for the (injury) problems we've had. There are a lot of players, with the amount of minutes they have had, who are so tired, emotionally as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But guys, we deserve to have a bad season. We deserve not to be like we were. They are human beings, it can happen. We weren't consistent and we haven't had the players at their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the first time that me and many of the players have lived this position but we have to accept it (and recognise) what happened in the past was not normal."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola believes the difference from previous successful seasons is that City are no longer making the most of their dominance of possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I accept when the opponents have the ball, I'm going to suffer," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now we are suffering when we have the ball. It never happened before and, (right) now, I cannot change it. We are suffering because we are human beings." (AFP)

  <br>

 Hong Kong, China's men's curlers on Friday fell short of a podium finish at the Asian Winter Games, as the national team secured their 25th bronze and 83rd medal overall in Harbin.

 Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce won 3-0 at home to Anderlecht in the first leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off tie, while Real Sociedad triumphed 2-1 away to Midtjylland.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former Premier League duo Dusan Tadic and Edin Dzeko scored in the first half for Fenerbahce before Morocco international Youssef En-Nesyri headed in a third for the Turkish side to give them full control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mourinho won the competition with Porto in 2003 and again with Manchester United in 2017, also reaching the final when he was in charge of Roma two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad will return to Spain in a commanding position after a penalty from Brais Mendez and terrific goal by Japan winger Takefusa Kubo saw them past Danish Midtjylland, who pulled one back through Adam Buksa.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the tie will play United or Tottenham in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ajax took charge of their play-off against Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise with a 2-0 victory in Brussels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Christian Rasmussen steered the Dutch club ahead just before the hour, with 16-year-old Jorthy Mokio volleying in a second from 20 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Israel's Mohammad Abu Fani struck the only goal in Budapest as Ferencvaros won 1-0 against Viktoria Plzen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time former winners Porto host Roma later on Thursday, while Galatasaray are away to AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in the Conference League, Irish side Shamrock Rovers secured a 1-0 win away to Norwegians Molde.
  <br>
  <br>
  Molde defender Valdemar Lund was sent off before half-time for a challenge on Michael Noonan, who netted the winner in the second half to become the competition's youngest scorer at 16 years and 197 days old.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hope remains for the Hong Kong, China men's curling team, which is aiming to win the city's first ever medal at the Asian Winter Games, even after losing to South Korea in the semifinals on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad of Jason Chang, Martin Yan, Cheng Ching-nam, Chung Cheuk-hei and Ma Chi-lap were outmatched early in Harbin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to catch up, they lost 2-13 against the South Koreans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result sent them into a bronze medal match on Friday morning against the national team, which lost 6-7 to the Philippines in the other semifinal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR men's team beat Kazakhstan in the playoffs to win their spot in the final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong has sent a curling team to the Games, and the men's team has now become the sole hope for the SAR to secure a spot on the podium.

    Shenzhen Bay Port to close for cross-border marathon

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen Bay Port will be closed from 2am to 11am on February 23rd for a cross-border marathon event.
 <br>
  <br>
  At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on.
  <br>
  <br>
  “According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be no spectators for this event.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day.

<img alt="The SAR's men's team coach Carey Durant says the city will reach greater heights in international competition. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791470_2_20250213153829.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

    Bayern sink Celtic 2-1 in Champions League play-off

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kane was on target as Bayern Munich beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, while there were also wins for Benfica, Feyenoord and Club Brugge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are hoping to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their own Allianz Arena in Munich on May 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  They threatened to run riot against the Scottish champions at Celtic Park as they dominated the first half and took the lead just before the interval thanks to a superb Michael Olise strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's second goal came just four minutes after half-time, with the unmarked Kane scoring with a cushioned finish at the back post following a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Kane's seventh goal in this season's Champions League, and his 29th in 29 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Bundesliga leaders took their foot off the pedal after that, allowing Celtic – who had a first-minute Nicolas Kuehn goal disallowed for offside – to come back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brendan Rodgers' team pulled one back as Daizen Maeda scored following a corner with 11 minutes left, but they could not find an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's cliche to say, but it's the first half of the game. Overall, it's a really great result," said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany, according to the BBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic's first home defeat since December 2023 leaves them facing a huge task to try to turn the tie around in Germany next Tuesday, with the winners going through to face either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility," insisted Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Vangelis Pavlidis scored the only goal as Benfica won 1-0 away to Monaco, as the home side were forced to play much of the second half with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica had won 3-2 in Monaco in the league phase in November and they came out on top again at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Pavlidis strike just after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Greek international's sixth goal in his team's last five Champions League outings, a run which includes a hat-trick in the dramatic 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month. (AFP)

    Everton strike late to hold Liverpool in thriller

<img alt="Tarkowski struck late to salvage a 2-2 draw with Premier League-leaders Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791408_1_20250213060806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool in a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure, Curtis Jones and Slot were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Virgil van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since David Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton then suffered a huge blow as their creative hub Iliman Ndiaye limped off in tears after a long stoppage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first half never recovered its flow amid a flurry of fouls and yellow cards as the Premier League fixture with the most red cards in history threatened to boil over once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton started the better once more in the second period. Doucoure wasted a great chance to retake the lead when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home crowd briefly erupted once more when Branthwaite fired home only for the celebrations to be cut short by the offside flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was growing visibly frustrated with his side's lack of penetration going forward and turned to his bench for an impact with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jones and Darwin Núñez sent on to find a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes worked as Salah delivered what looked like a potential title-clinching moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Núñez exchanged a one-two and when the midfielder's shot was blocked by Branthwaite, it fell kindly for Salah to prod in his 27th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant save by Jordan Pickford crucially denied Salah a second late on. And Everton rallied when Liverpool failed to deal with a hopeful ball into the box and it fell to centre-back Tarkowski to fire into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy VAR check followed for offside and Everton fans had to be cleared off the pitch before the game could restart.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it did there was more fireworks as Doucoure and Jones were both shown a second yellow card for clashing after the Everton midfielder celebrated in front of the travelling Liverpool support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was also shown red for his protests towards referee Michael Oliver. (AFP)

    Arsenal's Havertz out for season with torn hamstring

<img alt="Havertz's injury is the latest blow to Arsenal's Premier League and European ambitions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791406_1_20250213060238.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's bid to win the Premier League could suffer a major setback following reports Kai Havertz is set to be ruled out for the remainder of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German forward sustained an injury during the club's warm-weather training camp in Dubai and was due to face further tests on the club's arrival back in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported on Wednesday the 25-year-old Havertz had suffered a torn hamstring and could now miss the rest of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, however, have yet to comment on the extent of Havertz's injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His potential long-term absence would though compound the problems confronting Gunners boss Mikel Arteta after Arsenal were unable to bolster their attack during the recent January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London club failed in an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz was set to lead Arsenal's line for the rest of the season, with Arteta even saying it was possible the Germany international would have to play every game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus is already out for the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month, whle Bukayo Saka has been absent since December, although there are hopes the England international could return next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, is also sidelined after he was forced off injured during Arsenal's League Cup semi-final second-leg semi-final defeat at Newcastle last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  All these absences leave the Gunners with only three recognised forward players in Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta may well speak about Havertz – who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances this season – on Friday when he holds a pre-match press conference to preview the Gunners' league game away to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are presently second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool but having played a game more, as they attempt to become champions of England for the first time in 21 years. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

<img alt="Jude Bellingham's late winner helped lift Real Madrid over Manchester City in the first leg of their play-off tie. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791253_2_20250212063303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jude Bellingham scored the winner in stoppage time as Real Madrid twice came from behind to inflict more misery on Manchester City with a 3-2 Champions League play-off, first leg win at the Etihad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland twice put City in front with his first goals in five games against Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the holders hit back through Kylian Mbappé and Brahim Díaz before Bellingham stroked home in the 92nd minute on his return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have a monumental task ahead to progress to the last 16 when the sides meet again in the Spanish capital on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs were meeting for the fourth consecutive season in the Champions League, with the winners in each of the previous three years going on to lift the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that familiarity did not breed enough contempt, Madrid's decision to boycott City midfielder Rodri's crowning as Ballon d'Or winner last year added extra animosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was rewarded for his role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and a fourth consecutive Premier League title.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Spanish giants took umbrage at Vinicius Junior being overlooked for the prize and pulled out all of their representatives from the ceremony in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner before kick-off showed Rodri with the Ballon d'Or trophy alongside the lyric "Stop crying your heart out" from City-supporting band Oasis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodri's absence since September with a season-ending knee injury has played a major role in City's decline this season as the English champions sit 15 points off the pace in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years Madrid have been pegged back on the ropes at the Etihad, twice conceding four times in three visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the visitors had a series of early chances to sow more doubt in City minds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius' every touch was booed and the home fans were delighted when he had a penalty ruled out for straying offside before he was wiped out by Ederson. The City goalkeeper then made a vital save from Mbappé and Nathan Ake deflected Ferland Mendy's shot wide with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men hit the visitors with a sucker punch on 19 minutes thanks to a brilliant team goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish's dinked cross was chested down by Josko Gvardiol into Haaland's path, who stayed millimetres onside before stroking home his 26th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real came roaring back as Vinicius' effort came back off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  City also hit the woodwork through Manuel Akanji and Thibaut Courtois was forced into a spectacular save from Phil Foden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland remained a constant threat to Madrid's injury-ravaged defence. Ancelotti was forced to name midfielders Federico Valverde and Aurelien Tchouameni in his backline alongside the inexperienced Raul Asencio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's deflected effort that came back off the crossbar seconds into the second half proved a turning point as Madrid again took control. Bellingham headed wide and Ederson denied Mbappé as the pressure built before it finally told on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé's finish was far from his cleanest but his mishit from Dani Ceballos' cross deceived Ederson and looped into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid smelt blood and went for the kill. Valverde drilled inches wide before Bellingham should have scored when he shot low into the legs of Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was City who got the third goal when Foden was brought down by Ceballos as he weaved a way into the penalty area and French referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland sent Courtois the wrong way for his 49th goal in 48 Champions League appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet, by full-time the Norwegian was a disconsolate figure as City's poor campaign took another turn for the worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds when he fired in against his old club after Ederson parried Vinicius' effort into his path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later the Brazilian goalkeeper was caught in no man's land as Vinicius ran through and, even as his attempt was heading wide, Bellingham stole in for a simple finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South China on Tuesday won the local top division basketball championship in dramatic fashion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guard So Pak-hin made a last-second shot as the Caroliners defeated Winling 81-79 in Game Four, for a three-one series win at the Southorn Stadium in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  South China entered the final period with a 20-point deficit, but they managed to erase it to take a one-point lead with a minute and a half to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bench players led the rally, with Anson Lam scoring 13 points in the final period.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the score tied in the final seconds, So, 23, hit a turnaround jumper with 0.3 seconds left to seal the classic victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Most Valuable Player of the Finals belonged to guard Kelvin Tsang from South China, who became Hong Kong champions for the third time in the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so glad we listened to the coach and didn't quit," Tsang told RTHK in a post-game interview.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

    Palace sink Doncaster, book clash with rivals Millwall

<img alt="Daniel Muñoz, left, celebrates scoring Crystal Palace's first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791105_1_20250211064509.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crystal Palace booked an FA Cup fifth round clash with south London rivals Millwall after a 2-0 win against fourth tier Doncaster.
 <br>
  <br>
  Oliver Glasner's side avoided a potential fourth round upset at the Eco-Power Stadium as Daniel Muñoz netted in the first half before Justin Devenny struck after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace will play second tier Millwall in the last 16 after the Lions won 2-0 at Championship leaders Leeds on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second time in three years that Palace have faced their hated neighbours in the FA Cup, with the Eagles winning 2-1 at The Den in the third round in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The local derby offers Palace forward Romain Esse a reunion with his former club after his US$14 million move from Millwall to Selhurst Park in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am told it will be a big derby. The game happened a few years ago? But it is good playing at home and it will be a great game for our fans," Glasner said of facing Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be very aggressive but playing at home to a Championship side means we have to win. I want to go to Wembley," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace, who finished as FA Cup runners-up in 2016 and 1990, are 12th in the Premier League and were beaten by Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles won 2-0 at Doncaster in the FA Cup fifth round six years ago and they repeated the scoreline on their latest visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could have decided it a bit earlier perhaps, but it was difficult circumstances with the pitch. The players did well most of the time and we scored nice goals," Glasner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncaster, currently third in League Two, kicked off as the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grant McCann's team threatened an early opener when Billy Sharp picked out Ethan Ennis in the penalty area, but his shot lacked the power to beat Palace keeper Matt Turner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace struggled to find any rhythm in the opening stages, but their superior quality finally shone through in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daichi Kamada's clever free-kick found Jean-Philippe Mateta beside the Doncaster wall and he fired against the post before Muñoz tapped in the deflected rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kamada tested Doncaster keeper Teddy Sharman-Lowe with a long-range blast as Palace hit their stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luke Molyneux, with 13 goals for Doncaster this season, nearly added to his tally as he cut in from the right flank and drilled just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  England left-back Ben Chilwell came on for his Palace debut at half-time following his loan move from Chelsea last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devenny squandered a golden opportunity to double Palace's lead when he blazed wide from Mateta's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 21-year-old midfielder made amends to kill off Doncaster in the 55th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Hughes's superb lofted pass sent Devenny scampering clear on goal and he guided a delicate chip over Sharman-Lowe from 12 yards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles soared to a crushing 40-22 Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, shattering their opponents' bid for a historic hat-trick of NFL titles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for another, as the Eagles avenged their agonising Super Bowl defeat to the Chiefs two years ago in emphatic style at New Orleans' Superdome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been able to use every experience and learn from it – the good, the bad, all of it – to pursue my own greatness," Hurts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I couldn't do any of these things without the guys around me," he added. "We had a special group this year – we were able to learn from the past, get some nice new pieces and get over that hump."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs had been bidding to become the first team in history to win three consecutive Vince Lombardi trophies following Super Bowl victories in 2023 and 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was sacked six times and threw two interceptions, never looked like leading his team to glory as the Eagles' iron defence and clinical offense dominated throughout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles effectively had the game won by half-time, powering into a 24-0 lead at the break after three unanswered touchdowns from Hurts, Cooper DeJean and AJ Brown.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended the lead to 34-0 late in the third quarter before Kansas City finally grabbed three late consolation touchdowns. Eagles kicker Jake Elliott bagged four field goals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) is demanding action from relevant authorities after two SAR ice hockey players were injured by their Turkmen counterparts at the Asian Winter Games on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two players are in a stable condition after getting checks by the team doctor and a local hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The altercation came at the end of the men's Group C match between Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan, which the SAR came away 5-1 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua news agency, scuffles broke out when the two sides were shaking hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating on social media showed multiple SAR players on the ice as they were attacked by their opponents. At least one of them, Alvin Sham, looked to be in pain as he clutched his head with both arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees and team officials then quickly intervened and broke up the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match report stated three Turkmen players were assessed "game misconduct" penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SF&OC strongly condemned what it called the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmen athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing video footage, Kenneth Fok, the Chef de Mission of Team Hong Kong, got in touch with relevant authorities and demanded disciplinary action be taken to ensure the personal safety of athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong won all three of its group matches and will fight for a quarter-final slot with Kyrgyzstan on Monday night.

    Plymouth stun Liverpool in FA Cup; Villa beat Spurs

<img alt="Liverpool's Diogo Jota walks off after the match. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790953_1_20250210060934.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool have suffered a stunning FA Cup exit in a 1-0 defeat to Championship strugglers Plymouth, while Aston Villa inflicted another damaging 2-1 defeat on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's decision to field a weakened team came back to haunt him, with Ryan Hardie's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset and ending Liverpool's quest for a quadruple at Home Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Cody Gakpo were among the stars rested as Slot made 10 changes from the team that thrashed Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a remarkably successful first season in charge of the Reds, it was a rare blunder by the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the fourth time that a team top of the Premier League had been eliminated from the FA Cup by a lower division club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masterminding a famous victory over Liverpool while fighting to haul Plymouth off the bottom of the Championship was no hardship for Argyle manager Miron Muslić, who was a refugee from war-torn Bosnia as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslić–hired by Plymouth to replace the sacked Wayne Rooney in January–was forced to move to Austria aged nine after escaping his home town of Bihac after it fell under siege by Serbian forces in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the third round, but their victory against West Brom last weekend was their first in the league since November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm speechless, and normally they tell me I'm eloquent! It's a big day for us," said Muslic. "It's a magical day. I told the lads in the locker room to enjoy it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the circumstances, Plymouth's superb performance will rank as one of the FA Cup's greatest giant-killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot wore an exasperated expression that summed up Liverpool's lethargy even before Darko Gyabi's overhead kick was blocked by Harvey Elliott's raised arm in the 54th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a clear penalty and Hardie kept his composure to send Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez were denied by fine saves from Conor Hazard in stoppage-time as Home Park erupted in celebration of an astonishing result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, fresh from their thrashing at Anfield to exit the League Cup on Thursday, another chance at ending Spurs' long wait for silverware went awry for the under-fire Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  The writing was on the wall for the visitors after just one minute when goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky let Jacob Ramsey's shot through his grasp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min missed a huge chance to level for an injury-ravaged Tottenham when he was denied by Emiliano Martinez before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Rogers sealed Spurs' fate when he blasted in from close range 25 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a trophy since 2008, Tottenham sit 14th in the Premier League and now have only Europa League glory to play for this season. (AFP)

<img alt="World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said China is a growing market for running and athletics. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790947_1_20250210025432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has praised China's exceptional capabilities in hosting major sporting events, citing the country's increasing athletic prowess, during his visit to attend the 9th Asian Winter Games underway in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN), Coe reaffirmed that China is "world-class" at staging global events, as he elaborated on the country's impressive track record in hosting successful international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is world-class at staging world class events. We have three world championships in the next 2 years in China. We have the world indoor championships in Nanjing in just a few weeks’ time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We then have the world relays in Guangzhou. And then the jewel in the crown in 2027 in Beijing is our world championships and it was in 2016 at the world championships in Beijing that I got elected as President of World Athletics. So, I consider China to be my lucky country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding his impression of Chinese athletes, Coe noted that he has seen significant progress as a result of close collaboration between World Athletics and major sports institutions in the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe also highlighted that China represents a vast and expanding market for running and athletics, which is playing a crucial role in promoting the participation of young people in sports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The importance of China to world athletics is huge. You have more people that are regularly running than any other country in the world, in 5K's and 10K's and half marathons and marathons. And that is a very large and growing market for world athletics," said the sports body president.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also critical because the Chinese government understands that running and athletics is probably one of the best sports for helping develop the health and vibrancy, both mentally and physically, of young people." (CCTV)

<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates winning his final match against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790942_1_20250210005525.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz clinched his first indoor title on Sunday, overpowering a spirited effort by Australia's Alex de Minaur to win the Rotterdam Open 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz had too much weight of shot off both flanks for his opponent, who retrieved valiantly but lacked the weapons to topple the top seed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz was first to seize the initiative, breaking De Minaur's serve in the third game, helped by a double-fault and some ferocious groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian, ranked eight in the world, struck back, breaking to love in the seventh game to bring the set back on serve at 4-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ill-judged drop shot at 0-30 down in the next game put the pressure back on De Minaur and Alcaraz produced a powerful backhand pass to give himself a chance to serve out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard secured the set at the first time of asking, De Minaur netting a forehand return and giving himself an uphill battle to get back into the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set saw a shift in momentum as De Minaur managed an early break of his own and raced into a 3-0 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur squandered two chances at a second break but clung on to his serve to give himself an opportunity to close out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  He levelled up the match at 1-1, as Alcaraz dumped a backhand into the net, having smashed two wild forehands long out of court earlier in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive set went with serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz got his nose in front, breaking the Australian's serve with a drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur served to stay in the match at 5-2 down but hit a catastrophic double-fault to give Alcaraz two match points.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then pushed a tired-looking backhand into the net to give Alcaraz victory and a 17th tour title, the Spaniard roaring "vamos" as the crowd rose to its feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  For De Minaur, it was a case of deja vu, as he lost in the final last year as well to world number one Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

 China unleashed an impressive display at the 9th Asian Winter Games in Harbin on Sunday, reinforcing its dominance in the overall medal standings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chinese athletes swept the podium positions in the ski mountaineering competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an exhilarating women's sprint final, Cidanyuzhen clinched gold with an outstanding time of 2 minutes and 55.88 seconds, while Yu Jingxuan and Suolangquzhen claimed silver and bronze.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old gold medalist was thrilled with her result, saying, "This is our first Asian Winter Games, and I'm very excited. The course was great, and I was able to race at my own pace."
  <br>
  <br>

 Hong Kong runners made great strides in the annual Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning despite the chilly weather, while the event was also marred by a number of disqualifications.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR runner Christy Yiu claimed victory in the women's half-marathon, crossing the finish line at Victoria Park in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 9 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her performance was within expectations, crediting the weather conditions for making the race smoother than she had anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson came second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half-marathon in about 2 hours and 24 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.
