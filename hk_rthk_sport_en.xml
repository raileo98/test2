<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 West Ham sacked manager Julen Lopetegui after just 22 games in charge, with former Chelsea boss Graham Potter expected to replace him at the London Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hammers are 14th in the Premier League table, seven points above the relegation zone, after just six wins in 20 league matches during the Spaniard's tenure.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 4-1 hammering at champions Manchester City on Saturday was the final straw for club chiefs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, 58, took training as usual on Tuesday and reported for work on Wednesday to be officially told his spell in charge was over.
  <br>
  <br>
  "West Ham United can confirm that head coach Julen Lopetegui has left the club," the Hammers said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The first half of the 2024 to 2025 season has not aligned with the club's ambitions and the club has therefore taken action in line with its objectives," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were among the biggest spenders in the Premier League in the summer transfer window, splashing out around US$155 million on players including Max Kilman, Crysencio Summerville and Niclas Fullkrug.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lopetegui won just one of his first six league games and oversaw several heavy defeats, including a 5-2 loss to Arsenal and a 5-0 drubbing by Liverpool, both at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Real Madrid and Spain boss was appointed in May last year to replace David Moyes, who left at the end of last season after a second spell at the London club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Scot, West Ham qualified for European competition for three consecutive seasons, winning the Europa Conference League in 2023 to secure the club's first major trophy in 43 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopetegui, who had previously managed Wolves in the Premier League, said at the time of his appointment he had other opportunities but he was "very happy that West Ham chose me because I chose West Ham too".
  <br>
  <br>
  In their search for a replacement for Lopetegui, the club reportedly spoke to former AC Milan boss Paulo Fonseca and ex-Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Potter is the hot favourite to replace Lopetegui, with the club understood to have held talks with the former Chelsea and Brighton manager about becoming their new manager, initially on a short-term deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potter, 49, has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea in April 2023, just seven months into a five-year contract. He won a mere 12 of his 31 matches in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Englishman began his managerial career at Swedish club Ostersund and had successful spells with Swansea and Brighton before taking over at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>

    Spurs snatch League Cup semi-final lead over Liverpool

<img alt="Lucas Bergvall celebrates after scoring his first goal for Tottenham. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786721_1_20250109070658.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lucas Bergvall condemned Liverpool to only their second defeat this season as the teenager's late strike earned Tottenham a controversial 1-0 win in the League Cup semi-final first leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bergvall struck with just four minutes left in north London, but Liverpool boss Arne Slot was furious that the Swede was still on the pitch to score his first goal for Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already on a yellow card, the 18-year-old had escaped a second booking moments earlier after tripping Kostas Tsimikas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsimikas was out of position after the tackle when Bergvall scored from an attack that started on the left flank vacated by the Liverpool defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's victory was a welcome tonic for Rodrigo Bentancur, who was taken to hospital after suffering a worrying injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bentancur stooped to head a corner in the seventh minute and stayed on the ground after falling unchallenged. His team-mates showed immediate concern and play was stopped as Bentancur received medical attention for nine minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old was given oxygen through a mask during the treatment as a hush fell on the capacity crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  At half-time, Tottenham moved to ease fears over Uruguay star Bentancur, who only recently returned from a seven-game ban for using a racial slur about teammate Son Heung-min.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm Rodrigo is conscious, talking and will go to hospital for further checks," the club said in a statement on X during the half-time interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to criticism of Tottenham's spluttering form and his attacking tactics, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou claimed earlier this term that he always wins a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The under-fire Australian could do with backing up that boast given Tottenham's poor form in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham last won a trophy when they lifted the League Cup in 2008 and the competition is shaping up as an opportunity to end that long silverware drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool won the League Cup last season in what proved to be Jurgen Klopp's last trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot has taken Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and the Champions League since replacing Klopp, making this a rare flop from the Reds under the Dutchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result was Liverpool's first defeat in 24 games in all competitions since a 1-0 loss to Nottingham Forest in the league in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the only other loss endured by Slot this season and, following Sunday's disappointing 2-2 draw with lowly Manchester United, he is facing the first test of his prolonged honeymoon period on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second leg at Anfield on February 6 will decide who advances to the final. (AFP)

    HK to send 74 athletes to Asian Winter Games in Harbin

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR will send its largest-ever delegation of 74 athletes to compete at the Asian Winter Games, which will be held in Harbin from the 7th to the 14th of next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a flag presentation ceremony on Wednesday, cultural and sports minister Rosanna Law said the Hong Kong, China team demonstrates the vitality and passion of the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the government has been making continuous efforts to train elite athletes, with the Sports Institute providing funding and support services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who will lead the 100-strong local delegation, said the youngest athlete is just 15 and Hong Kong will compete in curling for the very first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, the lawmaker said preparation hasn't been easy for the SAR athletes due to weather conditions and venue limitations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have our natural constraints. No matter with the hardware, software, and also our weather. It's very hard for an athlete to persistently do high-level training within Hong Kong itself. So we can already see their determination. Being able to represent Hong Kong is already a feat in itself," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that mainland provinces have provided strong support for athletes who need to train overseas or on the mainland.

    Undermanned Mavs cruise past Lakers; Timberwolves roll

<img alt="Mavericks guard Quentin Grimes (5) celebrates with teammate Maxi Kleber. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786610_1_20250108122043.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Quentin Grimes was the unlikely hero for Dallas as the injury-hit Mavericks out-classed LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 118-97 to snap a five-game losing streak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Grimes came off the bench to score 23 points and grab nine rebounds, drilling six of the Mavericks' 18 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas, last season's Western Conference champions, had gone 1-5 since losing Luka Doncic to a calf strain on Christmas Day. Still without the Slovenian star, they announced on Monday that Kyrie Irving would be sidelined for some time with a lower back sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by as many as six in the second quarter, the Mavs closed the first half on an 11-0 scoring run to take a 55-50 lead and never trailed in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis scored 21 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Lakers and James added 18 points, 10 boards and eight assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Dallas out-rebounded the Lakers 44-33 and with 11 offensive rebounds managed 15 second-chance points to the Lakers' seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  P.J. Washington scored 22 points, Spencer Dinwiddie added 19 and Klay Thompson chipped in 13 for Dallas – who bumped the Lakers from fifth place in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew we had to get back on track," Grimes told broadcaster TNT. "Came out with the right mindset after dropping five in a row, so good to get back on track."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach JJ Redick said his team's inability to defend the perimeter was key.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of the energy, It felt like we played a little tired tonight," he said. "When you're on the road and the other team is banging threes, it can be a little deflating to the overall energy."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in New Orleans, Anthony Edwards scored 32 points with nine rebounds to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 104-97 victory over the Pelicans, spoiling Pels star Zion Williamson's return from a two-month injury absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Williamson scored 22 points with six rebounds, four assists and three steals. Dejounte Murray led New Orleans with 29 points, but CJ McCollum had a rough night – scoring just five points on one-for-14 shooting. (AFP)

    Newcastle beat Arsenal in League Cup semis first leg

<img alt="Alexander Isak opened the scoring for Newcastle during their English League Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786563_1_20250108071526.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle took a giant stride towards the League Cup final as goals from Alexander Isak and Anthony Gordon earned a 2-0 semi-final, first leg lead at Arsenal.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies have never previously won the competition and have had to wait since 1969 to celebrate any major trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in Isak they have the form striker in England right now and he rifled home the opener then helped tee up the second for Gordon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have a mountain to climb when the sides meet for the second leg on February 5 if they are to progress to meet either Tottenham or Liverpool in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The importance of silverware to both clubs was reflected in the line-ups, as Mikel Arteta and Eddie Howe named their strongest available teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has brought Arsenal back into contention for Premier League titles in recent seasons, but his only trophy in charge of the Gunners came five years ago by lifting the FA Cup in the early months of his reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were able to welcome back Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli from the side that started the 1-1 draw at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's lack of a lethal striker like Isak proved the difference between the sides. Arsenal had the majority of the ball and the chances but failed to make them count.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martinelli came closest when he raced onto Leandro Trossard's pass and smashed against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later came the sucker punch. Arsenal, so renowned for their own set-piece threat, allowed a long free-kick into their box to fall at the feet of Isak who fired in off the underside of the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swede's 14th goal in his last 15 games took him to 50 in a Newcastle shirt – doing so in five fewer matches than it took the club's record goalscorer Alan Shearer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak had a major role to play in what could be a decisive second goal in the tie just after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the Newcastle striker's quick feet allowed him to get a shot off that was parried by David Raya into the path of the onrushing Gordon to fire in the rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal should still have made their mammoth task for the return leg in Tyneside next month a more manageable one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz somehow miscued a header wide with the goal gaping to cut the arrears. Howe replaced Isak and Gordon as Newcastle were happy to just to protect their lead in a 5-5-0 formation for the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, though, lacked the guile to break them down without the injured Bukayo Saka to seemingly extend their wait for Arteta's revolution to deliver another trophy. (AFP)

 Didier Deschamps, France's longest serving national team coach, will reportedly not seek to renew his contract which expires in 2026, according to the French Football Federation.
 <br>
  <br>
  Deschamps' deal runs until after the next World Cup, for which Les Bleus have yet to qualify.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old took over from fellow 1998 World Cup winner Laurent Blanc in 2012 and led Les Bleus to the World Cup title in 2018, two years after reaching the European Championship final on home soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former France captain, one of only three to win football's most prestigious prize as a player and a coach, guided the national team to the World Cup final again in 2022 – losing to Argentina on penalties after one of the best matches in the tournament's history. (Reuters)

<img alt="The extension will keep the South Korean international at the club for an additional 12 months. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786555_1_20250108053528.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tottenham have exercised the option to extend captain Son Heung-min's contract until June 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Son's deal, which he signed in 2021, was due to expire at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean, 32, joined the Premier League club in 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen and has made 431 appearances, scoring 169 goals – fourth on Tottenham's all-time list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son was named club captain in August 2023, and shared the Premier League's Golden Boot with Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah in the 2021 to 2022 season after scoring 23 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is also captain of South Korea, making 131 appearances to date and scoring 51 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the current season, he has scored seven goals in all competitions in a struggling Spurs side who are 12th in the Premier League table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham said the South Korea international had become a “global star” and a “modern-day great” in his time at the club.
  <br>
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 This year's Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup football competition will highlight a roster of young players from the SAR, as Hong Kong, China aim to nurture a new generation of talent for international play.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first leg of the tournament will take place at Yuexiushan Stadium in Guangdong on January 15, while the SAR will host the return leg at Hong Kong Stadium on January 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darren Arnott, head coach of the youth divisions, will be leading the Hong Kong, China team of 37 players, with 29 of them under the age of 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China (HKFA), said on Tuesday that the experience will be crucial in encouraging young players to take on a key role in football development in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the main initiatives of the HKFA is to develop more young players and give them more opportunities to play and train. So under this strategy, we have a number of initiatives," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that at the last Asian Games at Hangzhou, it was mainly comprised of the youth team U-23. We had a historic result in the Asian Games, which showed that Hong Kong has a bright future and we have many good quality youth players."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok also said the association has established a league for younger players and set up a training base in Guangxi to provide players with better facilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong Stadium will host the second leg of the Guangdong-Hong Kong Cup to accommodate a larger crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK will broadcast both matches live.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok added that the HKFA is in discussions with Kai Tak Sports Park about the possibility of hosting the home games for the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, starting with the match against India in June.

    Forest thump Wolves for sixth straight top-flight win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chris Wood scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season as third-placed Nottingham Forest beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-0 at Molineux Stadium, keeping them on course for an unlikely title challenge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White and substitute Taiwo Awoniyi were also on target for the visitors as they won their sixth top-flight game in a row, the first time they have managed that feat since 1979 under then manager Brian Clough.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest have 40 points from 20 games, six behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Forest's tally is the same number as Leicester City had accumulated by the same point of the 2015-2016 campaign when they went on to become shock Premier League champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is about consistency and doing what we have been doing extremely well already this season. Not letting up halfway through. We need to keep going," Wood said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about confidence, belief and responsibility, and a team that works to all of our strengths," he added. "It is not the same every week, we try to tweak things to get better. It is well and truly too early to talk about a title challenge, we are not thinking about that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves had their chances, not least striker Jorgen Strand Larsen who might have had a hat-trick but was wasteful in front of goal. They have 16 points from 20 games and are only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Wolves player Gibbs-White gave the visitors the lead inside seven minutes. A lightning counter-attack saw the midfielder feed Anthony Elanga and when he took the return pass, Gibbs-White fired low into the bottom right corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves should have gone level when Strand Larsen had a tap-in three metres from goal, but the forward saw his effort blocked on the line by Murillo with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen had another excellent chance with a header that was saved from point-blank range by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime with an almost inevitable Wood goal. Callum Hudson-Odoi made a storming run down the left wing and, after holding off Matt Doherty, pulled the ball back for a side-footed finish from the New Zealand striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strand Larsen forced another good save from Sels, but the chances dried up for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Awoniyi completed a perfect night for the visitors when he got his first goal since February after he was teed-up by fellow substitute James Ward-Prowse. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Rugby Sevens in March will be held at the Kai Tak Stadium for the first time. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786277_1_20250106110908.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong China Rugby on Monday said the first Rugby Sevens tournament to be held at the new stadium in Kai Tak will be a next-level event.
 <br>
  <br>
  James Farndon, Hong Kong China Rugby CEO, made the comments after authorities said the first test event at the main stadium of the Kai Tak Sports Park went well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon said his operations team is now busy with debriefing and reviewing with stakeholders ahead of the Rugby Sevens, which will be held at the end of March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong Sevens is famous around the world, of course, as the event that every Sevens player wants to play in. And I think the first tournament in the new stadium is going to take that to an even higher level," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said athletes and fans are excited about the new state-of-the-art venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players will be able to enjoy [the experience] in the much better surroundings of Kai Tak which is also more conducive to enhancing their performance slightly on the pitch, so that'll be great for the players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon noted that the stadium in Kai Tak was at 20 percent capacity during Sunday's test.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Based on the atmosphere we had, I think the fans are in for something really incredible" during the Rugby Sevens, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pointed out that the new South Stand will be bigger and would overlook the Hong Kong skyline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Probably the most unique feature in the stadium is the window looking out on the Hong Kong skyline on the South Stand terrace, and that's going to make the experience even more memorable for fans."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A dominant United States lifted their second United Cup mixed team tournament title in three years after they beat Poland 2-0, with Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz both winning their singles matches.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top seeds in the US$10 million tournament that began with 18 nations in contention clinched the trophy when Fritz defeated Hubert Hurkacz 6-4 5-7 7-6(4), after Coco Gauff outclassed Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in Sydney.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Americans had also won the 2023 title in the inaugural edition of the tournament, which serves as a tune-up event for the Australian Open Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the second singles contest locked at one set apiece, Fritz raised his level at 3-3 in the tiebreak of the decider to see off Hurkacz and spark huge celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gauff earlier stepped up preparations for the year's first major that begins next Sunday with a second successive win over world number two Swiatek in a blockbuster showdown that gave fans at the Ken Rosewall Arena their money's worth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number three, who beat Swiatek en route to the WTA Finals title last season, squandered a 2-0 lead in the first set but battled back from there to gain the upper hand in the match as her opponent counted the costs of 19 unforced errors.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another high-octane set that followed, Gauff recovered a break to level at 4-4 and went on to secure the win that ensured she ended her singles campaign at the tournament unbeaten. (Reuters)

    Dembélé powers PSG to 3rd straight French Super Cup

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ousmane Dembélé scored a stoppage-time winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Monaco 1-0 to win the Champions Trophy for the third consecutive season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The France winger was unmarked at the back post to meet a low cross from the left by Fabián Ruiz in the second minute of added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG won the trophy, also known as the French Super Cup, for a record-extending 13th overall. PSG won the league and cup double last season, with Monaco finishing second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The result reflects our domination,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said, while Monaco coach Adi Hütter conceded PSG played better.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A goal in the last minute always feels like a knife in the back,” Hütter said. “PSG deserved to win if we're being honest, they had more chances.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match took place at Stadium 974 in Doha, Qatar, with PSG owned by Qatar-based QSI since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Désiré Doué hit the crossbar early on for PSG and Monaco goalkeeper Philipp Köhn made several saves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Monaco improved after the break and hit the post through Eliesse Ben Seghir and Brazilian defender Vanderson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Köhn made a fine save to deny Achraf Hakimi in the 74th minute, he failed to properly read Ruiz's cross and Monaco missed out on winning the trophy for the first time since 2000. (AP)

    Diallo earns Man Utd thrilling 2-2 draw with Liverpool

<img alt="Manchester United's Amad Diallo celebrates after scoring his side's second goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786247_1_20250106054913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Amad Diallo came back to haunt Liverpool with a late equaliser that secured a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against the Premier League leaders.
 <br>
  <br>
  The forward turned home Alejandro Garnacho’s cross in the 80th minute at Anfield after Mohamed Salah’s penalty had looked like giving Liverpool the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo struck at the end of extra time as United beat Liverpool 4-3 in a dramatic FA Cup clash last season and hit a 90th-minute winner against Manchester City last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  His goal was only worth a point on this occasion, but it halted United's four-game losing run and prevented fierce rival Liverpool from opening up an eight-point lead at the top of the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  United head coach Ruben Amorim, however, was still unhappy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s a point, a deserved point – but it’s just one point," he said. "We should get mad. Today we should be really disappointed."
  <br>
  <br>
  United led through Lisandro Martínez’s strike in the 52nd, but Cody Gakpo levelled seven minutes later. Salah fired Liverpool ahead from the spot in the 70th after Matthijs de Ligt handled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  The draw saw United move up to 13th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool missed the chance to open up an eight-point lead on second-place Arsenal, which drew 1-1 with Brighton on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds are still six points clear at the top with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Over the whole game we created more chances than them; a point feels like it’s something to take, but when I watch the game back I would hope for more,” Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  United is without a win at Anfield since 2016 – a run that spans nine matches in all competitions. But it was a first point for Ruben Amorim's team since the 2-1 win against Manchester City on December 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could have been better for United, with Harry Maguire firing over from close range deep into added time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had its chances to win as well, with Virgil van Dijk firing a header straight at United goalkeeper Andre Onana late on.
  <br>
  <br>
  With 39 top-flight titles between them, this was the latest meeting between English football's two greatest teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool has the chance to equal United’s record total of 20 league crowns this season and could have taken a firmer hold on the title race with a win in front of its home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But United produced a performance that confounded its recent form, which has even had Amorim admitting his team could face a relegation fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve been fairly criticised because the position in the table says it all," United captain Bruno Fernandes said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think it’s a fair result, both teams played really good football. But we can’t be satisfied," he added. "I’m really upset, because if we can show this against Liverpool – why can’t we do this every week?”
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo and Rasmus Hojlund had chances in the first half before Martínez lashed a left-footed shot into the roof of the net from a narrow angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister had seen Liverpool’s best effort in the first half saved by Onana, but the keeper could do nothing to stop Gakpo’s powerful shot after cutting onto his right foot in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review led to referee Michael Oliver awarding Liverpool a penalty after the ball struck De Ligt’s arm and Salah fired low to score his 21st goal of the season. He has scored 13 goals against United – more than any other player in Premier League history.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it wasn’t enough to earn Liverpool the win after substitute Garnacho cut the ball back for Diallo to convert.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The way we conceded the two goals was unacceptable, lazy and careless," Van Dijk said. "It shouldn’t happen.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Frenchman Alexandre Muller on Sunday earned a major confidence boost as he lifted his first-career ATP Tour finals crown after downing Japan's Kei Nishikori 2-6, 6-1, 6-3 to win the Hong Kong Tennis Open final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Muller, 27, fell behind early as Nishikori claimed the opening set.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he refused to go down quietly, dominating the second and third to deny the 35-year-old Japanese of his 13th tour-level championship in an intense showdown lasting one hour and 43 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy to get a title here in Hong Kong," Muller told reporters in a post-match interview. "It's been a long and tough week for me, losing the first set in all the matches – so I'm just very happy about my first title."
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory caps off a stellar week of play for Muller, who is now projected to rise eleven places in the world rankings to a career-high 56th as he gears up to face Czech Jakub Mensik in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked how he would celebrate his maiden trophy, Muller kept it light-hearted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not the kind of guy who would go to nightclubs and stuff like this," he joked.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe just a light dinner with my team, as I got my flight to Auckland tomorrow. That's tennis life – enjoying your title for a few hours before we go again."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nishikori was competing in first final in six years. Speaking to reporters after the match, the world number 106 cited tiredness as one of the main reasons for the way he played in the second and third sets, but remained pleased in his overall performance nonetheless ahead of the Australian Open come January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very disappointed in how I played in the second and third," Nishikori said. "I think there are more chances to win a few matches in Australia, but I am still on the way."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can play good in some moments, but I still got ups-and-downs so I got to keep working on it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, Dutchman Sander Arends and Briton Luke Johnson won the men's doubles.
  <br>
  <br>
  They dispatched world number eight Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov from Russia, 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 in an hour and 33 minutes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Runners who took part in this year’s Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge Half Marathon said they were happy with the arrangements after issues were raised in the event’s inaugural edition in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Around 7,000 people took part in Sunday's race, which covered the local section of the 55-kilometre mega-bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race for the challenge group of runners started at 7.15am, and the remaining three non-challenge groups began in batches about half an hour later.
  <br>
  <br>
  A runner from Yunnan, surnamed Jian, said she previously ran in the plateau and wanted to experience something different.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Running here is totally different. You're on the bridge and over the sea, while elsewhere it's just road running. I think the arrangement is pretty good. The volunteers are really enthusiastic and there are clear signs,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some runners who participated in the November 2023 race complained about not being offered enough sports drinks or snacks, as well as the lack of toilets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year’s race is designated a Gold Label Road Race by World Athletics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many elite marathon runners took part, including Japan’s Yuki Kawauchi, who won the 2018 Boston Marathon as an amateur runner. “I'm happy to see so many runners cheering for me,” he spoke through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopian Milkesa Mengesha came first in the challenge group in just over an hour, while Grace Nawowuna from Kenya took the women’s title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong See-yeung and Virginia Lo were the first SAR man and woman to finish the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chong, who also ran in 2023, said the facilities, including the toilets, were much better compared with the previous race.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that he was thrilled and honoured to be able to run alongside Kawauchi.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel very inspired because he is a role model for me. As an Asian athlete with a larger build similar to mine, he resonates with me. He started as a recreational runner and has achieved results comparable to, or even better than, professional athletes. This serves as a great motivation for us,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lo, meanwhile, was about 40 seconds off her personal best. She said the overall experience was great, though the uphill tunnel section was the toughest part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law called the start of the challenge group race.
  <br>
  <br>
  She and other officials, including justice chief Paul Lam and security minister Chris Tang, took part in a special 2-kilometre race.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Midway through the race I noticed the sunrise is magnificent. So, it’s really half sports, half tourism,” Law said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates also told me that for future large-scale events, they plan to invite not just elite runners from abroad but also those who are overseas travellers. When they come, there’s no reason to just run the marathon – they'll likely stay a night and spend money. I totally support this idea.”
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, 19 runners said they felt unwell and suffered injuries and three were sent to hospital for treatment as of 11am.

<img alt="Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens finishes the regular season with 4,172 yards passing and 915 yards rushing, the best combined record for an NFL quarterback.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamar Jackson threw two touchdown passes and the Baltimore Ravens won the AFC North for the second straight season, clinching the division with a 35-10 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the other NFL game on Saturday, the Cincinnati Bengals kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 19-17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Ravens (12-5) will open the playoffs at home against either the Los Angeles Chargers or Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baltimore was two games behind the Steelers in the division before winning its final four to finish on top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson threw TD passes to Mark Andrews in the second quarter and Rashod Bateman in the third, finishing a spectacular statistical season that might be good enough to earn him a third MVP award.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished the season with 4,172 yards passing, 41 touchdown passes and only four interceptions. He became the first quarterback to reach 4,000 yards passing with 40 TD passes and four or fewer interceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jackson also finished the season with 915 yards rushing, becoming the first to throw for 4,000 yards and rush for at least 800. His passer rating of 119.6 wasn't quite enough to break the single-season record of 122.5 held by Aaron Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest concern coming out of this game for the Ravens was the health of Pro Bowl receiver Zay Flowers, who left in the second quarter with a right knee injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland (3-14) ended a dreadful season with six straight losses. Both Bailey Zappe and Dorian Thompson-Robinson took snaps at quarterback in the finale. Neither could move the ball much, and Zappe had an interception returned 26 yards for a touchdown by rookie Nate Wiggins for the game's first points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Pittsburgh, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow passed for 277 yards and a touchdown and Cade York kicked four field goals in Cincinnati's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burrow also threw an interception and his NFL record streak of consecutive games with at least 250 yards passing and three touchdowns came to an end. But he did enough to propel the Bengals (9-8) to their fifth straight win and keep them in the mix until the season's final day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cincinnati will earn the seventh seed in the AFC if Denver loses to Kansas City and Miami either loses to or ties the New York Jets on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pittsburgh is assured of playing next week despite a four-game losing streak. The Steelers will be the fifth seed if the Chargers lose at Las Vegas. If the Chargers win, Pittsburgh will be the sixth seed and travel to rival Baltimore in the first round. (AP)

    City crush West Ham; Arsenal, Chelsea settle for draws

<img alt="Manchester City's Erling Haaland scores City's second goal past West Ham United's Alphonse Areola. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786172_1_20250105083027.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Erling Haaland and Manchester City might just be turning the corner after the team's worst run of results under Pep Guardiola.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haaland scored twice in a 4-1 win over West Ham on Saturday as City secured back-to-back victories in the Premier League for the first time since late October, when a shocking and unthinkable six-week meltdown began.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that time, the defending champions played nine league games and won just once, dropping them out of the Champions League qualification spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, City can hope for better times ahead - making up ground on second-placed Arsenal and fourth-placed Chelsea after they both dropped points in draws at Brighton and Crystal Palace, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Guardiola wasn't getting carried away.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very pleased for the result," he said, “but you cannot ask me if the old City is back. If you saw the game, we are not.”
  <br>
  <br>
  However, while the 2-0 win at Leicester last weekend was unconvincing, there were better signs against West Ham - at least in attack with Haaland looking sharp. The Norway striker headed in Savinho's cross to make it 2-0 in the 42nd minute and chipped the goalkeeper for 3-0 in the 55th after running onto another pass from Savinho.
  <br>
  <br>
  Either side, there was an own-goal and a strike from Phil Foden before Niclas Fullkrug pulled one back for West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are still not like we were, for different reasons,” Guardiola said. "The result will help. We struggle but it is a release.”
  <br>
  <br>
  City stayed in sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, it was a good day for Liverpool - and the league leader didn't even play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were held to 1-1 at Brighton, which equalised from the penalty spot through Joao Pedro, and missed the chance to trim the gap to Liverpool to three points. Ethan Nwaneri put Arsenal ahead and, at age 17, became only the sixth player under 18 to score multiple Premier League goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton's penalty was awarded after Arsenal defender William Saliba was adjudged to have clashed heads with Pedro as they challenged for a bouncing ball. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta was disappointed with the call, saying: “I have never seen a decision like this in my career. I asked the boys if they have and nobody has seen it before.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's winless run in the league extended to four matches after drawing at Palace 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jean-Philippe Mateta equalised in the 82nd for Palace, cancelling out Cole Palmer's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea have drawn twice and lost twice since December 22, damaging a title bid that had been picking up some steam, even if manager Enzo Maresca never accepted his team was a realistic challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We still created so many chances in front of goal but it's about getting the end product," Chelsea winger Jadon Sancho said. “We're still playing the same football, we are still giving 100 percent. This is what happens in football.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead Arsenal by five points and Chelsea by nine, and have two games in hand over both rivals. The first comes at home to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak scored in a seventh straight Premier League game to earn Newcastle a 2-1 win at injury-hit Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker grabbed the 38th-minute winner and there was a hint of fortune about it, with Tottenham defender Radu Drăgușin getting the slightest of touches on a cross and deflecting the ball onto the foot of Isak. The ball dribbled into the net for Isak's 13th goal of the season, and ninth in his past seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thomas Tuchel was in the stands in his first scouting mission in his role as the recently hired England coach. Two players likely to be in his first squad, to be announced in March for World Cup qualifiers, got on the score sheet in the opening six minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham ahead in the fourth minute, and Anthony Gordon equalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a fifth straight win for fifth-placed Newcastle, while Tottenham stayed in the bottom half of the standings with just one point from their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were beaten by Brentford 5-0 at home for a third straight defeat under Ivan Juric, who was hired last month to replace the fired Russell Martin. Southampton have one point from four games under Juric and just six points overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo scored two of Brentford's goals and has 13 for the season in the league. It was Brentford's biggest ever win in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat Leicester 2-1, while Bournemouth won at home to Everton 1-0 and was eight games unbeaten - a club record in their time in the Premier League. (AP)

    Heat suspend Jimmy Butler and will seek to trade him

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat suspended Jimmy Butler for seven games on Friday and said they will seek to trade him.
 <br>
  <br>
  The NBA team said the suspension was for “conduct detrimental to the team over the course of the season and particularly the last several weeks.”
  <br>
  <br>
  “Through his actions and statements, he has shown he no longer wants to be part of this team,” the Heat said in a statement, one day after Butler said in a post-game press conference that he does not believe he can be happy playing in Miami going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will lose about US$336,543 per game during the suspension, or about US$2,355,798 in all. He has the right to an appeal, which could lessen the financial hit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler will not be with the team for its home game on Saturday against Utah and then the totality of a six-game road trip to Sacramento, Golden State, Utah, Portland, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In theory, the earliest that Butler could play again for the Heat is January 17 at home against Denver. But he has likely played for Miami for the final time. (AP)

    Teen darts sensation Littler wins PDC world title

<img alt="17-year-old Luke 'The Nuke' Littler celebrates becoming the youngest-ever world champion. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786125_1_20250104152712.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seventeen-year-old sensation Luke 'The Nuke' Littler thrashed Michael van Gerwen 7-3 on Friday to become the youngest ever PDC darts world champion and bank a 500,000 pound (US$621,600) winner's cheque.
 <br>
  <br>
  The duel for the biggest prize in darts, in front of 3,200 rowdy fans in fancy dress, ended in a crushing defeat for three times winner Van Gerwen, 35, in his seventh final at North London's 'Ally Pally' Alexandra Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't believe it. Honestly, I can't believe it," gasped the teenager, tears in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The phenomenon, whose meteoric rise started by throwing magnetic darts as a toddler, had finally achieved the dream after losing 7-4 last year in a final that made him a household name.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We both played so well. I said in my interviews, I needed to get off to a quick start tonight and that's what I did.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone dreams of lifting this trophy but you've got to get through a tough field."
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler took a cagey opening set and then found his rhythm with two quick 180s to go 2-0 up, winning six of the first seven legs, as Van Gerwen's finishing touch failed him and he grimaced in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen, who will walk away 200,000 pounds richer as runner-up, won the opening leg of the third set but it proved a false dawn as an implacable Littler raced 4-0 clear with a bullseye finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch 'Green Machine', who set the previous record for youngest world champion as a 24-year-old in 2014, showed he was still in the fight by taking the fifth set but the comeback faltered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Littler, hand steady and gaze unwavering, fired in quick back-to-back 180s to take the opening leg of the sixth and then banged in two more maximum scores to secure the set and forge 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen raised his game to pull back to 5-2 but Littler, who ended the tournament with the most 180s, whitewashed the next set to restore his advantage to 6-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another set to the Dutchman only postponed the inevitable as Littler, who turns 18 on January 21, romped through the final set to get his hands on the mighty Sid Waddell Trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pent-up emotion was finally released by two bullseyes and a double 16 to check out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I learnt a lot last year," he said as the celebrations died down. "Earlier today I watched all of the (2024 final) game back against Luke (Humphries) and I had the visions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could end 2025 winning absolutely nothing (more) but I've picked up one of the best."
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Gerwen said he had not done himself justice, and it hurt, "but that's the way it is.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Fair play to him. Every chance he got, every moment he had to hurt me, he did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I sometimes say every 17 years a star gets born and he's one of them." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo is the early leader in fan balloting for the NBA All-Star Game, and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers seems well on his way toward extending his record and getting picked for a 21st time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The first update on All-Star voting for this season's revised game was released saw Antetokounmpo as the overall leader with about 1.7 million votes. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokić of the Denver Nuggets is second overall with about 1.4 million votes, which tops all Western Conference players.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte's LaMelo Ball led East guards with 947,444 votes, with Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell second on 718,084 and Milwaukee's Damian Lillard third on 704,914.
  <br>
  <br>
  There won't be ten starters this year for the All-Star Game, which is set to take place on Febuary 16 in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  2025 marks the first year of a new All-Star format, one where there will be three games. The 24 All-Stars will be drafted into three teams of eight players apiece by TNT personalities and former NBA greats Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams will be entered into a four-team tournament, with the remaining squad being the team of NBA rookies and second-year players that wins the Rising Stars event on All-Star Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are two semifinal games, followed by the winners meeting in a championship game – with the first team to reach 40 points the winner of all three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be wildly different than last year, when the All-Star Game final score was 211-186 – the highest-scoring one in history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Voting continues through January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan voting makes up 50 percent of the All-Star starter selection formula, with media voting accounting for another 25 percent and voting by current NBA players counting for the remaining 25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ten players designated as starters – even though there technically will be at least 15 starters in the All-Star “games” – will be announced on January 23, and the reserves that will be selected by NBA head coaches will be announced on January 30. (AP/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Andrey Rublev's Australian Open preparations took an unexpected hit as the top seed was dumped out of the Hong Kong Open in the second round by Fabian Marozsan on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With the first Grand Slam of the year just over a week away, the Hungarian ranked 58th in the world won 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in just under two hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old faces China's Shang Juncheng, 19, in the last eight at Victoria Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian Rublev, ranked eighth, was the defending Hong Kong champion and had been pursuing a 76th tour-level quarter-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was no such trouble for second seed Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, who defeated Canadian qualifier Gabriel Diallo 6-4, 6-3.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Elena Rybakina's Kazakhstan dumped defending champions Germany out of the United Cup with Alexander Zverev sidelined by an arm injury barely a week away from the Australian Open, while top seeds USA beat China to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Sydney, women's world number two Iga Swiatek led Poland into the last eight by winning a rematch of her 2023 French Open final against the Czech Republic's Karolina Muchova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain also progressed to the quarter-finals with Katie Boulter's dominant 6-2, 6-1 victory over Australia's Olivia Gadecki enough to guarantee they won their group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The upset in Perth sent the Kazakhs into the semi-finals of the 18-nation tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sixth-ranked Rybakina earned the first point for Kazakhstan, with the 2022 Wimbledon champion hammering Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev then withdrew from his clash against Alexander Shevchenko at the last minute with a bicep strain, leaving the 254th-ranked Daniel Masur to face him.
  <br>
  <br>
  He put up a brave fight but Shevchenko was too strong, powering home 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-2 despite a medical timeout in the second set, complaining about difficulty breathing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was struggling in this heat, it was so rough," said the world number 78, who upset Stefanos Tsitsipas in group play on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had a headache and my head was spinning, but I wanted to win this one." added Shevchenko. "After [losing] the first set, I knew I had to shorten the rallies and play aggressively."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other quarter-final, 2023 winners United States beat China thanks to singles rubber wins by Coco Gauff and Taylor Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  World number three Gauff beat Zhang Shuai 7-6 (7/4), 6-2, and Fritz then put the tie beyond the Chinese with a 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Zhang Zhizhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Coco did such a good job putting us ahead and giving me the chance to come out and put us through," said Fritz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a little bit of pressure because I didn't want to be the one who loses it for the team after Coco won all her matches this week," he added. "I played a really solid match – really happy with it." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal closed the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool to six points as Gabriel Jesus extended his hot-streak in a 3-1 win at Brentford on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Arteta's side were rocked by Bryan Mbeumo's first-half goal at the Gtech Community Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal refused to be blown away on a wet and windy evening in west London as Jesus equalised before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Brazilian's sixth goal in his last four games after he scored just once in his first 20 matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino and Gabriel Martinelli netted in quick succession soon after half-time to ensure Arsenal moved into second place above Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We won in a difficult stadium against a good opponent. The record they have here is incredible and when you go 1-0 down it makes it even harder," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially when you go a goal down early in the game it becomes a mountain to climb, but we remained patient," he added. "We had to manage the situation emotionally. We were very clinical in the box. Jesus's form is very important."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding their 5-1 rout of Crystal Palace, the Gunners had spluttered through their last four league games with lacklustre draws against Fulham and Everton followed by a narrow win over lowly Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal's first Premier League game of 2025 provided compelling evidence that they are ready to compete in the title race with Liverpool, who have a game in hand on the north Londoners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Runners-up to Manchester City for the last two seasons, Arsenal are unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions, a revitalising run that now includes four successive wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can only win our next match and see what happens. It's not in our hands," Arteta said of chasing Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Bukayo Saka sidelined for several months due to a hamstring injury, 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri made his first league start for Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz was absent after scoring Arsenal's winner against Ipswich, but Jesus ensured the German was not missed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal did not lose a single one of their 10 league London derbies in 2024 and they maintained their impressive record in capital clashes after surviving an early blow. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce led all players in fan voting for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games, the NFL said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelce, whose romance with Taylor Swift brought the NFL to the attention of the pop megastar's legion of fans, finished with 252,200 votes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs was second overall with 250,082 votes and Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has helped the Commanders into the playoffs, was third with 242,352.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lions led all clubs in total votes received, followed by the Minnesota Vikings, Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selections for the Pro Bowl Games rosters for the AFC and NFC are determined by a combination of voting by fans, players and coaches, with each group's vote counting for one-third of the tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL's all-star event will be staged February 2 in Orlando, Florida, for the second consecutive year as 88 players take part in skills competitions, including a flag football showdown with former NFL star quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning serving as coaches. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Plymouth Argyle have mutually agreed to part ways with head coach Wayne Rooney after just over seven months in charge, the second-tier Championship club said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rooney had replaced Ian Foster in May on a three-year deal at Plymouth. However, the team struggled under his leadership, failing to win away this season, and are bottom with 18 points from 23 games, four points adrift of the safety zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Manchester United and England forward oversaw 25 matches in all competitions before his departure.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the second setback for Rooney in 2024 following his dismissal as Birmingham City head coach in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First team coach Kevin Nancekivell and club captain Joe Edwards will lead the team for our Championship match against Bristol City on New Year’s Day," Plymouth said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rooney added: "Plymouth Argyle will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will continue to look out for and take interest in their results.”
  <br>
  <br>
  He was appointed Birmingham manager in October 2023 when they were sixth but sacked in January after they fell to 20th in the league.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Hart delivered his third triple double of the season on to spark the New York Knicks in a 126-106 victory at Washington that stretched their win streak to eight games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hart had 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his ninth triple double with the Knicks while Karl-Anthony Towns had a game-high 32 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson and O.G. Anunoby each scored 18 points for New York, which improved to 23-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks led 59-57 at halftime over the Eastern Conference doormats, and pulled away in the third quarter and dominated the fourth to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We executed. We got stops and we played fast," Hart said. "We played to our strengths. Sometimes it takes us a little while to wake up – we always do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, at New Orleans, James Harden sank four free throws in the final 17 seconds to give the Los Angeles Clippers a 116-113 victory over the host Pelicans – as the NBA's worst club dropped a 10th consecutive game to sink to 5-28 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norman Powell scored a game-high 35 points, while Harden added 27 as the Clippers improved to 19-13.
  <br>

  Elsewhere, Chicago's Coby White had 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to spark the Bulls to a 115-108 overtime victory at Charlotte.

  Miles Bridges, who hit a 3-pointer with one second remaining in regulation to force overtime at 98-98, had a game-high 31 points for the Hornets. (AFP)

    Villa held by Brighton after late Lamptey equaliser

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.

  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)

    Haliburton leads Pacers over Celtics; Magic hang on

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points as the Pacers turned the tables on the NBA champion Celtics with a confident 123-114 victory in Boston.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after Jaylen Brown's 44 points propelled the Celtics to a 142-105 blowout victory over the Pacers, Indiana got their revenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haliburton added six rebounds and seven assists without a turnover and six players scored in double figures for Indiana, whose lights-out shooting in the second quarter saw them seize a seven-point halftime lead that they would push to as many as 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown stayed hot, delivering 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting with six assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each for Indiana, with Nembhard adding eight rebounds and eight assists as he returned after missing Friday's game with left knee tendinitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nembhard said maintaining their pace in the fourth quarter – when Boston cut an 11-point deficit to two with seven and a half minutes to play, was key for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that was the biggest thing we did late in the game," he said. "We kept pace in the game. We didn't slow it down and worry about the score too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Orlando, Cole Anthony drove for the game-winning layup as the Magic erased a 21-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Tristan da Silva scored 21 points to lead the injury-ravaged Magic. Goga Bitadze added 19 and Anthony scored five of his 10 in the fourth quarter, as Orlando closed the game on a 22-4 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas, back after missing 13 games with a hamstring strain, came off the bench and led Brooklyn's scoring with 25 points but missed a jump shot as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony admitted that da Silva, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, was supposed to get the ball on the play that yielded his game winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When that failed to pan out, he said, "I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go get a layup".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nets were without veteran Dorian Finney-Smith, who was traded along with Shake Milton to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a deal that sent D'Angelo Russell back to Brooklyn. (AFP)

    Eagles clinch NFC East title with rout of Dallas

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East division title after handing the Dallas Cowboys a humiliating 41-7 defeat, while the Buffalo Bills secured the second seed in the AFC with a 40-14 crushing of the New York Jets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cowboys were already eliminated from playoff contention and without top receiver CeeDee Lamb with a shoulder injury, but it was their defence that struggled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles starting quarter-back Jalen Hurts missed the game due to concussion. Kenny Pickett got the start but had to leave the game in the third quarter with a rib injury with Philadelphia 24-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant third-choice Tanner McKee took over under the centre and two of his four passes were for touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real damage to the Cowboys, who gave up four turnovers, was done by the Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley who put up 167 yards on 31 carries to pass the 2,000 yard mark for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, who has 2,005 yards needs to put up 101 yards next week to break Eric Dickerson's record for the most rushing yards in a season, set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it," Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means the Eagles are guaranteed at least the number two seed in the NFC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bills took the second seed in the AFC behind defending champions Kansas City Chiefs, after taking care of business against the New York Jets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills led 12-0 at the half before their quarterback Josh Allen took total control of the game with touchdown passes to Amari Cooper and Keon Coleman either side of a rushing score from James Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who threw for 182 yards, had opened the scoring with a one-yard rush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw two interceptions and was sacked four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying," he added. "But it had no effect on us.” (AFP/AP)

    Liverpool crush West Ham; Forest climb to second

<img alt="Liverpool's Diogo Jota celebrates scoring the side's fifth goal with Harvey Elliott and Mohamed Salah. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785405_1_20241230050629.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rampant Liverpool smashed West Ham 5-0 on Sunday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points as Manchester City returned to winning ways at troubled Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to second in the table with a fifth straight win at Everton, while Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham conceded late to draw 2-2 against Vitor Pereira's rejuvenated Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's Liverpool look unstoppable in their quest for a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title, recording their 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz opened the scoring against Julen Lopetegui's hapless team on the half-hour, before Mohamed Salah set up Cody Gakpo for the second with some audacious footwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egypt international then scored his 20th goal of the season shortly before half-time to put the visitors in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 4-0 with a deflected shot from distance in the 54th minute and Diogo Jota completed the rout, courtesy of another Salah assist following a surging run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy," said Slot, flying in his first season in the Anfield hotseat after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's striking success has come against the background of mounting speculation over the futures of Salah, Alexander-Arnold and captain Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three can discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer from January 1 but remain focused on winning a second Premier League title together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only thing on my mind is I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of that," Salah told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best for the team to win the trophy. There are a few other teams catching up with us and we need to stay focused and humble."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, defending champions City travelled to relegation-threatened Leicester drained of confidence after just one win in all competitions since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their frailties over the past two months, which resulted in nine defeats in their previous 13 games, were on display again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Savinho's first-half goal and an Erling Haaland header after the break made it 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's bid for a fifth straight title looks to be over as they are 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result lifts them to fifth in the table and within striking distance of fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our mood is in a better position. It was tight in the second half, they were much better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the new year can help us bounce back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest beat Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park, leapfrogging Chelsea and Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood chipped over Jordan Pickford for the opening goal in the 15th minute after being set up by Anthony Elanga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wood turned provider for Forest's second, which came just after the hour mark when Morgan Gibbs-White produced some neat footwork before firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Spurs were on track to end a torrid December on a high after first-half goals by Rodrigo Bentancur and Brennan Johnson cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan's brilliant opener for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham captain Son Heung-min also squandered a 43rd-minute penalty, but it did not appear to be too costly until substitute Jorgen Strand Larsen smashed home in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the person in charge, so of course it hurts," said Postecoglou, whose team have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I see how hard they are trying, it hurts even more because you want them to get a reward and I think today they deserved a reward for their efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace won just their second home league game of the season, seeing off bottom club Southampton 2-1, thanks to goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Eberechi Eze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara scored an 89th-minute leveller as Bournemouth drew 2-2 at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea and Manchester United are in action on Monday, with Arsenal travelling to Brentford on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Australia's Nathan Lyon bats on day four of the fourth cricket Test match between Australia and India in Melbourne. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785372_1_20241229164710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Marnus Labuschagne half-century and stubborn tail-end batting drove Australia to a 333-run lead at the end of day four in the fourth test in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving India facing a record chase to steal victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland marched off to a big ovation from home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having combined for an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket as Australia went to stumps at 228 for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon was 41 not out, with number 11 Boland on 10 and India's hopes of winning badly diminished in the final hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the five-test series level at 1-1, India's pace dynamo Jasprit Bumrah threatened to turn the match with a three-wicket burst before tea in front of 43,867 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But number three Labuschagne (70) and his captain Pat Cummins (41) steadied Australia with a 57-run partnership before Boland and Lyon frustrated India further.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day ended sourly for the tourists when Bumrah had Lyon caught in the slips by a juggling KL Rahul in the final over -- with a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only one team has chased more than 300 for victory in an MCG test; England mowed down 332 to beat Australia in 1928.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Boland and Lyon made the going look easy, Labuschagne said there was enough in the pitch for Australia's bowlers on day five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement (off the seam) has probably been the same but just the amount of bounce is significantly lower," Labuschagne told reporters of the changing wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that makes for pretty tricky batting because more balls are hitting the stumps from a shorter length."
  <br>
  <br>
  As impressive as Australia's rearguard resistance was, it followed some shoddy middle order batting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having been in command at 80 for two, Australia crumbled in a Bumrah-led onslaught to slump to 91 for six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammed Siraj triggered the collapse when Steve Smith chased a wide, full delivery and nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to be out for 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah had Travis Head caught at square leg for one to earn his 200th test wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck again four balls later to remove number six Mitchell Marsh for a duck with a gloved catch to Pant before bowling Alex Carey through bat and pad for two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia were wobbling but Cummins rode out the storm with typical defiance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored 49 in the first innings, he produced a vital 41 to stall India's momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Labuschagne was out lbw to Siraj, Cummins added another 25 runs with Mitchell Starc (five) and Lyon before falling to the spin of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fielding mishaps also cost India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped two chances, with Labuschagne spared at 46 when he nicked Akash Deep to the gully and opener Usman Khawaja reprieved on two with a spill at leg gully.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khawaja went on to make 21 before Siraj bowled him in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitish Kumar Reddy also missed a tough chance to remove Cummins for nine, misjudging the flight of the ball when chasing the Aussie skipper's slog over mid-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  India may still count themselves blessed to be in the game at all. They were on the ropes on day three until Reddy rescued them with a maiden century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder finished with 114, his 189-ball vigil ended by spinner Lyon a few overs into the fourth morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me, I think everyone is capable of playing on this pitch," the 21-year-old told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll come back strong in the batting order."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown delivered a 44-point gem as the NBA champion Boston Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak with a 142-105 blowout of the Indiana Pacers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brown set the tone with 15 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics out-scored the Pacers 39-22 to take control.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished with six of the Celtics' 23 three-pointers and came up with four steals, posting his highest scoring output since he scored 50 in a win over Orlando in January 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was big-time," Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Brown, who energised the TD Garden crowd with an array of thunderous dunks. "He has the ability to impact a team and an arena with his energy and his physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he gets into a certain zone he just gets locked in, and you kind of saw that on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 22 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Payton Pritchard added 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists off the bench for the Celtics, who shrugged off the absence of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday to post their biggest points total of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Bennedict Mathurin scored 18 for the Pacers, who were without injured Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lopsided win over the team they vanquished in last season's Eastern Conference finals saw the Celtics avoid their first three-game skid of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also kept them in touch with Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who improved their league-best record to 27-4 with a 149-135 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to lead six Cavaliers players in double figures as Cleveland won their sixth straight – and their 10th in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs drilled 23 three-pointers and led by as many as 21, withstanding a triple-double of 27 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Houston, where Minnesota's Anthony Edwards drilled a step-back three-pointer with 23.2 seconds remaining to lift the Timberwolves to a 113-112 victory over the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet had a chance to win it for Houston, but missed a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 27 points and Edwards finished with 24 for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 16 points, 106-90, with 4:57 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made it happen!" Edwards said. "Got some stops, we made some big shots – made a big shot at the end right there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 38 points and 12 rebounds. Amen Thompson added 20 points as all five Houston starters scored in double figures only to come up short at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks pushed their winning streak to six games with a convincing 108-85 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 26 points and handed out nine assists and Josh Hart added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who made just four of their 15 three-point attempts but converted 24 of their 34 free-throw attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic, with top contributors Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner on the injured list, were led by 27 points from Jalen Suggs.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama delivered 19 points and seven rebounds as the Spurs heated up in the second half to beat the Nets 96-87 in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs connected on just 11 of their 40 shot attempts in the first half and were tied 41-41 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They broke it open in the third quarter, connecting on 13 of their 18 shots. Wembanyama made four of his five attempts in the period, including three three-pointers, as the Spurs seized a 74-62 lead going into the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Reddy's defiant maiden ton claws India back into Test

<img alt="Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrates after passing 100 on day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785295_1_20241228154625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nitish Kumar Reddy scored a defiant maiden century on Saturday as India fought back to reach 358-9 on a rain-hit third day of the fourth Test against Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rising all-rounder Reddy was applauded off the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 105 not out after rain ended play for the day midway through the final session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having provided much-needed stability to another shaky Indian batting effort, the 21-year-old will resume on Sunday alongside Mohammed Siraj, on two, with the first-innings deficit reduced to 116 runs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's push for a much bigger advantage after scoring 474 was stymied by Reddy and spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar, who scored 50 as the pair put on 127 for the eighth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the roar of a large contingent of Indian supporters among a record 83,073 third-day crowd at the MCG, Reddy lofted Scott Boland over mid-on to reach three figures just before play was halted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an innings memorable for resolute defence, mixed with classical strokeplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reddy faced 176 balls, hitting 10 fours and one six, continuing the fine batting form that has marked his debut series.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first six Test innings, he has scored 284 runs at an average of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Pat Cummins with 3-86 were the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered little assistance despite overcast skies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recalled Sundar's dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at first slip by Steve Smith from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended a partnership that traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from 164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sundar survived the most freakish moment of the day when on 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempting to flick a leg-sided delivery from Mitchell Starc, the ball flew from the back of the bat into the slip cordon where a diving Smith spilled a one-handed opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the opening session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pant's innings of 28 ended when he over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, top-edging the ball to third man where Lyon held the catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 83,073 was a record for the third day of a Boxing Day Test, according to Cricket Australia, and the largest day three crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1937.
  <br>
  <br>
  The record total attendance for a Boxing Day Test is 271,865, which looks certain to be smashed on Sunday after 255,462 spectators came through the gates on the first three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain threatened throughout the day and about 40 minutes of play was lost in a period either side of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The series is locked at 1-1 with the fifth and final Test to be played in Sydney next week. (AFP)

    Arsenal edge Ipswich to go second in Premier League

<img alt="Kai Havertz got the only goal but should have had two as Arsenal moved up to second. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785293_1_20241228143656.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal began life without Bukayo Saka by beating Ipswich 1-0 to move into second place in the English Premier League and cut Liverpool's lead to six points on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal failed to turn their dominance into a more convincing scoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may ultimately cost Mikel Arteta's men a first league title in more than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool's closest challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka is set to be sidelined for "many weeks" in the words of Gunners' boss Arteta with fears the England international could be out until March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend's 5-1 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta's solution was to start with Gabriel Martinelli in Saka's normal role wide right with Gabriel Jesus continuing up front after scoring five times in Arsenal's previous two outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were dominant in possession but had few clear-cut chances to show for it until the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were frustrated by Everton in a 0-0 draw in their last league game at the Emirates so there was relief when Havertz broke the deadlock on 23 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German prodded high into the net from Leandro Trossard's low cross for his 12th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus did find the net once more with a cheeky finish between the legs of Arijanet Muric from an almost impossible angle, but was flagged offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces has been well-documented and they should have added to their goals from corners this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes headed against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it seemed easier to score.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Ipswich's ambition grew as the second half wore on, so the chances at the other end began to flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard had given the home crowd a scare by going down holding the left ankle that saw him sidelined by injury for two months earlier in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arsenal captain, though, was quickly back on his feet and weaving his way through the Ipswich defence with a mazy run and powerful strike that Muric tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the resulting corner, Declan Rice's powerful shot was blocked by Dara O'Shea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz then wasted a glorious chance for his second and Muric saved once more from Mikel Merino to ensure a nervy ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal held out to leapfrog Nottingham Forest and Chelsea into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich remain second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton missed the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls are now winless in their past six games but they remain two points above their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had the ball in the net early on through Yoane Wissa but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just Brentford's second point away from home all season is enough to edge the Bees ahead of Tottenham into 11th. (AFP)

<img alt="Gao Xinyu (Left) of China shakes hand with Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil after their women's singles match at the 2025 United Cup tennis tournament in Perth, Australia. Photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785270_1_20241228094532.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sacramento Kings have fired their head coach Mike Brown, ESPN reported on Friday, citing sources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kings lost each of a recent five-game home-stand and sit 12th in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN said sources had told them that assistant coach Doug Christie is expected to take over on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sacramento is 13-18 this season, three games behind the last playoff position, and lost 114-113 to the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, blowing a 19-point third quarter lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown was voted the NBA's Coach of the Year in 2023 after ending the Kings' 16-year absence from the playoffs. He was handed a three-year contract extension in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 54-year-old has previously coached the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Los Angeles Lakers and was an assistant coach to Steve Kerr at the Golden State Warriors before joining Sacramento. (AFP)

<img alt="Steve Smith's epic innings ended when he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785235_1_20241227213610.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's fiery pace attack destroyed India's top order on Friday to put them in the driving seat of the fourth Test after they set a daunting first innings target on the back of Steve Smith's 34th Test century.
 <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 164-5 at the close on day two at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, still 310 runs adrift after Australia were out for 474 soon after lunch on the back of Smith's stylish 140.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rishabh Pant was not out six and Ravindra Jadeja on four, with three wickets in the final half-hour bursting India's momentum after they were 153-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Boland and Pat Cummins grabbed two wickets each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Rohit Sharma reverted to his usual role as opener after dropping to six in the past two Tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it did nothing to help his woeful recent form and he was out for three, spooning an attempted pull shot off Pat Cummins to Boland at mid-on for a simple catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cummins pounced again to remove the in-form KL Rahul with the last ball before tea, bowling him for 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  But opener Yashasvi Jaiswal stood firm with a high-quality innings, playing well off the front foot and crunching a series of stylish boundaries in his 82.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old, who scored 161 in the first Test at Perth, looked destined for another century but threw his wicket away in a comical mix up with Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaiswal set off for a quick single off Boland but his teammate said no, leaving the youngster stranded, ending a dangerous 102-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli, who was fined 20 percent of his match fee for a day one shoulder charge on Australian debutant Sam Konstas, was caught behind by Alex Carey for 36 off Boland, who then removed nightwatchman Akash Deep without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts resumed on 311-6 after a dominant opening day and plundered another 163 runs, with the composed Smith slamming 13 fours and three sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith padded up again on 68, with Cummins alongside him on eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took 15 off one Deep over before Smith hooked Jasprit Bumrah for six to rub salt in the wounds, with India's body language showing their frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith reached his 34th Test century with a boundary off Nitish Kumar Reddy, which came on the back of a return to form in the last Test in Brisbane where he made 101.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a patient innings from the 35-year-old and moved him alongside four other players on the all-time list of century-makers, including Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only six men have scored more, led by Sachin Tendulkar's 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the landmark out of the way, both men began swinging the bat and Cummins paid the price, caught for a fine 49 by Reddy in the deep off Jadeja to end a 112-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starc was bowled by Jadeja for 15 in the first over after lunch, with Smith following in bizarre fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facing Deep, he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon (13) was the final wicket to fall, lbw to Bumrah who ended with 4-99.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep on Friday pulled out of Australian Open qualifying and a warm-up tournament in Auckland, citing pain in her knee and shoulder.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former world number one, who is working to re-establish herself after a doping ban, was handed a wildcard for qualifying at the first major of the year next month at Melbourne Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also due to play the lead-up Auckland Classic, but the 33-year-old Romanian said on Instagram her 2025 season was on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with my team at length, we agreed it is sensible to delay the start of my season," said Halep, the 2018 Melbourne runner-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will rest up and intend for my next event to be Cluj, where I can't wait to play in front of the amazing Romanian fans," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep was suspended for doping in October 2022 and returned to the sport in March after having her ban reduced from four years to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has denied knowingly doping. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Curtis Jones fired Liverpool seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as the title favourites survived a scare in their 3-1 win against struggling Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side were shocked by Jordan Ayew's early strike at Anfield, but the leaders recovered their composure to equalise just before the interval through Cody Gakpo.
  <br>
  <br>
  England midfielder Jones marked his 100th top-flight appearance with the second goal soon after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's 19th goal this term wrapped up Liverpool's 11th win in their last 13 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We created enough, but because we went 1-0 down it was a game," Liverpool manager Slot said. "Then you saw how good we are and Leicester didn't want to come back into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's comeback lifted them seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who were beaten 2-1 by Fulham earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds, who hold a game in hand on Chelsea, have been beaten just once in 17 league matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have won 22 of their 26 games in all competitions in a remarkable run since Slot arrived from Feyenoord in the close-season to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp led Liverpool to their last Premier League title in 2020 and Slot has them perfectly positioned to emulate that feat in the second half of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also through to the League Cup semi-finals and top of the Champions League, Liverpool, who travel to West Ham for their last match of the year on Sunday, will go into 2025 in contention of an unprecedented quadruple.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Leicester are one point from safety after a third consecutive defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah nearly gave Liverpool the perfect start as his close-range effort smacked the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on a night when Anfield was surrounded by a murky mist, Liverpool's defence was lost in the fog in the sixth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Fulham scored twice in the final 10 minutes to end Chelsea's 12-game unbeaten run in all competitions with a stunning 2-1 Premier League win at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitutes Harry Wilson and Rodrigo Muniz shocked the Blues to secure Fulham's first away win at their west London rivals since 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves second-placed Chelsea still four points adrift of leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand over their nearest challengers, starting with the visit of Leicester later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Fulham up to eighth, level on points with champions Manchester City, and within just one point of fifth-placed Newcastle to further their European ambitions for next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a privilege to give our fans this happiness," said Fulham boss Marco Silva. "The second half reaction was top. It is not a coincidence that we are the team in the Premier League that has got the most goals from players off the bench."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has insisted in recent weeks that his young side are not yet cut out for a title challenge despite their fine form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Silva's men have now taken points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea this month and the Portuguese's changes turned the tide in the visitors' favour. (AFP)

    Man Utd crash at Wolves, Man City held by Everton

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes was sent off as Manchester United crashed to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat at lowly Wolves, while Erling Haaland missed a penalty as crisis-torn Manchester City failed to end their dismal run with a 1-1 draw against Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  United suffered a third successive loss in all competitions to leave new boss Ruben Amorim with five defeats in his 10 games since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes was dismissed two minutes into the second half at Molineux for a second booking after fouling Nélson Semedo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's 10 men cracked in the 58th minute, when Matheus Cunha's corner went straight in as goalkeeper André Onana flapped under pressure from Matt Doherty and Santiago Bueno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hwang Hee-chan compounded Amorim's misery when he tapped in with just seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another bitter blow for United, who endured a humiliating 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth at Old Trafford last weekend after losing 4-3 in the League Cup at Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his team marooned in 14th place – just eight points above the relegation zone – Amorim's woes might not be over, with United facing in-form Newcastle on Monday before travelling to Liverpool in their first game of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so tough to win games in this league with 11 men. With 10 men, it's more difficult," Amorim said. "Of course, when you lose, when we don't win, it's a step back – it was really hard with the sending off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three thanks to their second successive win under new manager Vitor Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, campions Manchester City have just one victory in their last 13 games in all competitions as their Christmas schedule started in disappointing fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernardo Silva put City in front early on before Iliman Ndiaye salvaged a point for Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven minutes into the second half, Haaland had the chance to end his longest goal drought at the Etihad but Jordan Pickford dived low to his right to make the save.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are languishing in seventh place and sit five points adrift of the top four, with their astonishing decline showing no sign of ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we need results and we didn't get it. The team played really good again in all departments and unfortunately could not win," said City boss Pep Guardiola, whose side are at risk of failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We accept it," Guardiola added. "It is life. We did not expect it to not win games many times – but what do you have to do? Continue." (AFP)

 Two sailors have died in separate incidents in the treacherous Sydney to Hobart bluewater classic, organisers said Friday, while race favourite Comanche was forced to retire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both crew members, on Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline, were hit by booms as the yachts were making their way south along the New South Wales coast after setting off from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other crew tried to revive them, but were unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage," the race committee said in a brief statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gale-force winds and high seas had been forecast for the 628-nautical mile event, which ends in the Tasmanian state capital Hobart after the fleet tackles the notorious Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weather is a critical factor in the race, first held in 1945, with winds and conditions often changing rapidly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six men died, five boats sank and 55 sailors were rescued in 1998, when a deep depression exploded over the fleet in the Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far seven yachts have pulled out from the initial fleet of 104, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was one of the first casualties, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major setback, race record holder Comanche is also out with mainsail damage, leaving the door open for its main supermaxi rival LawConnect to win line honours for the second straight year. (AFP)

    Australia's top order fires to take charge of 4th Test

<img alt="19-year-old Sam Konstas brings the crowd at the MCC alive with a ramp shot. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785087_1_20241226212400.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's top four all slammed 50 or better on Thursday to take a firm grip on day one of the fourth Test against India, with fearless teenage opener Sam Konstas stealing the show.
 <br>
  <br>
  Batting after captain Pat Cummins won the toss on a steamy day, the hosts reached 311-6 by the close in front of more than 87,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were aided by some inconsistent early bowling and a flying start from Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old blasted a hugely entertaining 60 off 65 balls in a debut to remember, pounding 18 off one Jasprit Bumrah over and having a run-in with superstar Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the close, Steve Smith was not out 68 and Pat Cummins was eight. Marnus Labuschagne made 72 and Usman Khawaja 57.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the bowlers were punished but they rallied with four wickets in the final session, including dangerman Travis Head for a duck, to haul themselves back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah led the charge, ending with 3-75.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite surreal with the big crowd, the biggest crowd I've ever played before," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just played with freedom and backed myself. Lucky to get a few runs. A bit disappointed with the way I got out but hopefully we have got a bit of momentum for tomorrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of credit to the way Sam played. The intent he showed sort of put us on the back foot," said Indian batting coach Abhishek Nayar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it took a lot of character for our bowlers to stick in there. It wasn't the easiest conditions to bowl. At times like that it is important to stick to your plans and post-lunch we came back really strong."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Konstas in for the axed Nathan McSweeney, he and Khawaja shared an 89-run opening partnership – the hosts' best of the series – before the teenager was undone by the spin of Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's youngest-ever opener faced the first over from a menacing Bumrah and survived despite the Indian spearhead repeatedly beating his bat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konstas said before the match he had a plan to combat Bumrah, and as he got his eye in he incredibly reverse ramped him for two fours and a six in one over, bringing the crowd alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  A frustrated Kohli forcefully bumped shoulders with him at one point and they exchanged words, which could see both players in trouble if the match referee takes the matter further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just doing my gloves and I think he accidentally bumped me. But that's just cricket, the tension," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was unfazed and slammed 18 off the next Bumrah over, including another six.
  <br>
  <br>
  His half-century came off just 52 balls – the third-fastest on debut for Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end Khawaja, twice the age of his opening partner, was content to be the support act, grinding his way to a 27th Test 50 in a welcome return to form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah finally removed him after a 121-ball stay with Khawaja's pull shot going only as far as KL Rahul at midwicket, leaving Labuschagne and Smith to see them to tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith survived three lbw appeals from Akash Deep when they returned before India finally earned a reward when spinner Washington Sundar, in the side for Shubman Gill, tempted Labuschagne into a drive that was collected by Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dangerous Head marched to the crease after plundering centuries in both Adelaide and Brisbane but only lasted seven balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah did the damage, with the Australian leaving a delivery that clattered into his off stump, before the Indian star accounted for Mitchell Marsh (4) and Alex Carey (31) fell to Deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith kept plugging away to reach a 42nd Test 50 as he targets a second century of the series. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The crews of more than 100 yachts set sail on Thursday on a "boat-breaking" Sydney-Hobart yacht race, with gale-force winds and high seas forecast for the gruelling bluewater classic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under blue, mid-summer skies, spectators crowded onto boats and lined the shore of a breezy Sydney Harbour as a starting cannon set the fleet on a dash to the open ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a dramatic opening contest, reigning line honours champion LawConnect lost an early lead when one of her sails failed to unfurl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comanche, four-time line honours champion and the event's record holder, took over as frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late evening, Comanche was speeding southwards down Australia's east coast with a lead of more than eight nautical miles over LawConnect.
  <br>
  <br>
  LawConnect edged Comanche to win by just 51 seconds last year and the two 100-foot supermaxis are again expected to battle for line honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was the first casualty of this year's race, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 104 entrants at the start of the race, 102 remain after the withdrawals of Alive and the two-handed Transcendence Rudy Project, which dismasted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Race crews face gales, storms and big waves as they sail south and then tackle the notorious Bass Strait towards the Tasmanian state capital Hobart.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James and Steph Curry served up a Christmas Day feast as their rivalry delivered another classic with the Los Angeles Lakers edging the Golden State Warriors 115-113 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry made a stunning 31-foot three-point throw with 7.1 seconds left on the clock to tie the game, only for Austin Reaves to win the game for the Lakers with a driving layup with 1.1 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old Curry and James, three years his senior, had traded three-pointers down the stretch as fans were treated to a ding-dong finale from the two future Hall of Famers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James put up 31 points and ten assists without the support of teammate Anthony Davis, who left the game in the first quarter after turning his ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game-winner Reaves enjoyed a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's 38 points included 8-15 three-point shooting while Anthony Wiggins made 21 points and 12 rebounds, but Golden State fell to an 11th loss in 14 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is the day of giving, and that's what me and Steph continue to do and try to do for our fans, for our beautiful game," said James.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how many times we're going to be able to have this matchup. We try to give the game what it deserves, because it's given us so much, we try to give it right back," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was playing in a record 19th Christmas Day game and took the occasion to take a gentle swipe at the NFL's encroachment on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the NFL but Christmas is our day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Bridges and the New York Knicks edged Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs 117-114 in a thriller at Madison Square Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  French star Wembanyama put up 42 points with 18 rebounds and four blocks for the Spurs but Bridges took the glory with a brilliant 15-point fourth-quarter display that left him with a season-high 41 points and the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old, who stands 7-foot-3 (2.21m), was 16-31 on shooting and made six of 16 three-point throws and while Bridges took the applause from the home crowd, he was quick to praise the Frenchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From 40 feet out, from right under the rim, from 15 feet out, he's just unbelievable, just to see what he's doing, credit to him and how much work he has put in," said Bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Bridges, who was traded from the Brooklyn Nets in July, shot 17-25 from the field and was six for nine on three-point attempts as his team improved to 20-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio were just a point behind with two minutes remaining before Bridges made back-to-back jumpers to open up a five-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns with 21 points and Jalen Brunson with 20 points and nine assists were crucial for the Knicks in the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions the Boston Celtics (22-8) lost back-to-back games for the first time this season when they were upset at home by the Philadelphia 76ers 118-114.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-prone 76ers star Joel Embiid hurt his ankle in a pre-game fall but was able to start and showed his importance with 27 points, nine rebounds and the game-clinching free throws at the end to clinch the win for the 11-17 Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyres Maxey scored 33 points and made 12 assists with his 13 points in the fourth quarter crucial as Philadelphia, who had led by 16 at the break, recovered from Boston's third quarter rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum top-scored for the Celtics with 32 points and also grabbed 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a Merry Christmas for the Dallas Mavericks who lost their Slovenian star Luka Doncic with a calf injury in the second quarter of their 105-99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who had scored 14 points, limped out of the game and did not return. The Mavericks did manage a brave comeback attempt without him, before falling short.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards put up 26 points for Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Timberwolves led 57-40 at the half and extended that advantage to 28-points before Dallas, led by Kyrie Irving who made 39 points, started to work their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was close at the end but Irving missed a three-point shot that would have given Dallas the lead in the last minute and a two-foot shot from Edwards and a pair of free throws from Julius Randle made sure of the win. (AFP)

    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

    Judd Trump 'much happier' playing as HK resident

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in a major tournament at Kai Tak next March as a Hong Kong resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in 35 years, the SAR will stage a ranking event as the World Snooker Tour announced earlier that the World Grand Prix will take place at the brand new Kai Tak Sports Park between March 4 and 9, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who just obtained a Hong Kong passport through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

    Djokovic eyes more Slam glory as Swiatek returns

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic is confident he can still win Grand Slams, starting at the Australian Open, with the Serbian kickstarting his bid for an unprecedented 11th title and record 25th major crown in Brisbane this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who is gunning for a third Melbourne Park trophy, joins him at the Queensland Tennis Centre from December 29-January 5 in a stellar women's field.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 season gets under way on Friday with the mixed-teams United Cup in Perth and Sydney, headlined by world number two Iga Swiatek in her first tournament since revelations that she served a one-month doping suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first season since 37-year-old Djokovic began playing that none of the other so-called "Big Four" will be on the other side of the net following the retirements this year of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they faded, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz stepped up to become the new Grand Slam kings, with both men opting against a warm-up tournament leading into the first major of the year which begins on January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  As doubts grew over Djokovic's motivation and ability to take down the new guard after a disappointing 2024, he stunned the tennis world by hiring Murray to coach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resurgent Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune, and Frances Tiafoe are also playing in Brisbane, as is Australian Nick Kyrgios, who returns after injuries restricted him to just one ATP Tour singles match in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenging Sabalenka on Pat Rafter Arena will be America's top talents Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seven and eight respectively, along with former world number two Ons Jabeur and veteran Victoria Azarenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, who beat China's high-flying Zheng Qinwen in the Melbourne final this year, had a sensational 2024 which culminated in being named WTA Player of Year this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has capped off a historic 2024 by winning The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the third time, tying him with basketball great Michael Jordan. He trails only four-time winners Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods and LeBron James.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very honoured,” Ohtani said through translator Matt Hidaka. ”Obviously all the hard work has paid off. Maybe next year, I’ll get the award again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In balloting by 74 sports journalists from the AP and its members, Ohtani received 48 votes. He previously won the award in 2023 and 2021, when he was with the Los Angeles Angels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Japan, I did follow Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods,” he said. “I would see their accolades and how they were successful in the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP honour has been given out since 1931. Golfer Babe Didrikson won six times, the most by a man or woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimmer Léon Marchand of France, who won four gold medals at the Paris Olympics, was second with 10 votes in balloting announced Monday. Golfer Scottie Scheffler, whose victories this year included the Masters and an Olympic gold medal, was third with nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP Female Athlete of the Year will be announced on Wednesday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka will be sidelined for "many weeks" after suffering a hamstring injury in Arsenal's 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, with manager Mikel Arteta describing his loss as a "huge" blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The England winger went down midway through the first half at Selhurst Park on Saturday and had to be replaced by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not looking good. He will be out for many weeks," Arteta said at a press conference, adding he could not be more specific.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard said the loss of the 23-year-old, who has nine goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season, would force him into a rethink.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously he's a big player for us," he said. "You just have to see the impact that he has on the team, but it's going to be a really good exercise for all of us to think about ways to overcome another challenge – because we've already had a lot in the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said Saka was "gutted" and "really emotional" after discovering the extent of his injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that fellow winger Raheem Sterling had injured his knee and would be out for a number of weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to look internally at what we have and be creative," said the Gunners boss, adding that he did not know if the club would sign a winger in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was filmed leaving Selhurst Park on crutches, souring what had been a comprehensive second win over the Palace in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta, whose third-placed team face Premier League strugglers Ipswich on Saturday, said he was confident that Saka would be back well before the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the development of a player," Arteta said. "At some stage, at this level, you are going to get injured – unfortunately badly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could have been worse, it could have been something else that can take you out for a year," he added. "It's how you react to that, how you overcome that situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said he was "putting some ideas together" about how to cope in the winger's absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the congested fixture schedule had played a part in Saka's injury, Arteta said the issue was more to do with consistently high workloads over many seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, Bukayo and Declan (Rice), they played over 130 games in two seasons," he said. "So what's going to happen in the second one, the third one or the fourth one, if that continues the same way? It's unsustainable." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 England Test captain Ben Stokes faces at least three months out after tearing his left hamstring during the tour of New Zealand, team management announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder had already been ruled out of next year's Champions Trophy one-day international tournament in Pakistan and the preceding white-ball tour of India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further assessments have since revealed the full extent of the injury, with Stokes set to undergo surgery in January, said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes suffered the injury while bowling during the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes did not bat in the second innings of that match as England slumped to a 423-run defeat – a result that meant his side still won a three-match series 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  He previously missed this year's home series against Sri Lanka and the first Test in Pakistan after tearing the hamstring on the same left leg in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  England's next Test is at home to Zimbabwe in May. They will then host a five-match Test series against India starting in June, before their pinnacle 2025 to 2026 Ashes tour of Australia. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokić shook off a slow start to post a 27-point triple-double as the Nuggets rallied to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 132-129 in overtime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jokić, who claimed his third MVP in four years last season, added 13 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb star, who was held to six points in the first half, bemoaned another slow start for Denver – who trailed by as many as 17 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took a 111-109 lead on Julian Strawther's layup with just over four minutes left in regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  CJ McCollum put New Orleans back in front 119-117 with 53.2 seconds left in the fourth, but Denver guard Jamal Murray drilled a step-back basket with nine seconds to go to tie it at 119-119, and when McCollum missed a three-pointer they went to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokić took over in the extra session, scoring Denver's first six points as they handed the Pelicans a seventh straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seems like we just like it that way," Jokić said of the late heroics needed by the Nuggets. "But we should be more hungry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray also scored 27 points for Denver, and Russell Westbrook added 21 off the bench. Jordan Hawkins led New Orleans' scoring with 25 points and McCollum had 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers posted their fourth straight win in impressive style, powering away in the second half to beat the Kings 122-95 in Sacramento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam delivered a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds and the Pacers put up 70 points in the second half of a dominant victory in which seven Indiana players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Turner scored 15 points, star guard Tyrese Haliburton and reserve Ben Sheppard added 14 apiece and T.J. McConnell contributed 12 points and 10 assists off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We brought it from start to finish," Sheppard said. "The energy we brought, both the bench and the starters – it was a great team win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Point guard De'Aaron Fox scored 23 points to lead the Kings, and Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 21 rebounds – but Kings fans were booing as the team fell to a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough night for us," Kings coach Mike Brown said. "There are going to be nights when you don't have it offensively, but we can't give up 70 points in a half." (AFP)

<img alt="Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels celebrates with teammate Olamide Zaccheaus (14). Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784627_1_20241223080808.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw five touchdown passes on Sunday as the Commanders halted Philadelphia's 10-game NFL winning streak with a 36-33 victory in which the Eagles also lost quarterback Jalen Hurts to a concussion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders piled up 22 points in the fourth quarter, rookie signal-caller Daniels finding Jamison Crowder with a nine-yard touchdown pass with six seconds left to secure what had seemed an unlikely win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game's never over until the clock hits zero," Daniels said after a win that kept the Commanders' playoff hopes alive while eliminating Dallas and San Francisco from contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels awesome," Daniels added. "Everybody can enjoy their Christmas now."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You got those guys that came in on the win streak they were on, they were hot and they’re a very good team," he went on to say. "And rightfully so, good offense, good defence, all-around well-prepared team and you want to go out there and see where you match up against those type of guys."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles, who hadn't lost since September, were without Hurts for most of the game after he hit his head on the turf after a tackle in the first quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Pickett replaced him and threw for 143 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but at 12-3 the Eagles dropped out of a tie for best record in the NFC and failed to clinch the NFC East division title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions remained atop the NFC with a franchise-record 13th victory, cruising past the Bears 34-17 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stung by a loss to Buffalo that snapped their 11-game winning streak, the Lions jumped to a 20-point lead on the way to setting a single-season franchise record for points scored with 493 so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lios quarterback Jared Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, including an 82-yard TD pass to Jameson Williams, who had a career-high 143 receiving yards on five catches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, as the Lions used a trick play in which Goff pretended to stumble to spring tight end Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive of the second half. (AFP/AP)

    Mbappé strikes as Real Madrid down Sevilla

<img alt="Mbappé opened the scoring for Real Madrid, who recorded their twelfth straight victory in all competitions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784625_1_20241223074531.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé scored a screamer and set up another goal as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 4-2 on Sunday to move second in La Liga above stuttering rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Atlético Madrid beat Barca on Saturday to claim top spot at Christmas, Carlo Ancelotti's side also took advantage with a comfortable home win which leaves them a point behind the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Ancelotti said ahead of Sevilla's visit that Mbappé's adaptation period had ended following his summer switch from Paris Saint-Germain and the French forward proved the coach right with a strong performance and his 14th goal of the season across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fede Valverde also netted a brilliant effort from range, with Rodrygo Goes and Brahim Diaz on the scoresheet for the hosts too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio scored for Sevilla, although they were thoroughly outplayed on veteran defender Jesus Navas' final game for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that we know each other better, my arrival changed a lot of things, and now, as the coach said, the adaptation is over and I feel very good in the team," Mbappé said. "We can see on the pitch that I click better with my team-mates and now we're all playing better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé, back after a brief absence with a thigh injury, scored for Madrid in midweek as they won the Intercontinental Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was welcome relief for the forward after missing two penalties in recent weeks against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, as well as suffering criticism for his form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I've got much more in my legs than I'm showing, but in the last games I've played better," Mbappé added. "The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom, I missed a penalty and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinícius Júnior suspended, Mbappé took the reins and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as Madrid brought the ball out from the back and worked it to Rodrygo on the left flank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian squared to Mbappé on the edge of the area, who took one touch to control, another to set himself and with his third, smashed a fierce effort past the helpless Álvaro Fernández.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's second, 10 minutes later, was even better, with Valverde firing a screamer into the top corner from over 30 yards out after a short corner routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti's side were in full flow and the third followed in the 34th minute when Lucas Vázquez crossed for Rodrygo, who finished with aplomb. (AFP)

    Brazil's Fonseca captures Next Gen ATP Finals crown

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joao Fonseca became the second youngest champion of the NextGen ATP tournament on Sunday when he defied his lowly ranking of 145 to defeat Learner Tien in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Fonseca, 18, came through 2-4, 4-3 (10/8), 4-0, 4-2 to see off his left-handed American opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the youngest champion at the event since current world number one Jannik Sinner claimed the title also at the age of 18 five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult," Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with tennis legend Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a final against Learner in juniors at the 2023 US Open and I know the way he can play," he added. "He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca, the lowest-ranked player in the eight-man field, won all five matches he played this week at the Red Sea venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began the year ranked at 730 in the world and having made a maiden ATP quarter-final in Rio this year, he will be aiming to make significant progress in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to believe when I go before a tournament that I can win," Fonseca said. "But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself." (AFP)

<img alt="Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring their fifth goal. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784620_1_20241223062113.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool swept four points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah's masterclass inspired a memorable 6-3 rout of Tottenham, while Manchester United crashed to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah delivered a sublime performance featuring two goals and a pair of assists as Arne Slot's side ran riot in north London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old is now Liverpool's fourth top scorer ever with 229 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's brace took him past Billy Liddell, with only Ian Rush (346), Roger Hunt (285) and Gordon Hodgson (241) ahead of him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds have won 21 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Slot and have a game in hand on Chelsea to strengthen their lead in the title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a remarkable display of Liverpool's firepower as Luis Díaz and Alexis Mac Allister scored to put them in command.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 60 minutes we did everything we had to do, we were comfortable and good with the ball – the main thing is we worked very hard," Slot said. "But you have to be on top of your game for the whole game and we didn't do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke scored for Tottenham, but an eighth league defeat this season leaves them languishing in 11th place as the pressure mounts on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you want to discount the fact we're missing a goalkeeper, two centre-backs and a left-back and that hasn't coincided with how we're doing – I don't know what to say anymore," Postecoglou said of his critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim, who once again left Marcus Rashford out of his squad, is set for a miserable Christmas following the worst result of his brief reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Languishing in 13th place, United have suffered four defeats in nine matches in all competitions since Amorim arrived from Sporting Lisbon in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's second successive loss after their League Cup exit at Tottenham on Thursday underlined Amorim's belief that their road back to the top will be long and arduous.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who have conceded first in their last six games, were booed off at half-time, while the final whistle was greeted by more jeers from the few fans who stayed until the bitter end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous – I felt it in the stadium," Amorim said. "We have to suffer again, but we will try to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's decision to play without Rashford for the third consecutive game will face fresh scrutiny after United's wretched performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim surprisingly omitted the 27-year-old England forward from the squad for United's win at Manchester City last weekend, prompting Rashford to hint he was willing to leave the club for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford was at Old Trafford wearing a United tracksuit amid his extended exile, as Amorim made six changes from the line-up beaten 4-3 by Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. (AFP)

 Chinese world number five Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the season-opening United Cup on Sunday citing the need for more rest, but plans to be at the Australian Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old is coming off a breakthrough season that reaped three singles titles, with the highlight winning Olympic gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also made her first Grand Slam final, at Melbourne Park, losing in straight sets to current world number one Aryna Sabalenka on the back of playing the mixed-teams United Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng has opted for more rest this time ahead of the season-opening major from January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the long season that 2024 was for me, I need a few extra weeks of rest, recovery, and good training to get ready for the new season," she wrote on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had such a fantastic time at the United Cup in January of this year, and therefore will miss the event greatly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still, I'm so excited to be back in Australia soon and I will see you all in Melbourne in a couple of weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  China begin their United Cup campaign against Brazil in Perth on Friday, leaving world No.175 Gao Xinyu as their top-ranked woman. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk won his heavyweight championship rematch against Tyson Fury by unanimous decision on Saturday to stay unbeaten across two divisions and underline his right to be counted as one of the all-time greats.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian, who forced the pace and repeatedly tagged Fury with his accurate left hook, was awarded the fight 116-112 by all three judges, handing Fury his second straight loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usyk's win takes him to 23-0 with 14 knockouts and extends one of the all-time best careers that includes Olympic gold and undisputed champion at cruiserweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great fighter, it's a great performance," Usyk, 37, said of Fury, who was unbeaten over 35 fights until he lost their four-belt unification bout in May. "Unbelievable 24 rounds for my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the WBA, WBO and WBC belts were on the line this time after Usyk, focused on the lucrative rematch, relinquished his IBF title rather than face challenger Daniel Dubois.
  <br>
  <br>
  By beating Fury seven months ago, "The Cat" had already joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight, and the first of the four-belt era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat opens up an uncertain future for the 36-year-old Fury, now 34-2-1, who announced his retirement in 2022 only to change his mind and return to the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury, wearing a Santa-style red-and-white robe and bushy beard, appeared to Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You", before a determined-looking Usyk strode out in Cossack gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 6ft 9ins (206cm) Briton's jab held Usyk at bay early on and he landed a jarring right in round two. Usyk caught Fury flush with a left as he raised the pace in round three.
  <br>
  <br>
  They went toe-to-toe in a punishing fifth round, with Fury pummelling body shots while Usyk launched a flurry to the head. In the sixth, he stung Fury with a clean shot to the nose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supremely fit Usyk, renowned for taking charge in the closing rounds, was the aggressor in the seventh, tagging Fury with a hook as the "Gypsy King" backed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury regained the initiative in the ninth, wielding his jab and one-two combinations and leaning on the Ukrainian, utilising his career-heaviest 281lb (127.4kg) of weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was see-saw stuff as they traded blows but Usyk rocked Fury in the 11th with a lightning combination that ended with yet another left hook to the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Usyk uppercut to Fury's chin highlighted a furious final round and there was little doubt about the winner as the Ukrainian sank to his knees, arms aloft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports put the prize purse at US$190 million, with Usyk, as defending champion, expected to receive the bigger share -- a reversal of fortunes from May.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight sits high in the portfolio of Saudi Arabia's oil-funded push into sports, which has drawn accusations of "sportswashing" its dubious human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Formula One, the LIV Golf tour, Newcastle United and a swathe of ageing football stars, the kingdom's strategy confirmed its crowning moment this month when it was awarded football's 2034 World Cup. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to their ninth defeat in 12 matches at Aston Villa on Saturday as Arsenal dismantled Crystal Palace 5-1 to reignite their Premier League title charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest stormed Brentford's fortress to briefly climb to third in the table and Alexander Isak scored his first hat-trick in the English top flight as Newcastle ran riot at Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola -- in the worst spell of his managerial career -- made multiple changes following last week's painful derby defeat to Manchester United but it was to no avail as his injury-hit side lost 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season to put Villa ahead in the 16th minute and Morgan Rogers doubled the advantage for the impressive home side in the 65th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden scored his first top-flight goal of the season in stoppage time but it proved too little too late for the flailing champions, whose spark has vanished.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost six Premier League games in the current campaign, twice as many as they suffered during the whole of last season, when they were crowned champions for the fourth time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola said he trusted his players to turn things around despite their shocking run of just one win from their past 12 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys," he told the BBC. "Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bullish Mikel Arteta said Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, are now firmly in the title picture after his team's thumping win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, scored two more against the same opponents and there were also goals for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and substitute Declan Rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third-placed Gunners are just three points behind Liverpool, who are in action at Tottenham on Sunday, but Arne Slot's men have played two games fewer. Chelsea are in second spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one stage earlier this month Liverpool had a yawning nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not even halfway so we're going to try and set something. For us it's on," Arteta told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to enjoy Christmas with my family because when you win it's always better," added the Spaniard, whose side have finished as Premier League runners-up for the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest won their third consecutive Premier League match to keep up their push for European football, condemning Brentford to their first home defeat this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ola Aina slotted home the opener towards the end of the first half and Anthony Elanga made it 2-0 early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's about enjoying the moment," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "It's a very hard competition. Every game is so difficult and the next one is going to be very tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very proud of all the things we've been able to achieve, but we've achieved nothing yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle deepened Ipswich's plight and lifted themselves to seventh in the table with a 4-0 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak volleyed Eddie Howe's team ahead in the first minute and Jacob Murphy doubled Newcastle's lead before Isak side-footed in from close range just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden international scored his third nine minutes into the second half, poking the ball home after more fine work from Murphy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a ninth defeat in 17 games for Ipswich since they returned to the Premier League and they remain in the relegation zone, two points from safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mats Wieffer gave Brighton a 51st-minute lead against West Ham at the London Stadium but Mohammed Kudus equalised seven minutes later and the match finished 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Away from Saturday's action, Premier League basement club Southampton named former Roma and Torino boss Ivan Juric as their new manager, replacing the sacked Russell Martin. (AFP)
