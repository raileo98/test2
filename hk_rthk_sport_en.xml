<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ivan Perisic scored one goal and made another as Croatia beat France 2-0 to seize the upper hand in the first leg of their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Perisic crossed for Ante Budimir to head in the opener at the Stadion Poljud in Split after the home side had squandered an early penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  With France out of sorts, Perisic made it 2-0 before the break and a Croatia side captained by Luka Modric saw out the victory to take to Paris for the return match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not a good night for France as captain Kylian Mbappe made his comeback having not featured in either of the last two international windows, in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappe did have chances, notably seeing a deflected second-half shot from Ousmane Dembele's cutback kept out by a fine Dominik Livakovic save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid superstar has now failed to find the net in his last six appearances for his country, since scoring a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus will now have to find a way of overturning the deficit at the Stade de France on Sunday, otherwise Croatia will be heading to the final four of the Nations League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will take place in June and will be hosted by either Italy or Germany, depending on which of those sides emerges victorious from their last-eight encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won the Nations League in 2021 but suffered a first ever defeat against Croatia in the group stage of the following year's edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest repeat of the 2018 World Cup final, won 4-2 by the French in Moscow, saw Croatia win a spot-kick just five minutes in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate was penalised for a blatant handball inside the area, but Mike Maignan saved Andrej Kramaric's penalty after a long delay due to the goalkeeper having a laser pen shone in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Croatia did get the breakthrough on 26 minutes as Budimir, who has 15 goals in La Liga this season for Osasuna, got in front of William Saliba to connect with a Perisic cross from the left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budimir'e header was blocked by Maignan, but the ball still spun into the net in cruel fashion for the goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 2-0 in first-half stoppage time as Saliba blocked a shot by Martin Baturina, only for the ball to fall for PSV Eindhoven veteran Perisic to fire in.
  <br>
  <br>
  France made changes, sending on Dayot Upamecano for Konate at the restart and later bringing on Bradley Barcola for Randal Kolo Muani and Michael Olise for Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter spent more time on the right flank after the break having previously been deployed more centrally.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they could not get a goal back and now face a daunting task in trying to recover the tie. (AFP)

    NBA's Boston Celtics sold for record US$6.1 billion

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA's Boston Celtics are being sold to the head of a California private equity firm for US$6.1 billion, a record price for a US sports franchise, according to reports by The Boston Globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper, citing a league source, said the Celtics ownership had agreed to sell the iconic team to William Chisholm, managing director and co-founder of Symphony Technology Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US$6.1 billion purchase price is the highest ever offered for a North American sports team, surpassing the US$6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of the Celtics, the current NBA champions, still requires the approval of the NBA Board of Governors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is one of the most storied in the league's history, with a record 18 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, is a longtime fan of the team, according to the Globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the new ownership group also includes current Celtics co-owner Robert Hale; Bruce Beal Jr., president of Related Companies; and the global investment firm, Sixth Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper said three other buyers had been under consideration: Steve Pagliuca, a Celtics co-owner; Stan Middleman, a co-owner of MLB's Philadelphia Phillies; and The Friedkin Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grousbeck family and Pagliuca purchased the Celtics for US$360 million in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three NBA teams were sold in 2023 – the Phoenix Suns for US$4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks for US$3.5 billion and the Dallas Mavericks for US$3.5 billion. (AFP)

<img alt="The two-time Olympic swimming champion succeeds Thomas Bach. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796684_1_20250321001616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry became the first woman and African to be elected president of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday declaring it to be an "extraordinary moment."
 <br>
  <br>
  At 41, the two-time Olympic swimming champion is also the youngest ever elected to be the most powerful person in sports governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  She succeeds Thomas Bach, who steps down after 12 years, and said she would work with the six other heavyweight rivals she beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year-old girl I never thought that I would be standing up here one day, getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours," Coventry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not just a huge honour but it is a reminder to every single one of you that I will lead this organisation with so much pride, with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and, I hope, extremely confident in the decision you've taken today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coventry, who was strongly believed to be Bach's favoured candidate, was thought to be in a tight-run race with IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior and World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, to general surprise, the race was over after the first round of voting a majority of the 100-plus IOC members placing their faith in her to meet the serious challenges that lie ahead. (AFP)

    Japan first team to qualify for 2026 World Cup

<img alt="Daichi Kamada's ninth goal for Japan sends the 60,000-strong crowd wild. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796672_1_20250320214131.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan became the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup after second-half goals from Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo gave them a 2-0 win over Bahrain on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The runaway Asian Group C leaders failed to sparkle on a chilly night in Saitama until Crystal Palace forward Kamada pounced for the opener in the 66th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo added another in the 87th minute as Japan punched their ticket to next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be their eighth straight World Cup appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's 5-1 home win over Indonesia earlier in the evening meant Japan would have clinched their place even with a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kamada made sure they did it in style in front of an expectant crowd of just under 60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He latched onto Kubo's reverse pass and dispatched the ball past Bahrain goalkeeper Ebrahim Lutfalla just three minutes after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Kubo added some extra gloss to the night with a left-footed shot from a tight angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's players sprinted onto the pitch at the final whistle and celebrated with the home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan have been in unstoppable form in the Asian third round of qualifiers and went into the game having won five and drawn one of their games so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Hajime Moriyasu started with an experienced line-up featuring Premier League talent in Liverpool's Wataru Endo and Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Endo thought he had given his team the lead in the ninth minute when he rammed home a loose ball in the box, only for the goal to be disallowed by VAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan continued to press for the opener but Bahrain had several dangerous raids on the counterattack and Komail Al Aswad should have done better just after the half-hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were also wasteful and Mitoma blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy in first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriyasu shuffled his pack midway through the second half, bringing on Kamada and Junya Ito for Takumi Minamino and Ritsu Doan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impact was immediate as Kamada gave Japan the lead with his ninth goal for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo went close to adding another with a curling shot that Lutfalla clawed away with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the attacker got his goal with time running out as Japan made sure of the win, and with it a place in North America. (AFP)

    Legendary F1 team owner Eddie Jordan dies

<img alt="Eddie Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called 'quite aggressive' cancer of the bladder and prostate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796629_1_20250320172623.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

    Doncic in solid-gold show for win over Nuggets

<img alt="Luka Doncic catches Denver Nuggets off guard in making a shot. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796600_1_20250320140326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic raced to the 200th 30-point game of his career as the Los Angeles Lakers took advantage of an under-strength Denver Nuggets line-up to score a 120-108 victory over their Western Conference rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Slovenian star Doncic, once again spearheading the Lakers offence in the absence of the injured LeBron James, rattled in 31 points, with nine rebounds and seven assists as the Lakers cruised to a wire-to-wire win on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets, missing Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, were never in the hunt after Doncic poured in 21 points in the first quarter alone as the Lakers sprinted into an early 46-29 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers maintained a double-digit cushion for most of the remainder of the game, with Austin Reaves adding 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 43-25, leapfrogging Denver (44-26) into third place in the Western Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers in February in a shock trade from Dallas, has now scored 30 points or more in eight of his 16 games with the Lakers following his blockbuster move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, every day gets better," Doncic told ESPN following the win. "That's three wins in a row now so we've got to just keep it going.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We go game-by-game because if you think too far in the future maybe you forget about the next game. We know the (standings) are tight but we've just got to try and win every game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' victory ensured that the Oklahoma City Thunder must wait a little longer before clinching the No 1 seeding from the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could have sealed the top seed with a Lakers loss after dismantling the hapless Philadelphia 76ers 133-100 earlier Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could afford to rest Most Valuable Player front-runner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander but were still far too strong for a Sixers team whose regular season is ending in disarray.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Sixers stars Joel Embiid and Paul George ruled out for the rest of the campaign and Tyrese Maxey missing with a lower back injury, the Thunder coasted to a blowout, wire-to-win after leading by as much as 41 points at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven Oklahoma City players finished in double figures with Aaron Wiggins topping the scoring with 26 points as the Thunder improved to 57-12, 12.5 games clear of the Houston Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Rockets meanwhile remained in second place in the West after rolling to their eighth straight win, a 116-108 victory on the road over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Green led the Houston scorers with 26 points, Alperen Sengun providing offensive support with 22 points, 12 rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland slid to their third straight defeat in a 123-119 loss to the Sacramento Kings in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers fell to 56-13 after 27 points from the Kings DeMar DeRozan -- one of seven Sacramento players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves' bid for a top six finish -- and an automatic playoff berth -- lost further momentum in a 119-115 home defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zion Williamson scored 29 points for New Orleans in what was only their seventh away win of the season. The Pelicans (19-51) are already eliminated from postseason contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was another sizeable upset in New York, where the San Antonio Spurs routed the Knicks 120-105 thanks to a sharp-shooting 34-point performance off the bench from Sandro Mamukelashvili.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old New York-born Georgian centre rattled in a perfect seven-from-seven three-pointers in a blistering 19-minute spell.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio improved to 29-39 with the win to keep alive their faint chances of advancing to the Western Conference play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks are 43-25 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-placed Indiana Pacers meanwhile edged closer to the Knicks after staging a late rally to down the Dallas Mavericks 135-131.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers trailed by 11 points with six minutes remaining but conjured a late charge to snatch victory, with Pascal Siakam finishing on 29 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 23 points -- 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Nick Kyrgios came from behind to defeat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the first round of the Miami Open to earn his first win since October 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kyrgios, who retired from his first-round match at Indian Wells this month due to pain in his surgically repaired right wrist, soaked in the moment on Wednesday, looking skyward and taking a deep breath after sealing the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a long journey even to get to the start line of matches and be scared to even be able to finish them," he told Tennis TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to come in and get a win and feel like I belong again, it's pretty special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrgios, who had lost all three matches he played this year, got off to a slow start on a hot and humid day in South Florida but after dropping the first set, he began to settle in, finding his rhythm on serve to level the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decider, he hit a well-disguised drop shot to set up a break point and converted when his American opponent double-faulted to hand Kyrgios a 4-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  From there he rode his best shot, his booming serve, to the finish line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Kyrgios is Russian Karen Khachanov, who stunned the Australian in a hard-fought quarter-final at the 2022 US Open, a tournament Kyrgios was among the favourites to win that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after that bitter disappointment he would take a lengthy break from the court to tend to a series of knee, foot and wrist problems that threatened to permanently derail the 29-year-old's career before returning to the tour this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Gael Monfils, Belgian David Goffin, and Russian-born Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik were among the players who also advanced out of the first round with wins on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, former US Open champion Emma Raducanu barely broke a sweat as she brushed aside Japanese wild card Sayaka Ishii 6-2 6-1 to reach the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu, who was ousted in the first round at Indian Wells, regained her footing against Ishii as she won 77 percent of her first-serve points, fired down six aces and converted five of her six break point chances in the 65-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Britain's Raducanu will be American world number 10 Emma Navarro, who won a WTA 500 event in Mexico in early March for her second career title before losing in the third round at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other women's action Belinda Bencic, fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, overcame a 5-3 third-set deficit to beat Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska on Grandstand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss former world number four gave birth to her daughter Bella in April and won her first WTA title as a mother when she triumphed at the WTA 500 event in Abu Dhabi last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka strolled into the second round with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Ukrainian wild card Anhelina Kalinina in the evening session at Hard Rock Stadium. (Reuters)

    Edinburgh to host start of 2027 Tour de France

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2027 Tour de France will start in Edinburgh with the first three stages taking place in Scotland, England and Wales, the organisers ASO announced at a ceremony in the Scottish capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The women's Tour de France will also start from Britain in 2027, from a location yet to be revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be the third men's start from the United Kingdom but the two previous Grand Departs both took place in England, making these the first stages ever to be raced in Scotland and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two stages of the 2007 edition were in London with Yorkshire hosting the start of the 2014 race.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to an official report, the Grand Depart of the 2014 race attracted 3.5 million spectators to the roadside as two stages took place in Yorkshire, with a third between Cambridge and London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popular success was absolutely phenomenal," Tour director Christian Prudhomme said. "We were faced with walls of people, a great mass of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prudhomme said setting off from the "magical city" of Edinburgh was something he had in mind for some time but its remoteness had worked against it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scotland was already a candidate against Yorkshire for 2014 and one of the major differences at the time was the distance from France," added Prudhomme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since then, there have been new UCI regulations which mean that, once every four years, we have a 'joker' to start on the Friday, which fundamentally changes the deal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ASO organisers used the exemption in 2022 for the start in Copenhagen instead of a Saturday. They will use it again in 2027 to start on Friday July 2, 2027 for three complete stages on British soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Details of the cities have yet to be revealed, but the peloton will head straight for England, where the second stage will also take place. (AFP)

    Ohtani hits home run as Dodgers sweep Cubs in Tokyo

<img alt="Shohei Ohtani scores a home run at the Tokyo Dome. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796480_1_20250319221213.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani hit a home run but Roki Sasaki had a wobbly Major League Baseball debut as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 in Tokyo on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Ohtani thrilled another sold-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome when he blasted a one-run shot in the fifth inning as the World Series champion Dodgers completed a two-game season-opening sweep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese pitcher Sasaki showcased his ferocious fastball but struggled with his command in his first start since joining the Dodgers over the winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old hit 60 kph with his first three pitches and struck out three batters but also gave up five walks in three innings on the mound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Edman and Kike Hernandez also hit home runs for the Dodgers, who beat the Cubs 4-1 in Tuesday's Game 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 40,000 fans erupted when Ohtani hit a home run to right centre field in his third trip to the plate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The call was reviewed but eventually upheld, giving fans an excuse to celebrate a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs walked Ohtani at his next at-bat, prompting loud boos from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is a national hero in Japan and his first visit with the Dodgers has been eagerly anticipated for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were also waiting to see the hotly tipped Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed in Japan's 2011 tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander got his first MLB strikeout against the Cubs' Japanese batter Seiya Suzuki, letting out a loud grunt as he launched another thunderous fastball.
  <br>
  <br>
  His command faltered as the game went on and he walked three batters in a row in the third inning before getting himself out of trouble with two straight strikeouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edman hit the Dodgers' first home run of the season off Cubs starting pitcher Justin Steele in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hernandez crushed another in the fourth inning, hitting the ball high into the stands with a massive shot. (AFP)

    Snooker tournament slips spur Rugby Sevens resolve

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports chief Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that parties involved in the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament to be held later this month have to liaise and communicate closely for the Kai Tak event to be considered a success.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual extravaganza is moving to the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, having been held at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law's reassurance came after lawmakers in a Legislative Council meeting asked why officials, the sports park and organisers of a snooker tournament earlier this month had come up with different versions about wrong information given out to people at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Tse cited incidents where spectators were told they had to leave before midnight and a sign wrongly showed that there was a "curfew" in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the tournament as "a Cinderella event," Tse said it's important for authorities to clean up their act at the Sevens for a better fan experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien expressed concern over whether the government could get the sports park to have a designated spokesperson in time for the Sevens, which will kick off in less than 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Law said the park is actively looking into this and that officials are paying close attention in a bid to minimise the risks of problems popping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The organisers and government departments will have to work hand in hand. This is no exception. On top of that, this is a new venue. We need enhanced communications," she told the lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sports commissioner, permanent secretaries and I myself are all involved. We have been in close communication with the operator. We want the Rugby Sevens to be a successful event."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports minister also responded to lawmaker Yang Wing-kit's concern over transportation measures for spectators when events end late or overrun, saying arrangements will be in place to tackle these scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  A catering association had earlier complained that it was unable to host a bar culture festival in Kai Tak during the tournament, saying it didn't have enough time to obtain licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the administration is willing to streamline procedures and offer as much help to different parties as possible when it comes to hosting mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed the authorities never received a formal application, and that she personally checked and found that had the association applied, there would have been enough time for a licence to be approved.

    HK men's rugby squad unfazed by pressure at Sevens

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men’s rugby team on Wednesday said they are looking forward to feed off the energy from the home crowd when the Rugby Sevens are held for the first time later this month at Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad is looking to defend their title in the Melrose Claymores competition – a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Peter Jericevich says he is confident his players can use last year’s success as fuel to deliver on the SAR's biggest sporting stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, he warned his squad not to let their guard down ahead of their opening match against team China on March 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to achieve that last year," Jericevich said. "The key thing now is that first game. That's all we're really thinking about right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't look too far ahead. Right now, it's about making sure we prepare well this week and how we can ensure we're accurate in the key areas of our game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added home support will provide a major boost to his side's mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I really like about the new stadium is that it feels really close to the pitch. There's a lot of energy that we can definitely use. Sevens is a tough game since you're under fatigue very quickly when you're out there, so the home crowd behind us will hopefully drive us to perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Christie, the captain of the team, said he will draw on the personal experience from the past two editions of the Sevens to lead the young up-and-coming players on the squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can tell them how [the Sevens] was before and how it felt," Christie said after an open training session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all help each other out and talk to each other," he added. "If any of the new guys need anything, we'll be there for them. On the field we hope to just play the way we want to play, and the rest of the team will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, who was appointed captain in September, also noted the team will be looking to feed off the home crowd’s energy at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we couldn't hear anything because the crowd was super loud," recalled Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You just got to embrace it and enjoy, because it only comes around once a year."

    Nanjing to finally host athletics championships

<img alt="Armand Mondo Duplantis makes a run for the pole vault event during the Mondo Classic in Uppsala, Sweden, this month. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796377_1_20250319105616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis headlines a stellar cast in Nanjing for a world indoor athletics championships delayed three times by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nanjing was picked to host the biennial event back in 2020, then in 2021 and then again in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were all moved due to coronavirus rules. In 2022 the event was instead held in Belgrade and in 2023 in Glasgow.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now has the green light and Nanjing's Cube will play host to 576 athletes from 127 countries competing in 26 events over three days of action from Friday to Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That number includes 11 individual defending champions, notably world record holders Duplantis (pole vault), Devynne Charlton and Grant Holloway (60m hurdles), and 20 medallists from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis, Holloway, Hamish Kerr (high jump), Thea Lafond (triple jump) and Miltiadis Tentoglou (long jump) followed up their Glasgow indoor successes with Olympic gold. They will be joined in Nanjing by fellow Olympic gold medallists Yaroslava Mahuchikh (high jump) and Jakob Ingebrigtsen (1500m and 3000m), also world record holders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super excited," Duplantis said. "It was my first time competing in China last outdoor season for the first two Diamond League meets and I jumped extremely well, broke the world record, to 6.24m.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-born Swede comes into the competition having bettered his world record, for the 11th time, to 6.27m at an indoor meet in the French city of Clermont on March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Duplantis insisted there would be no recalibration of his season goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not really," he said. "It's not the first time I've broken the world record in the indoor season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's according to plan right now, as far as I want."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis said he knew he was capable of "higher heights," insisting that he was "not fixated" by a certain height.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It takes a little bit of time and it's by fairly small increments and it does get a little bit more difficult every time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd like to get over 6.30m in the near future and then keep pushing it from there. Indoors is a great opportunity always to break the world record because we don't have to deal with the wind and whatnot so we have a lot more controlled variables in that sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's reigning Olympic, world and European outdoor champion Mahuchikh, will compete fresh from winning a third European title in Apeldoorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahuchikh won her latest accolade with a best of 1.99m before deciding not to go any higher, towards her record mark of 2.10m.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won the gold medal for my country. Of course, I am a little bit disappointed because I wanted to try and jump a bit higher," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope at the next championships I will be in better shape."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norway's Ingebrigtsen completed a distance double in the 1500 and 3,000m at the Apeldoorn Euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Competitions and championships are what it is all about," Ingebrigtsen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always been training towards something and setting goals, with the championship in mind. That is what sport is about. Racing, representing our nation and celebrating the sport."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US team does not feature Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles. Marcellus Moore, Emmanuel Wells and Ronnie Baker instead head the 60m entries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holloway will bid to become the first hurdler to win three consecutive world indoor titles. Teen prodigy Quincy Wilson is another absentee, the 17-year-old having turned down an invitation and insisting "school comes first!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who was edged into Olympic silver by Lyles in Paris, is ruled out with an injury. Nishion Ebanks and Rohan Watson will compete in the 60m. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani admitted he was "nervous" playing in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as the Los Angeles Dodgers started the new Major League Baseball season with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese baseball superstar delivered two important hits as the World Series champion Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in front of over 40,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ohtani, a national hero in Japan, said he needed time to feel his way into his first MLB regular-season game in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since I've been this nervous playing a game," the 30-year-old said. "It took me a couple of at-bats to get into it but I was glad that I was able to do well in the later part of the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The series has been eagerly anticipated for months in Japan and excitement was at fever pitch at the start of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the occasion left its mark on the normally ice-cool Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous, but one thing I did notice was how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem," Roberts said. "That was telling."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers' Japanese starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto struck out four batters in five innings to come out on top in his duel with Chicago counterpart Shota Imanaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time two Japanese starting pitchers had ever gone head to head on MLB's opening day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demeanour he has on the mound, even if he gives up a run he's still calm," Ohtani said of Yamamoto. "He was able to grow into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The action got underway after a Pokemon-themed opening ceremony that featured an appearance by Japanese world champion boxer Naoya Inoue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani stepped up to the plate to start the game but the first pitch whistled past him for a strike before he grounded out to first base.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs had taken a one-run lead by the time Ohtani came back to bat and he again failed to get a hit, lining out to second baseman Jon Berti. (AFP)

    Tennis players' union launch legal blitz against tours

<img alt="The Djokovic-backed players union takes aim at the sport's governing bodies, the ATP and WTA. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796331_1_20250319053811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tennis union co-founded by Novak Djokovic announced a series of legal actions aimed at the sport's governing bodies, alleging "anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) said it was suing both tour organisers, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) were also named as defendants in a series of actions in the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the ATP and WTA responded by vowing to defend themselves against the claims with the men's tour saying the PTPA has "consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA was set up by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil in 2020. Some 20 players were named as part of at least one of the actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades," said the PTPA statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tennis is broken," said Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement listed alleged abuses they are targeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the defendants "colluded", "fixing prize money and suppressing player earnings" forcing "an unsustainable schedule" and exploiting players financially.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies show a "disregard for players" by making them "compete in 100-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, endure matches that ended at 3 am, and play with different and injury-inducing tennis balls".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA also cited image right ownership, sponsorship restrictions and the "draconian system of ranking points".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also complained that tennis violates player "privacy rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Players are subjected to invasive searches of personal devices, random middle-of-the-night drug tests, and interrogations without legal representation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ATP said that it was continuing to make change, with player input and hit back at the union.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. The ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans," the tour concluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA also defended their approach to the game and said that PTPA's action "is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course."
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Djokovic and Pospisil, the seven-member PTPA executive council also includes players, Hubert Hurkacz, Ons Jabeur, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Taylor Townsend and Zheng Saisai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Nick Kyrgios, France's Varvara Gracheva and American Reilly Opelka have joined the PTPA's case in the United States, while Frenchman Corentin Moutet and Japan's Taro Daniel have joined the case in the United Kingdom. (AFP)

    F1 boss holds talks with Thailand on hosting GP

<img alt="Thailand's Buriram track hosted the season-opening MotoGP races. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796287_1_20250318195022.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One boss Stefano Domenicali held talks with Thailand's prime minister on Tuesday about possible plans to bring a grand prix to the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Italian ex-Ferrari boss who has just extended his contract to lead the sport until 2029, is keen to examine new markets as the sport soars in popularity, and Thailand has suggested it may be interested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of Formula One's 24-race schedule is locked in for several years, but gaps are set to open up and Domenicali suggested at the weekend that Thailand could be a contender to join the circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the talks, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand would move ahead with a feasibility study to examine the pros and cons of hosting F1 – including the costs and where the race would be run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not just about the honour of hosting the race, but also a significant opportunity to develop urban infrastructure, welcome tourists from around the world to Thailand and develop industry and service sectors," she posted on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's northeastern Buriram track has become a regular fixture on the MotoGP circuit, hosting the season-opening race earlier this month, but the kingdom has never hosted Formula 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Jirayu Houngsub said the prime minister told Domenicali that Thailand would work with F1 officials to see how a grand prix could work in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domenicali visited Bangkok in April last year for talks with then-prime minister Srettha Thavisin, who pitched his vision of bringing a race to the sprawling, traffic-clogged Thai capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said at the time they envisaged a street circuit, possibly around Bangkok's historic centre, as the kingdom looks to boost its image internationally through a host of "soft power" initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Thailand is not the only country knocking at F1's door – historic hosts France and Germany are seeking a return to the calendar, while the Turkish Grand Prix, last held in 2021, is also seen as a likely candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-Pacific region currently hosts four races – in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – while Thailand is represented on the grid by Alex Albon of Williams, who finished fifth in Melbourne. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China women’s rugby team on Tuesday said they are ready to take their game to the next level at the upcoming Rugby Sevens, to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Natasha Olson-Thorne was brimming with excitement over playing in front of the home crowd in Kai Tak Stadium, telling RTHK her team is keen to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wants to build on their success last year when they were runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition, a tournament among Asian teams which runs alongside the showpiece Sevens event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just got to take it in," Olson-Thorne said during an open training session. "Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressure is something that we should enjoy, because we don't often get the chance to perform in front of our home crowd, friends, and family," she added. "So taking that and knowing they're behind us, that's a really important feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  Olson-Thorne, who made her international Sevens debut during the 2011 Hong Kong Women's Sevens, also said intense training sessions ahead of this year's competition has strengthened the bond between her teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been working on our physicality in the contact area, and also learning to trust ourselves and the team more," she explained. "It's brought us closer together and we're excited to showcase what we've learnt come the Hong Kong Sevens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chloe Chan, who late last year was selected as the new co-captain of the women's side, said she hopes to encourage her teammates to play to their strengths on the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The thing about our team is that we're all so different," said Chan. "We've got speed, we've got physical players, and bigger players who can help us build that foundation in our structure. That's the one thing we know we're good at – using each other's strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added she will do what she can to lead her teammates on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not a very vocal leader, so I don't really like to talk that much. But I like to think I can lead by example, so I'm hoping I can do my job the right way and build each other to do the same thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Andy Vilk, meanwhile, said he is looking forward to feeding off last year's energy, and said this year's Sevens will be a "unique experience" for his young squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year was a fantastic experience. It's an important experience for the players and their growth and to be able to play with that kind of pressure. We need to understand how we're going to embrace that pressure and use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vilk – who took up coaching duties just weeks before the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou – said his side will be ready to take on powerhouses Thailand and Kazakhstan in the Melrose Claymores, when the highly-anticipated three-day sporting event kicks off on March 28.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi will miss two World Cup qualifiers after he was left out of the Argentina squad for games against Uruguay and Brazil because he reportedly suffered an injury in a club game.
 <br>
  <br>
  After missing three games for his club, Inter Miami, at the start of March with a pulled muscle, the 37-year-old Messi returned with a goal off the bench in a Concacaf Champions Cup win. He played a full 90 minutes and scored again in an MLS win in Atlanta on Sunday but, Argentinian media reported, then felt muscle discomfort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, the defending World Cup champions, can ensure qualification for next year's tournament in their two games on the current international group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They lead the 10-team South American qualifying group by five points from Uruguay and visit Montevideo on Friday before hosting Brazil in Buenos Aires on March 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams qualify directly for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The seventh-placed team is currently Bolivia with 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 12 rounds, Messi is the top scorer in the competition with six goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina are also without injured Roma striker Paulo Dybala and River Plate full-back Paulo Montiel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, will be without 33-year-old Neymar, who has suffered a thigh injury and has had to postpone his return to the national team, who are fifth, seven points behind Argentina. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach has announced that boxing is set to be among the sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after a new governing body is selected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bach said the IOC's Executive Board approved including boxing on the 2028 programme after his organisation recognised World Boxing to oversee the sport at the Olympics, ending years of divisions over the way the sport is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision still needs to be rubber-stamped by a full IOC Session of about 100 members later this week, but that is expected to be a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC stepped in to organise the boxing tournaments at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Olympics last year after breaking with the Russian-led International Boxing Association over financial, governance and ethical concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bach had warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and "reliable" international partner if it wanted to be included at the 2028 Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the IOC provisionally recognised World Boxing as the body to oversee the sport at future Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very confident that the session will approve it so that all the boxers of the world then have certainty that they can participate in the Olympic Games LA 2028 if their national federation is recognised by World Boxing," Bach said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  IOC members will elect Bach's successor on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front-runners in the field of seven candidates are IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe and former Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe. (AFP)

    McIlroy wins second Players Championship title

<img alt="The win was McIlroy's second in his career at the annual PGA Tour competiton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796153_1_20250318053122.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy cruised to a St. Patrick's Day victory at the Players Championship after defeating J.J. Spaun in a playoff at TPC Sawgrass in Florida.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-time major champion completed the three-hole shoot-out in one over par, while Spaun's challenge wilted after a disastrous triple-bogey on the second playoff hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the third time I've won on St. Patrick's Day, so it's been a good luck charm for me," McIlroy said after sealing the second Players Championship of his career and 28th PGA Tour title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky enough to do enough to get it done, but unbelievably proud and happy to win my second Players. It's really nice," McIlroy added. "I went home last night thinking 'I should have had this.' But I went home and reset, didn't have a great night's sleep, but was lucky enough to get it done."
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy had finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with Spaun following Sunday's storm-hit final round after failing to hold on to a three-shot lead with five holes to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after returning to the course on Monday in bright, breezy conditions, there was no sign of a repeat of the late stumble by McIlroy on Sunday that had allowed Spaun to force his way into the first playoff of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy struck first on the opening playoff hole, the par-five 16th, crushing a 336-yard drive straight down the fairway before reaching the green in two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun meanwhile looked out of sorts from the get-go, finding the fairway rough off the tee before landing his second shot into the greenside bunker.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy failed to make his 33-foot eagle putt but calmly rolled in an awkward five-footer for birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, whose recovery out of the bunker left him with a long, unsuccessful birdie putt, could only par.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that early wobble, things got worse for Spaun at the par-three 17th island hole, with the American plunging his tee-shot into the water behind the green.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun then missed a long 10-foot putt for double bogey and eventually finished with a triple-bogey six.
  <br>
  <br>
  While McIlroy missed his birdie chance and a 10-footer to save par, his bogey four still left him three shots clear heading to the 18th. McIlroy's tee-shot on the last went well wide of the right fairway, but Spaun was unable to exert pressure, also going wide of the fairway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players reached the green in three and missed their par putts. McIlroy coolly tapped in for bogey to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy's win marked the second title of the season for the Northern Irishman as he build towards the Masters in Augusta next month – the only major missing from his collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy said his early season form was a reward for the hard work he has put in over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've worked really hard – I feel like I'm a way more complete player than I was a few years ago," McIlroy told NBC. "I feel like I can play in all conditions and anything that comes my way. Really happy that I was able to get it done today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, meanwhile, was left reflecting on a disappointing outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard not to feel discouraged a little bit, but nothing but positives," Spaun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putting myself in contention and giving myself a chance to win in a playoff – if someone had told me that would happen at the start of the week I would totally have taken it," he added. "Hopefully I can just learn from this and get it done next time." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic women's badminton champion An Se-young came from behind to beat China's Wang Zhiyi 13-21, 21-18, 21-18 in a classic All England Open final as top seed Shi Yuqi lifted the men's crown.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Wang won the first game convincingly on Sunday and edged into a 13-10 lead during a captivating second game in Birmingham but the South Korean 2023 champion pegged her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang scented victory when the scores were tied at 18-18 in the second game but her South Korean opponent took the next three points to level the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decider was also a tight affair but again An, 23, pulled away when the players were level at 18-18, winning her fourth tournament in a row and second at the All England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had all sorts of emotions going through my mind during the second game," said An. "The thought that was concrete in my mind was not giving up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That thought motivated me to keep playing and I think that led to today's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't even try to describe how hard today's match was. The match didn't go as I'd planned, which made me extra tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm pleased with the outcome of the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, China's men's world number one Shi delivered a composed performance to see off Lee Chia-hao of Chinese Taipei 21-17, 21-19, also collecting his second All England crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, ranked 22nd, was quickly out of the blocks and opened up a three-point lead, but Shi reeled off six straight points to lead 9-6 and never relinquished his advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tenacious Lee held a 10-9 lead in the second game but he could not pull away from his 29-year-old opponent, who also won the tournament in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shi was briefly made to sweat after his 20-16 lead narrowed to 20-19 but he held his nerve to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been seven years," said Shi. "A lot has happened during these seven years, ups and downs. I've been to a few semi-finals and didn't make it in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After these seven years I'm delighted I could win it again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great that I can pass on some positive energy and values to the fans and in return they offer me support and encouragement." (AFP)

    Draper powers past Rune to claim first ATP 1000 title

<img alt="Draper will make his top ten debut at seventh in the world after the victory at Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795988_1_20250317081126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Jack Draper roared past Denmark's Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 to win his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 14th-ranked Briton, who toppled two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, didn't face a break point as he subdued the 13th ranked Dane in just 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll make his top 10 debut on Monday at seventh in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's incredible," said Draper, a US Open semi-finalist last year whose preparations for 2025 were hindered by a flare-up of hip tendinitis. "I'm just so grateful and happy to be out here, to be able to play, my body feeling healthy, to feel great in my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the work I've done over the last few years, it feels like it's all coming together on the big stage and I can't put that into words," added the 23-year-old, who also missed significant time with a shoulder injury in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper was rock-solid in his first Masters 1000 final, racing to a 4-0 lead as Rune made a nervous start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper dropped just four points on serve in the opening set as Rune, who burst on the scene with a precocious Paris Masters triumph in 2022, had 10 of his 19 unforced errors in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane had managed to hold serve twice before Draper pocketed the set, giving himself set point with an ace before Rune thumped a backhand into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper broke Rune to open the second set, and even though the Dane got a few more looks at Draper's second serve he couldn't take advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper seized a second break for a 5-2 lead and after sending a forehand long on his first match point he had the win when Rune went long with a backhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper's run to a third career title included victories not only over Alcaraz but also over 2022 Indian Wells winner Taylor Fritz and big-hitting home hope Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty," Draper said. "It's an emotional feeling to know how much you've gone through and put in and to be here now to say that I'm going to be number seven in the world tomorrow, I can't tell you how much that means to me." (AFP)

    Australia's Gout Gout clocks world-leading 200m time

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian sprinting prodigy Gout Gout ran the fastest men's 200m in the world this year, with the 17-year-old saying he felt "literally free".
 <br>
  <br>
  The youngster rose to prominence in December when he clocked the quickest time ever by a 16-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  That mark broke Usain Bolt's personal best at the same age, with his 20.04secs also bettering Peter Norman's Australian record of 20.06 from the 1968 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He turned heads again on Sunday with a 20.05 in the heats of the Queensland State Championships – the fastest in the world this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gout then smashed through the 20-second barrier in the final with a 19.98, but it was wind-assisted so deemed illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt literally free. I had 80 metres left to go, and I thought, let's send it," he said of the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only from then did I believe I had a chance of going sub (20)," he added. "Seeing the clock, I was really happy and surprised in a way, but it just felt like a weight off my shoulders. Now that I've done it, I've just got to do that more consistently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lanky Gout, who was born in Australia after his parents migrated from South Sudan, has drawn comparisons with eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics President Sebastian Coe recently said he was a rare talent but needed "nurturing and protecting".
  <br>
  <br>
  The qualifying mark for this year's World Athletics Championships in Tokyo is 20.16, which Gout has now beaten twice. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paolo Banchero scored 24 points as the Orlando Magic overturned a 13-point deficit to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' 16-game unbeaten streak with a gutsy 108-103 road victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland, the runaway Eastern Conference leaders, had looked poised to extend their franchise-record winning run after surging clear of Orlando early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a season where they have staged hefty winning comebacks of their own, the tables turned on Cleveland in the face of a furious burst of Orlando scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic outscored Cleveland 35-23 in the third quarter, with Franz Wagner leading the charge with nine points and Banchero adding seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Cleveland led by a slender 83-82 margin heading into the fourth quarter, and threatened to stretch away once more after Donovan Mitchell's driving layup made it 91-84, Orlando refused to roll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more points from Wagner in the final frame and five apiece from Banchero and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope saw the Magic home to silence a 19,432 sellout crowd at Cleveland's Rocket Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former number one NBA Draft pick Banchero finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists while Wagner added 22 points with eight rebounds and two assists as Orlando improved to 32-37 to remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the Cleveland scoring with 23 points, with Jarrett Allen finishing on 20 and Darius Garland adding 19. (AFP)

    Andreeva downs Sabalenka for Indian Wells title

<img alt="Russia's Mirra Andreeva celebrates after defeating Aryna Sabalenka at the Indian Wells tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795977_1_20250317054052.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva toppled world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to capture her second WTA 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, who last month become the youngest ever player to win an elite 1000 level crown with her triumph in Dubai, ended a frustrating run against the Belarusian to ensure she will rise to a career-high sixth in the world on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva shook off her first set problems and broke Sabalenka three times in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a match of swinging shifts of momentum, Andreeva was in full control by the end, giving herself a match point on Sabalenka's serve with a defensive lob that forced a miss from the number one and clinching victory with a forehand winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank myself for fighting to the end," Andreeva said. "I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna she was sending bullets and it was really hard to keep up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva claimed her first hard court victory over Sabalenka, who had beaten her twice already this year at Brisbane and the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka had powered into the final without dropping a set but it was another disappointment for the Belarusian, who was stunned by Madison Keys in the final at Melbourne to see her bid for a third successive Australian Open title denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva had Sabalenka under pressure early, and the youngster's frustration was evident as she was unable to convert four break points in the third game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka took full advantage, breaking the Russian to love for a 3-1 lead and keeping her foot firmly on the accelerator from there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka backed up her power from the baseline with some confident forays to the net, breaking Andreeva to take the opening set in 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka fought off another three break points to open the second set, but Andreeva finally gained a foothold with a break for 2-1, pouncing on a Sabalenka second serve to end a run of 18 missed break point chances against the Belarusian this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva followed with a quick hold for 3-1 and suddenly it was Sabalenka who looked lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva saved a pair of break points to push her lead to 4-2, her winners tally climbing with her confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After missing one chance to take the set on Sabalenka's serve, Andreeva sealed the set with her first love service game, complete with a pair of aces to close it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian maintained her momentum as she broke Sabalenka to love to open the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka promptly broke back, but that proved just a speedbump as Andreeva broke again for 2-1 and didn't face another break point on the way to her first career win over a reigning number one. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win," Howe said. "We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled "entertainers" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failures
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to "write your name in the history books".
  <br>
  <br>
  They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn's goal – Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 – capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's challenge for a place in next season's Champions League faltered in a toothless 1-0 defeat at Arsenal, as Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the only goal of a disappointing contest at the Emirates as Arsenal pulled clear in second place and to within 12 points of runaway leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea badly missed the presence of the absent Cole Palmer due to injury as they meekly surrendered to a damaging defeat for their hopes of a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues remain in fourth for now but have five sides from fifth-placed Manchester City to Aston Villa in ninth within four points of Enzo Maresca's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both managers are hoping to be stronger after the upcoming international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka is nearing a return for Arsenal, while Maresca is confident of having Palmer, Nico Jackson and Noni Madueke back when they are next in action at home to Tottenham on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did enough to deserve to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have struggled badly for goals since the loss of Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino into a makeshift centre-forward role.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish international proved the match winner from a corner as he looped a header from Martin Odegaard's delivery inside the far post on 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's Robert Sánchez made a brilliant stop to prevent Merino doubling Arsenal's lead with the best effort of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the game petered out with little goalmouth action as a limp performance will do little to quieten the critics of Maresca's style of play among the Chelsea support.
  <br>
  <br>
  United extended their unbeaten run in open play to seven games with a comfortable victory at seemingly doomed Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund ended a 21-game goal drought by firing United in front on 28 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho was made to wait for his first goal since November as the Argentine was flagged offside early in the second half. Garnacho, though, was not to be denied with a snap shot that Mads Hermansen should have kept out.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have won all four meetings against Leicester this season, two of which the Foxes' current boss Ruud van Nistelrooy was in interim charge of the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dutchman has not had the same impact at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester have lost 13 of their last 14 league games to fall nine points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy's men also set an unwanted record of becoming the first Premier League side to go seven home games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes unsurprisingly set the seal on United's win with a stunning strike from the edge of the box for his seventh goal in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham kept their season alive by reaching the Europa League quarter-finals with victory over AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, but suffered the latest in a series of European hangovers in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ange Postecoglou's side have won just three times in the 10 league matches that have followed a midweek European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a difficult campaign for sure," said Spurs captain Son Heung-min. "But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory for Fulham propels Marco Silva's men into the race for Champions League places as they climb to eighth, four points off the top four and three outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five finish will almost certainly secure a place in Europe's top club competition next season thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions. (AFP)

    'National Games test events show room for improvement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

    France beat Scotland to claim Six Nations

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France claimed their seventh Six Nations trophy in a record-strewn 35-16 victory Scotland on Saturday, shaking off their beautiful runners-up tag on a crisp evening at the Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus matched England's number of titles since Italy joined the championship in 2000 and did so in style, scoring 30 tries in a pulsating campaign to make sure they would not end up runners-up for the fifth time in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their only defeat came against England at Twickenham but Fabien Galthie's side put that 26-25 loss behind them by humiliating Italy before crushing Ireland despite losing their talismanic captain Antoine Dupont through injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts turned on the gas after the interval on Saturday, and prevailed through tries by Yoram Moefana (2), Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Thomas Ramos, who kicked the other points to become came France's all-time record points scorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland made a game of it and scored a try through Darcy Graham with Finn Russell kicking their other points.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who gave Galthie his second title after the 2022 Six Nations since he took charge in 2020, finished on 21 points with England second.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was party time at the Stade de France but Les Bleus only really got into their groove after the break, relying again on forward power to finish off a combative but limited Scotland team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont, who ruptured his ACL against Ireland, stayed with the squad and the mercurial scrumhalf received the loudest cheers as he watched from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  France started well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gael Fickou tore through the middle and set up fellow centre Moefana for a try between the posts while Scotland were down to 14 after Jamie Ritchie was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, however, suffered a blow when Peato Mauvaka was sin-binned for head-butting Ben White and the hooker look relieved when he heard the sanction was not upgraded to a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos slotted a penalty from under the sticks to beat Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points scored for France and give them a 13-3 lead. He now has 450 to his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors reduced the arrears when Graham touched down after collecting Russell's inside ball. The flyhalf converted and added a penalty to level the scores as French prop Jean-Baptiste Gros was sent off for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos, however, restored a slim advantage with a penalty on the stroke of halftime before giving away possession with a poor kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland's Tom Jordan went over after a superb Blair Kinghorn break but the try was ruled out by the TMO as the fullback was ruled to be in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielle-Biarrey scored a championship record eighth try in a single campaign after being set up by Romain Ntamack who had sprinted through the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came the bomb squad as Galthie sent five forwards on from the bench and Scotland cracked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos crossed the whitewash after another devastating rolling maul and Moefana, who bulldozed past Russell after Fickou's offload, claimed the bonus-point try. (Reuters)

    Ohtani hits home run in Dodgers' Tokyo exhibition game

<img alt="Superstar Shohei Ohtani sends the crowd wild with a two-run homer in the third inning. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795879_1_20250315205024.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani fever in Tokyo reached boiling point on Saturday as the Japanese baseball superstar hit a home run in his first game in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform in his home country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is in the Japanese capital with the World Series champion Dodgers to open the Major League Baseball season with two games against the Chicago Cubs next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old was in action as the Dodgers beat Japan's Yomiuri Giants 5-1 in a warm-up game at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed to its 45,000-capacity rafters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He gave the crowd what they were looking for, smacking a huge home run in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to see so many fans at an exhibition game," Ohtani told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It really made me feel like I was back in Japan for the first time in a while."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ohtani's first game in Japan since he helped his country win the World Baseball Classic two years ago in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was his first-ever appearance in an MLB uniform in his home country, having left Japan for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018 before joining the Dodgers in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yurie Sakamune, who was at the game with her husband Junji, said the couple had entered 10 times into a lottery to buy tickets and had paid 50,000 yen (US$335) in total after snagging a pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a dream," said the 30-year-old, dressed in a Dodgers uniform with Ohtani's name and number 17 on the back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been working every day to see Ohtani and I've put up with all the tough times for this. It's become like a life goal to see him."
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge cheer went up as Ohtani stepped up to the plate to open the game, drawing a walk from Giants starting pitcher Shosei Togo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He crushed the next pitch he faced, slamming a two-run home run into the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shohei, to be quite honest, in the last seven years has represented almost single-handedly the people of Japan," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for him to come back here in person, it's going to be an emotional night for a lot of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excitement has been building for Ohtani's visit, with around 500 fans waiting for the Dodgers to arrive at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more paid 2,000 yen (US$13) each to watch the team practice the following day, with Ohtani emerging for a brief workout lasting about 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slugger, who has been described as a modern-day Babe Ruth, gave fans more for their money against the Giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really cool," said American Dodgers fan Michael Artukovic, who travelled from his home in San Francisco just to watch the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is going on in our country where we're becoming insular.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to see this where people from all over the world are coming to a baseball game in another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers play another warm-up game against Japan's Hanshin Tigers on Sunday, before starting their two-game series against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of fans at the Tokyo Dome were wearing Dodgers uniforms, although there was also a smattering of support for the Giants, Japan's most successful team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atsuko Onuma said she was rooting for the Giants but said she had also come to see Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  She confessed she would have "mixed feelings" if he were to hit a home run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to see it but I also want to suppress that feeling," she said. (AFP)

 Lando Norris clinched pole position on Saturday for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri as McLaren fired a warning shot to their rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In scorching hot conditions at Melbourne's Albert Park, world champion Max Verstappen came third in tense qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell will keep Red Bull's four-time world champion company on the second row. Lewis Hamilton will start in eighth on his Ferrari debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the perfect way to start the year. A big congrats to the team, everyone has done an amazing job to start with a one-two," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it is just quali, right? Let's see tomorrow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is extremely quick. When you put it together it is unbelievable, but it is hard to put it together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm never going to get ahead of myself, I'm confident the car is in a good place but we have never run it in the wet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecast for Sunday's race is for cooler temperatures and rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris eclipsed his rivals with a flying lap of one minute 15.096 seconds on soft tyres, 0.084sec ahead of Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy, great to start the year on the front row," said Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy with how qualifying went, but just not quite enough in Q3, but it is a long season so a good start," added the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe left a little bit on the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  No Australian driver has won their home race since Alan Jones in 1980, but that was a non-championship race before Australia was added to the F1 calendar in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who was the pole-sitter in 2023 and 2024, was three-tenths behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen is chasing a second win in Australia after his 2023 victory to kickstart his bid for a fifth consecutive world title, a feat only Michael Schumacher has achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  RB's Yuki Tsunoda will start a surprise fifth alongside the Williams of Alex Albon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Hamilton were a disappointing seventh and eighth with Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz in the other Williams filling out the top 10. (AFP)

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

    Sabalenka books Indian Wells title clash with Andreeva

<img alt="Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka shakes hands with USA's Madison Keys after winning their semi-final match at the Indian Wells Tennis. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795836_1_20250315123114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka avenged her Australian Open loss to Madison Keys on Friday, thrashing the American 6-0, 6-1 to book an Indian Wells title showdown with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Russian 17-year-old Andreeva showed plenty of poise in a 7-6 (7/1), 1-6, 6-3 victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek, ending the second-ranked Pole's bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hungry," said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge after Keys denied her bid for a third straight Australian Open title in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused, I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was riding a 16-match winning streak, couldn't get a foot in the door.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think tactically I played really great tennis," said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to "just keep her out of the rhythm".
  <br>
  <br>
  The mis-firing Keys finally held serve for 5-1 in the second, but minutes later Sabalenka sealed the win and lined up a shot at the WTA tour's newest sensation Andreeva in what 26-year-old Sabalenka quipped would be "kind of like an old mama playing against a kid".
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva beat Swiatek for the second time in as many tournaments, having stunned the Polish star in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who hadn't dropped a set in winning 10 straight Indian Wells matches, looked supremely confident as she dropped just one point in her first three service games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Andreeva who claimed the first break of the tense first set for a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva stepped up her attack and broke Swiatek to open the third, and she sealed the win with her third break of the set. (AFP)

    Rashford recalled in Tuchel's first England squad

<img alt="Marcus Rashford has looked more like his old self since his loan move to Aston Villa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795783_1_20250314215113.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)

    Alcaraz stays on track for third Indian Wells title

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz reacts after winning his quarter-final match against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo in Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795712_1_20250314142648.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals of the Indian Wells ATP Masters.
 <br>
  <br>
  On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he stayed on track in his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was really difficult for me to start the match," said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He got a lot of chances in the first set," Alcaraz said. "I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults, including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian Daniil Medvedev, runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat young gun Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune, a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in two hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023, when he won five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round. (AFP)

<img alt="Bruno Fernandes was decisive for Manchester United with his hat-trick. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795685_1_20250314104926.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes netted a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1 in their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday, while Tottenham bounced back to edge AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rangers knocked out Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 3-2 on penalties as Chelsea saw out a 1-0 home win against Copenhagen to ensure their place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two spot-kicks and a late arrowed finish from Fernandes sent Man Utd into the quarter-finals by a 5-2 aggregate margin against 10-man Sociedad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it," Man Utd manager Ruben Amorim said of his captain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game."
  <br>
  <br>
  A 10th-minute penalty gave the visitors the lead at Old Trafford before Fernandes converted from 12 yards in the 16th and 50th minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Aramburu saw red shortly after the hour and Man Utd took full advantage with Fernandes rifling in a third three minutes from time and Diogo Dalot rubber-stamping an emphatic victory in injury-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's side will meet Lyon in the next round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals in either half from Wilson Odobert and James Maddison in London earned Spurs a 3-1 win against AZ Alkmaar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert powered home following sloppy AZ defending to get Spurs level on aggregate in the 26th minute, after the first leg finished 1-0 to the Dutch side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maddison put the hosts 2-0 up three minutes into the second period with an arrowed finish before Peer Koopmeiners responded after the hour to level the tie again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Odobert grabbed his second and Spurs' third on the night in the 74th minute to set up a quarter-final meeting with Eintracht Frankfurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times," Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing the first leg in Istanbul 3-1, Fenerbahce fought back at Rangers to win 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski produced two cute finishes in the 45th and 73rd minutes to force extra-time with the aggregate score locked at three-apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  But three missed spot-kicks by the Turkish side handed Rangers a 3-2 win in the shoot-out and a last-eight clash with Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall got the winner 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea through the Conference League quarter-finals at the expense of Copenhagen, 3-1 over both legs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Iga Swiatek beat Zheng Qinwen of China 6-3, 6-3, avenging her Olympics semi-final loss to the Paris Games gold medallist, to reach the last four at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world number two from Poland will get a chance to avenge another upset loss in the semi-finals, where she'll take on Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who stunned her in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek delivered another dominant performance as she continued her bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who won her first Indian Wells title in 2022, could also join Martina Navratilova as the only women to lift the trophy in back-to-back years.
  <br>
  <br>
  After dropping just two games in each of her first three matches, Swiatek was broken twice as she faced her toughest test so far, but secured the victory with a flourish as she broke Zheng at love in the final game after a brief shower paused play late in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek converted all five of her break chances. Zheng twice surrendering her serve in games she led 40-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng did manage late breaks in each set, but neither those hiccups nor the brief shower that paused play in the second set proved much impediment to Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end it got really windy, which made it super tricky," Swiatek said. ""When the conditions change during the match you need to adjust quickly and it's not that easy. I'm happy that I was pushing until the end."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek admitted she was pleased to avenge her Olympic defeat, a heartbreaking loss on the Philippe Chatrier court where the Polish star has won four French Open titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not nice to lose to anybody, so for sure you want to have a little, like revenge, but it's nothing personal," Swiatek said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She can settle another score against Andreeva, who kept her bid for another prestigious title on track with a 7-5, 6-3 victory over Ukrainian veteran Elina Svitolina. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Angus Ng was sent packing at the All England Open in Birmingham, losing to Singapore's Loh Kean Yew in straight games in the round of 16 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng came off an impressive victory over Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, coming from a game down in the last 32 to advance 19-21, 21-16, 21-12.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the SAR shuttler once again struggled against Loh, having lost all four of their previous encounters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng conceded the opening game 15-21, before falling 4-10 behind in game two. The Hong Kong representative stormed back to level things up at 14-all, but eventually succumbed to a 17-21 defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loh will next face China's world number one, Shi Yuqi, who beat Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-19. Shi is the favourite in Birmingham following Victor Axelsen's surprise exit earlier on Thursday.

<img alt="Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was the star for Oklahoma City yet again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795528_1_20250313112112.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder punched their ticket to the playoffs with an impressive 118-112 victory over the reigning champion Boston Celtics in a potential NBA Finals sneak preview.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander enhanced his credentials as favourite for the Most Valuable Player award with a superb performance to silence Boston's TD Garden home crowd in an absorbing duel settled by a burst of fourth-quarter Thunder scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Canadian point guard shot 11-of-20 from the field to finish with five rebounds, seven assists and 34 points, including 10-of-11 from the free throw line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City to 54-12, and guaranteed their place in next month's playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's win over a vastly more experienced Boston line-up marked another mature display from a Thunder side that is the youngest in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City effectively sealed victory late in the fourth, pulling away to open up a double-digit lead with just under two minutes remaining after Cason Wallace nailed a superb 24-foot three-pointer followed by a driving reverse layup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander said the Thunder's defensive solidity amid a barrage of 63 attempted threes from Boston had provided the foundation for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops, and that's been the trend for us recently," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're coming down the stretch against a good basketball team with good players, you've got to find a way, and we did so tonight and gave ourselves a chance," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Gilgeous-Alexander grabbed the scoring headlines, the towering Chet Holmgren caught the eye with a double-double of 23 points with 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all the know the player Chet Holmgren is," Gilgeous-Alexander said of his 22-year-old team-mate. "He's a stud, and he's going to be stud for a very long time. He'll continue to grow and continue to be special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Oklahoma City's balanced offense meanwhile suggests that they are well-equipped to make a deep run in the postseason as they pursue the franchise's first NBA title since 1979, when the club were the Seattle SuperSonics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite missing Jaylin Williams from the line-up, the Thunder finished with seven players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston's scoring was led by Jayson Tatum with 33 points, while Derrick White had 22. Jaylen Brown though had an off-night, shooting 5-of-15 from the field before fouling out in the fourth quarter with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said his team had failed to deal with Oklahoma City's physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were a lot of moments where we matched that and there were a few where we didn't, and I think stuff like that's the difference in the game," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Former badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen suffered a shock first-round defeat to Chinese Taipei's Lin Chun-yi at the All England Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lin came out of top after a back-and-forth first game before Axelsen dominated the second.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane was not able to keep that form in the decider, however, as Lin reeled off six points in a row on the way to a 21-19, 13-21, 21-11 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If I don't play my best, everyone can win against me," said Axelsen, the current world number four. "Today's opponent played a fantastic game, it was disappointing but that is how it is."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just tried to survive in the match," he added. "There is always a lot of pressure when I am here at the All England and every single day, and I got tense when my body was feeling bad and it affected my entire game."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid produced a gritty display to reach the Champions League quarter-finals with a 4-2 win on penalties against rivals Atlético Madrid, following a 1-0 defeat after extra time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side outplayed the record 15-time champions at the Metropolitano stadium for much of the game, but Madrid have never been eliminated by Atlético in the competition and they battled hard after Conor Gallagher's first-minute opener to secure a 2-2 aggregate draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thibaut Courtois made several saves to thwart Julián Alvarez and Vinicius Junior blazed a penalty high and wide for Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez scored for Atlético in the shoot-out, but his effort was ruled out as he touched the ball twice because of a slip as he shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcos Llorente also missed for Atlético and Madrid's Antonio Rudiger struck the winner for the reigning champions, who will face Arsenal in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played an average match at home, and here, we came out as if it was already won and in the first move they scored a goal against us, and that messed us up a lot," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We went to penalties, by the end we were very tired – it was very noticeable, and thank God we won," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético played with caution in the first leg despite trailing, willing to take a single goal deficit back to the fiery Metropolitano stadium, where they believed they could really turn the heat up on their arch-rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid knocked Atlético out in the 2017 semi-finals in the final European game at the Vicente Calderon, with this the first time the derby has been played at Atlético's new home in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  After defeats by Madrid in the 2014 and 2016 finals, the latter on penalties, and elimination on every other occasion the teams have met in the competition, Atlético were desperate to change the narrative, but came up fractionally short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It hurts, I think we played a great match, but unfortunately we lacked a bit of luck," Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. "The truth is that one feels pain, it hurts a lot."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético came flying out of the blocks and took the lead after just 27 seconds through Gallagher, levelling the tie on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul's low ball in from the right was not cut out by Raul Asencio and former Chelsea midfielder Gallagher lunged in to beat Courtois from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were content to sit deep and soak up pressure as Real Madrid pushed the ball around in their territory but were also ready to spring forward on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Courtois saved on three occasions from Alvarez, who had scored a brilliant goal in the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal drew 2-2 with PSV Eindhoven to complete an emphatic 9-3 aggregate win and set up a quarter-final clash against Real.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners demolished the Dutch champions 7-1 in the Netherlands last week, making the second leg at the Emirates a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who made seven changes from Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester United, were quickly out of the blocks, scoring in the sixth minute through Oleksandr Zinchenko.
  <br>
  <br>
  Croatian veteran Ivan Perisic pulled PSV level on the night with a fine finish past the sprawling David Raya but midfielder Declan Rice headed Arsenal back in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSV, seeking to salvage pride after last week's humiliation, equalised with 20 minutes to go with a well-taken goal from Couhaib Driouech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, who have never been crowned European champions, will play 15-time winners Real Madrid in the last eight after Carlo Ancelotti's side squeaked past Atletico Madrid on penalties following a 2-2 draw on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides have met just twice previously, with Arsenal winning 1-0 on aggregate in the round of 16 in the 2005/06 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said the club should enjoy the achievement of reaching back-to-back quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, when Arsene Wenger was manager of the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That tells you the difficulty of it," said the Spaniard. "We have to value that and recognise that it is very difficult to do it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've done it consistently and now we want to make the next step, which is going to be really difficult, but we are very capable of that," he added. (AFP)

<img alt="Darius Garland scored 18 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795390_1_20250312121604.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Darius Garland scored 30 points as the Cleveland Cavaliers staged a double-digit comeback to bag their 15th straight victory with a 109-104 defeat of the Brooklyn Nets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland looked to be heading for a shock loss after lowly Brooklyn raced into an 18-point lead in the third quarter against a Cavs line-up missing the rested Donovan Mitchell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Garland produced an explosive late burst of scoring to haul Cleveland back into the contest and extend the Cavaliers' lead at the top of the Eastern Conference to 55-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen of Garland's points came in the fourth quarter after the Cavs had cut the Nets lead to eight points at the end of the third thanks to a remarkable 49-foot three-pointer from Craig Porter Jr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Porter's buzzer-beating heave from half-court left Cleveland trailing 86-78, and Garland then took over with a dazzling fourth-quarter display to see the Cavs home to the delight of the Rocket Arena crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was the fifth time this season Cleveland have overturned a deficit of 15 points or more to win.
  <br>
  <br>
  A weary Garland admitted though he would have preferred an easier path to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sick and tired of comebacks," Garland joked after the win. "But we play hard for 48 minutes. We weren't shooting the ball the best so our defense took a stand."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This team is a really good unit – we stick together through the good times and the bad times," he added. "We were all locked in through the fourth quarter – that's when we put our hard hats on and go to work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson saluted Garland's game-winning late charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's the clutch player of the year," Atkinson said. "He just does it for us in the fourth quarter – he's done it for us all year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Garland received scoring support from Jarrett Allen, who had 13 rebounds and three blocks as well as scoring 23 points, and Evan Mobley who added 21 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The loss was hard on Brooklyn, who went into the game fresh from Monday's upset win over the Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas led Brooklyn's scoring with 27 points while Cameron Johnson added 17 as the Nets fell to 22-43 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm proud of the guys because the first half was impressive," Nets coach Jordi Fernandez said. "I just wish we would have been rewarded with a win." (AFP)

    Woods' major season in doubt after surgery

<img alt="Woods says he expects to make a full recovery after undergoing surgery. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795356_1_20250312082550.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tiger Woods revealed he had undergone surgery to repair a ruptured left Achilles tendon, derailing the veteran golf superstar's comeback plans in the latest injury setback to rock the twilight of his glittering career.
 <br>
  <br>
  "As I began to ramp up my own training and practice at home, I felt a sharp pain in my left Achilles, which was deemed to be ruptured," Woods said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This morning, Dr. Charlton Stucken of Hospital for Special Surgery in West Palm Beach, Florida performed a minimally-invasive Achilles tendon repair for a ruptured tendon."
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods added a comment from Stucken, who said the surgery "went smoothly and we expect a full recovery".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am back home now and plan to focus on my recovery and rehab, thank you for all the support," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods gave no timetable for his possible return from his latest debilitating injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the recovery time from an Achilles rupture can often last several months – which would almost certainly rule Woods out from playing in any of this season's majors if his latest injury follows the same timeframe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 15-time major champion hasn't teed it up in a tournament since the Open Championship last July.
  <br>
  <br>
  After another back surgery in September he did play alongside 15-year-old son Charlie in the PNC Championship family event in Florida in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has also played in the TGL indoor simulator league he launched with Northern Ireland star Rory McIlroy this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 49-year-old, still hampered by serious leg injuries he suffered in a 2021 car crash, hasn't played a regular PGA Tour event since the Genesis Invitational in 2024 -- when he withdrew early because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods had committed to play in this year's Genesis Invitational but withdrew because he was "just not ready" days after the death of his mother, Kultida.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woods's latest injury setback comes less than a month before the first major of the year, the Masters at Augusta National. He finished 60th at the Masters last year and missed the cut in the year's other three majors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the litany of injury problems that have dogged him in recent years, Woods has repeatedly spoken of his desire to continue playing golf at the highest level, albeit with a scaled back tournament schedule.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll play as long as I can play and I feel like I can still win the event," he said ahead of last year's British Open at Royal Troon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking in December following his back surgery in September, Woods maintained that the "fire still burns to compete."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference is the recovery of the body to do it is not what it used to be," he admitted. "That's part of age and part of an athlete's journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he acknowledged that he was uncertain about how much he would be able to play in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether my commitment going forward is once a month, yeah, I could say that all over again, but I truly don't know," he said. "I'm just trying to rehab and still get stronger and better and feel better, really give myself the best chance I can going into next year." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paris Saint-Germain produced a historic turnaround to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals at Liverpool's expense as they triumphed 4-1 on penalties after a 1-0 second leg win at Anfield.
 <br>
  <br>
  Never in Liverpool's history had they lost a European tie after winning the first leg away from home but Ousmane Dembele's early strike brought the French champions level at 1-1 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG were then perfect with their four spot-kicks, while Gianluigi Donnarumma saved from Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Enrique said before the game that the winners would progress to the final and PSG will be supremely confident of reaching the semi-finals at least as they will face Aston Villa or Club Brugge in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  A famous victory for the Parisians was deserved over the tie after they dominated the first leg only to be denied by the brilliance of Alisson Becker in the Liverpool goal before Harvey Elliott snatched a late winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The roles were reversed early on and Liverpool were made to rue not making more of their chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brilliant play by Alexis Mac Allister should have created the opener on four minutes when the Argentine's cross picked out Mohamed Salah, whose goalbound effort was deflected over by Nuno Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah sliced wide another good chance on one of the few occasions he got the better of the determined Mendes.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG took 10 minutes to ride out the storm from the home side before finding their feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors took the lead on 12 minutes when Ibrahima Konate could only turn Bradley Barcola's cross beyond Alisson to leave Dembele with a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French international has now scored 23 goals in his last 17 games and could have had more before the end of the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konate nearly made amends immediately when his low shot was turned behind by Donnarumma.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it was PSG who had the better openings to extend their advantage before half-time. Twice Alisson had to be at his sharpest to race off his line and save one-on-ones against Barcola and Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG beat Liverpool to the signing of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in January and the Georgian proved a constant menace to the Reds' defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kvaratskhelia's shot from Dembele's cross was arrowing towards the top corner until a deflection from Ryan Gravenberch took it just over the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved second-half performances have been a common theme of Arne Slot's first season at Liverpool and the hosts came roaring out of the traps after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominik Szoboszlai had a goal ruled out for offside against Luis Diaz earlier in the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Szoboszlai then had a goalbound effort blocked by Willian Pacho before Donnarumma made a vital stop from Diaz from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's momentum could have been halted by the loss of Trent Alexander-Arnold to a knee injury after the right-back landed awkwardly.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his replacement, Jarell Quansah, was inches away from winning the tie when his header came back off the inside of the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG barely threatened during the second half of the 90 minutes but Liverpool were left hanging on for penalties in extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lucas Beraldo's header and Desire Doue's shot flew just wide before more Alisson heroics kept PSG at bay with a stunning stop to turn Dembele's curling effort round the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Alisson could not save them in the shootout as it was the other goalkeeper who was the hero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma produced great saves to deny Nunez and Jones, either side of four confident strikes from Vitinha, Goncalo Ramos, Dembele and Doue to send PSG into the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the day's other results, Inter Milan are set to face Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals after seeing off Feyenoord 2-1 to complete a comfortable 4-1 aggregate victory. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lamine Yamal and Raphinha dazzled as Barcelona thumped Benfica 3-1, reaching the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted either side of a stunning Yamal strike as the Catalans dominated in the first half, building on their 1-0 last 16, first leg win in Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Otamendi had quickly levelled Raphinha's opener but the visitors were blown away at the Olympic Stadium as Barcelona progressed comfortably from the tie and produced some moments of brilliant attacking football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side will face Borussia Dortmund or Lille in the quarter-finals as they aim to win the competition for the first time since 2015 and the era of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suárez.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are candidates to win everything," Raphinha said, with the club in the hunt for a potential treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me the most important thing is what we did as a team and I am very happy with this victory," he continued, before praising teenager Yamal. "His goal was spectacular, it shows what Lamine is – he's a spectacular player with tremendous quality."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick said Barca would play for late club doctor Carles Minarro, who died suddenly on Saturday ahead of the team's match against Osasuna, which was postponed, and the players observed a silence in his honour before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What happened made us arrive at this game even more determined to win," added Raphinha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five-time Champions League winners Barca took the lead after 11 minutes when Spain international Yamal burst into the area, chopped his way past Florentino and then mishit the ball across to Raphinha for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica levelled within two minutes when Otamendi escaped Ronald Araujo to head home from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny excelled in the first leg as the Catalans claimed an impressive win with 10 men after Pau Cubarsi's red card, but might have done more to keep out Otamendi's effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  However Barcelona, and particularly their wingers Yamal and Raphinha, were in sensational form and they quickly reclaimed their lead. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Tuesday announced plans to build a new 100,000-capacity stadium that co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said would be the "world's greatest" football ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League club have been examining whether to redevelop their historic Old Trafford home or build a new stadium in the same area.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have now confirmed their "intention to pursue a new 100,000-seater stadium as the centrepiece of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area" as they throw their "support behind the government's growth agenda."
  <br>
  <br>
  Scaled models and conceptual images for how the new Old Trafford and surrounding area could look like were revealed on Tuesday at the London headquarters of architects Foster + Partners, appointed in September to design the stadium district.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium, at the centre of a regenerated Old Trafford," Ratcliffe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport." (AFP)

    'Snooker hiccup not a problem for National Games'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A local deputy to the National People's Congress has stressed that Hong Kong is ready to co-host its first National Games in November, despite a recent hiccup at a major snooker tournament in Kai Tak.
 <br>
  <br>
  Herman Hu, a former vice-president of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, told RTHK in an exclusive interview in Beijing that the organisers had "learned a lesson" after spectators were booted before the end of a match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly-opened Kai Tak Sports Park - the venue from where fans enjoying the World Snooker Grand Prix were ejected - is set to host a number of National Games competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite sure that [the Kai Tak Sports Park] is already ready," said Hu.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on the sidelines of the "Two Sessions" in the capital, he said organisers could learn from what happened during the snooker tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is not a big problem. I’m sure all the people concerned have ways to tackle that," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 13 days later this year, Hong Kong will host the nation's top athletes in cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hu urged officials to better promote these sports and educate the public on "how to appreciate" the competitions, such as organising district tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the SAR will help organise cross-border events, including a marathon and road cycling competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Hu, there was room for further collaboration with counterparts across the border.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I personally had a conversation with the Guangdong province's sports bureau and they welcome us to go there anytime. And especially they have a lot more facilities and high-quality coaches, world-class athletes, that can work with our youngsters," Hu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhaoqing, one of nine municipalities which make up the Greater Bay Area along with Hong Kong and Macau, will kick-start test events in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a written response to RTHK, Zhaoqing mayor Xu Xiaoxiong said the authorities were fully pushing forward preparatory work "in a state similar to a 100-metre sprint".
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu also said the Games could attract 150,000 spectators and tourists to the city, bringing in hundreds of millions of yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities from Shantou, a coastal city in eastern Guangdong which will also get a piece of the action, saw the Games as an "important opportunity" to promote regional cooperation and enhance its influence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New Orleans Pelicans will become the first NBA team to play in Australia when they tip off in two pre-season games in October, organisers said.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both matches, against Melbourne United and Melbourne Phoenix, will be played at Melbourne Park, best known for hosting the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The significance of this announcement for basketball in Australia and the NBL can't be overstated," Larry Kestelman, owner and director of Australia's National Basketball League, said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hosting an NBA team in Australia has been a long-held dream for everyone at the NBL and to see this initiative finally come to fruition after a 15-year journey shows that much can be accomplished when you 'dream big'."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pelicans, who feature two-time NBA All-Star Zion Williamson and top point guard Dejounte Murray, will be in action on October 3 and 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an exciting moment for our organisation and a testament to the growing global impact of the NBA," said Pelicans president Dennis Lauscha.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bringing the Pelicans and NBA to Australia for the first time is a proud milestone, and we are thrilled to be part of this unique opportunity to engage with fans in Melbourne," he added. (AFP)

    Newcastle sink West Ham to boost top four bid

<img alt="Bruno Guimarães put Newcastle in front early in the second half. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795186_1_20250311070727.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle reignited their bid to qualify for the Champions League as Bruno Guimarães sealed a controversial 1-0 win at West Ham.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil midfielder Guimarães struck in the second half as West Ham's claims for a foul in the build-up were ignored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side are up to sixth place in the Premier League, level on points with fifth-placed Manchester City and two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top four berth will guarantee Newcastle return to the Champions League after missing out this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even finishing fifth could be enough to ensure qualification for Europe's elite club competition depending on the results of the remaining English clubs in continental action.
  <br>
  <br>
  After losing three of their last four matches, the Magpies' restorative victory was perfectly timed ahead of their second League Cup final appearance in three seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, beaten by Manchester United in the League Cup showpiece in 2023, face Premier League leaders Liverpool in the final at Wembley on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Tyneside club are aiming to win their first major trophy since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and their first domestic prize since the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of our best wins of the season, not in terms of performance but desire and heart," Howe said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt we were in need of a win to go into the final with a real boost. It will do us the world of good," he added. "Also for our league table position today was vital."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham boss Graham Potter added: "We didn't do enough to win the game but we could have got something out of it."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The goal was disappointing, we felt there was a push on Kilman," he said. "It's two hands on the back. You can see from Isak's non celebration he thinks it's a push. Clear for us, but I'm not VAR." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander outdueled MVP rival Nikola Jokic with a 40-point performance as the Oklahoma City Thunder produced a late barrage to defeat the Denver Nuggets 127-103.
 <br>
  <br>
  A pulsating battle between the NBA Western Conference heavyweights was settled by a fourth quarter offensive onslaught from Oklahoma City, who outscored Denver 41-20 in the final frame to romp to victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander – widely seen as the front-runner to succeed Jokic as the league's Most Valuable Player – was instrumental in the Thunder's strong finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gifted Canadian point guard once again came up big when it mattered, slamming the door on Denver after the Nuggets had got to within one point of OKC at the start of the fourth quarter after clawing their way back from an 11-point deficit in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander added nine points in the fourth quarter to complete his 11th 40-point of the season, putting the Thunder within touching distance of clinching their place in the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder are now 53-11 at the top of the Western Conference after their seventh straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were able to get stops down the stretch and then just execute," Gilgeous-Alexander said of the Thunder's fourth-quarter bombardment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's what it's going to come down to when teams are so good. It's never going to be pretty all the time but if you get stops and execute you'll give yourself a chance no matter who you play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Remarkably, Gilgeous-Alexander's 40-point game came despite him making just two of 11 three-point attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 26-year-old shrugged off his struggles from long range by attacking the rim to keep the points flowing for OKC.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's where it all starts – easy baskets," Gilgeous-Alexander told ESPN. "That's my comfort zone. I didn't make as many shots as I wanted to, but we got a win so I don't care."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander meanwhile shrugged off the hype surrounding his head-to-head with reigning MVP Jokic, the Serbian star who came into the game fresh from a historic triple double of 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists in Friday's win over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love MVPs, I love All-Stars, I love all the things that come with it but none of it matters if you don't win," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "That's where I hang my hat."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilgeous-Alexander received scoring support from Jalen Williams with 26 points, while Chet Holmgren added 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokic meanwhile finished with 24 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, with Michael Porter Jr. also adding 24 points. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rohit Sharma made a combative 76 to back up a potent spin bowling display as India beat New Zealand by four wickets to win a record third Champions Trophy title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chasing 252 to win, India got off to a fast start through their captain's first half-century of the tournament before KL Rahul hit an unbeaten 34 to help seal victory with six balls to spare in the final in Dubai.
  <br>
  <br>
  India added to their trophies in 2002 and 2013 to go past Australia, who have two titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number's one ODI team, India finished unbeaten in the eight-nation tournament played in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is very nice," Rohit said. "We played some good cricket though the tournament. To have the result our way is a great feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been amazing, we wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour. Lovely playing with a bunch of amazing youngsters," star batsman Virat Kohli said. "They're stepping up and taking India in the right direction."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you leave, you want to leave in a better position. So many impactful knocks (Shubman) Gill, Shreyas (Iyer), Rahul have played. The team is in good hands," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Kohli and Rohit had a lean run of form in India's 3-1 Test defeat in Australia earlier this year and the pair came into the tournament with speculation swirling over their ODI retirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a battle of spin on a sluggish Dubai pitch, New Zealand's bowlers put India in trouble at 203-5 with Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit 48, back in the pavilion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Rahul kept calm and along with Hardik Pandya (18) and Ravindra Jadeja, who hit the winning boundary, steered the team home to loud cheers from a largely Indian crowd in a sea of blue.
  <br>
  <br>
  India played all their matches at the Dubai International Stadium after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan due to political tensions. (AFP)

<img alt="The result leaves Arsenal 15 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795028_1_20250310054122.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Declan Rice's equaliser denied Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim a much-needed win but Arsenal's faltering Premier League title challenge suffered another damaging blow in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners sit 15 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, now with just one game in hand, with their focus beginning to turn to holding off the chasing pack for a place in next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes' stunning free-kick put United ahead in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils, though, could not hold on for just a sixth Premier League win in 16 games under Amorim as Rice swept home on 74 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  United missed a string of late chances to win the game, with a point leaving them down in 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How we conceded chances in certain moments was not acceptable," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "They have so much quality and they pick the right player and normally that would end in a goal."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We opened the gate to lose the game. There was no chance to lose the game and we opened it ourselves," he added. "I will defend my players all the time but in those moments we have to do better."
  <br>
  <br>
  United have had three permanent managers and an interim during Arteta's five years in charge of Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim said he knows he will not get the time Arteta did to turn around a sinking ship at Old Trafford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discontent among the home support could be seen around the stands with many taking part in a protest by wearing black over what they perceive as "the death" of their club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This club will never die, that is clear," said Amorim. "You feel it in the streets. This is a big business and maybe all the fans in this league sometimes feel it is harder to go to the games and pay for tickets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had failed to score in either of their previous two league games to realistically wave goodbye to their hopes of a first title in 21 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite still missing the attacking quartet of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli, the Gunners hit back in stunning fashion to thrash PSV Eindhoven 7-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infused with fresh confidence, Arsenal started on the front foot but again missed the focal point of a natural centre-forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Midfielder Mikel Merino has been forced to deputise up front in recent weeks and fired wide from the edge of the area with an early opening.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have struggled for goals all season, but their skipper has remained a source of inspiration and Fernandes produced once more with a sumptuous free-kick just before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Questions will be asked over Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya's starting position, but Fernandes still had to whip the ball over an imposing wall and back down into the visitors' net. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Neil Robertson from Australia won the 2025 World Snooker Grand Prix on Sunday, delivering a dominant performance by whitewashing Stuart Bingham from England by a score of 10-frames-to-nil.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was Robertson's second championship title at the World Grand Prix.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final began at 1 pm, with Bingham already down 8-0 by the end of the first session.
  <br>
  <br>
  One spectator, Awlam, shared that this was his first time watching a snooker match, and he was excited about the whole experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Yes! Nice! It’s actually very nice. I’ve been here every day except for one. The sports park is absolutely amazing,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The whole development, including the stadium, the arena, the malls, and everything around it, is really impressive. I am very happy to see this.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Another spectator, Mr Chan, remarked that it was a great experience to watch snooker at the Kai Tak Arena, where the atmosphere was fantastic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s big and beautiful; it’s quite nice. And it’s close to the MTR station.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The match resumed at 7:30 pm, and Robertson continued his impressive performance, winning two straight games and defeating Bingham 10-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the day, an exhibition match took place between Hong Kong's top player, Ng On-yee, and world number one Mink Nutcharut, with Nutcharut winning 2-0.

    Fans enjoy the atmosphere on the final day of LIV Golf

<img alt="Many fans told RTHK the all-star player roster was a big draw for them. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795008_1_20250309201219.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spectators were immersed in what felt like a party-like atmosphere on the third and final day of the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament, as the second edition of the event wrapped up in Fanling on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fans told RTHK that the large number of star players included in the LIV Golf draw – a field that included six-time major winner Phil Mickelson and 2024 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau – helped bring more fans to the historic Hong Kong Golf Club course.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man surnamed Mok, who was at the Hong Kong Golf Open in Fanling last November, said it was a big step-up from last year's inaugural competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in the past, you might get one or two top names," he said. "Obviously, most of the LIV Golf roster are top players who won multiple majors. And I think that in itself is very attractive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also commended the accessibility for fans and families travelling to the tournament, which he said helped draw much larger crowds than he expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Promoting [the tournament] is one thing, but it also needs to be accessible," Mok explained. "There's an effort to make it participatory, rather than just putting up the names. The big events will sell themselves, but giving people the chance to access it in an equitable way would be great."
  <br>
  <br>
  Another fan from Argentina, surnamed Caceres, shared his experience as a first-time spectator at a major golf tournament in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people in Hong Kong love their sports and these kinds of events," said Caceres, who attended both the second and final day of the competition. "There's rugby, tennis, and now golf events – and every time I go, lots of people [are attending]."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many young fans came to support some of their favourite players.
  <br>
  <br>
  A local fan who was at last year's edition of the tournament, surnamed Nandwani, was at the event to see Australia's Cameron Smith in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  "People come in [from overseas] to watch this event. I think it's just a great thing to have... it's a great thing as a whole for the community to show up."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sergio Garcia of Spain on Sunday carded a seven-under 63 to take home the LIV Golf Hong Kong tournament crown in Fanling, as the 45-year-old claimed his second career individual title on the men's golf tour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard kickstarted his bid for a maiden victory in the SAR with an impressive early eagle on the par-5 third hole, before recording four consecutive birdies on the 8th to 11th holes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-time international tournament winner added a fifth birdie on the 16th to seal the three-shot victory in a thrilling final round.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My goal at the beginning of the day was to shoot five under," Garcia said after his individual win. "It was solid. I played very well, I gave myself a lot of chances throughout the whole day."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll admit I had a couple of bad swings, but I managed to get away with them and recover nicely," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Garcia edged out Dean Burmester of South Africa and American Phil Mickelson, who finished 15-under-par and 14-under-par respectively, to round out the podium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the festivities for Garcia didn't stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team Fireballs GC, led by Garcia, came out on top of the Team event – securing a double for the Spaniard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team finished one stroke ahead of Stinger GC, who carded a 37-under-par.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nice to see that not only was I doing well in leading the tournament, but also that my teammates were playing great," Garcia said of his team, which includes last year's LIV Golf Hong Kong champion Abraham Ancer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were keeping us there with a chance to win. Obviously, when you can pull off a double, it's a lot sweeter than if it's just one of them – so I'm very proud of them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the sports minister, Rosanna Law, who attended the event, and LIV Golf say they strongly intend to make the tournament an annual showcase in Hong Kong. Law said the sides are close to an agreement, but they're still working out the details.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament in Hong Kong was the third stop of the LIV Golf 2025 season, before it heads to Singapore from March 14 to 16.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool needed two Mohamed Salah penalties to beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 3-1 on Saturday, while Nottingham Forest took a giant step towards the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Manchester City.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool stretched their lead at the top to a massive 16 points, despite a lethargic first 45 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from a 1-0 Champions League victory over Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool boss Arne Slot made just three changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Dutchman was forced into making three half-time alterations to kickstart the champions-elect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The manager was like going for us - but that's something you need sometimes. Because first half, the game was sloppy," said Salah.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton have taken just nine points from 28 games all season, but stunned Anfield when Will Smallbone fired the visitors in front in first-half stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alisson Becker was Liverpool's hero at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday but the Brazilian and Virgil van Dijk got in each other's way to allow Smallbone to roll into an unguarded net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot turned to Harvey Elliott, Alexis MacAllister and Andy Robertson at the break, and the changes had the desired effect with two goals in three minutes before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darwin Nunez levelled with a sharp near-post finish from Luis Diaz's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nunez was then upended inside the area and Salah converted from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian slotted home a second penalty two minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 32 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have two games in hand on the leaders, the first of which comes away to Manchester United on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it appears a matter of when not if Liverpool will clinch just their second league title in 35 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest pulled four points clear of City in third thanks to Callum Hudson-Odoi's late winner at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Chelsea winger fired past Ederson on 83 minutes from Morgan Gibbs-White's pass to spark jubilant scenes of celebration as Forest beat the English champions for the first time since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time European champions, Forest have not experienced the continent's top competition since 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they are closing in on the Champions League with a top-five finish almost certain to be enough thanks to the strong performance of English teams in Europe this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not here to joke", Hudson-Odoi posted on social media. "Goal, MOTM (man-of-the-match), three points!"
  <br>
  <br>
  City remain fourth and are looking over their shoulders after a ninth league defeat of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men are likely to be overtaken by Chelsea, when they host struggling Leicester on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa closed to within two points of the top four as Ollie Watkins came back to haunt Brentford once more in a 1-0 win in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken let the England striker's effort fly through his legs on 49 minutes as Watkins struck for the sixth time in six games against his former club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton boosted their own Champions League hopes courtesy of Joao Pedro's 98th-minute penalty to beat Fulham 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raul Jimenez's strike opened the scoring for Fulham, but Jean Paul van Hecke levelled before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pedro's spot-kick lifts the Seagulls to sixth and within one point of City.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace shrugged off the loss of top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta to a serious ear injury to beat Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Ismaila Sarr's winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles have won nine of their last 11 games in all competitions and climb to 11th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves edged six points clear of the relegation zone after a 1-1 draw against Everton.

 Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi struck late to give his side a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday and keep them on track for a top-four finish and prized place in next year's Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  The winger picked up a glorious diagonal pass from Morgan Gibbs-White before running into the box and beating City goalkeeper Ederson at his near post from a tight angle in the 83rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a game of few chances, Pep Guardiola's City team came closest when Nico Gonzalez's long-range shot scraped the outside of the post, while Hudson-Odoi saw a curled effort pushed onto the post by Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result kept this season's surprise team Forest third on 51 points, with City in fourth place on 47. (Reuters)

 Two former world champions, Shaun Murphy of England and Neil Robertson of Australia, put on a show for fans at the Kai Tak Arena on Saturday.

  <br>
  <br>
  The other final spot will be decided later on Saturday evening, when world number one Judd Trump takes on fellow Englishman Stuart Bingham.

<img alt="Three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic has become the first player ever to score more than 30 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794896_1_20250308153519.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers staged a dramatic late rally to stretch their unbeaten streak to 13 games with a nail-biting 118-117 over the lowly Charlotte Hornets in the NBA on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Charlotte, buoyed by a stellar 46-point display from Miles Bridges, looked ready to score a massive upset after opening up a nine-point lead with just over five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who this week became the first team to punch their ticket to the postseason, rallied superbly to claw their way back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  A sensational Evan Mobley three-pointer tied it for the Cavs at 106-106 with just over two minutes remaining, before Donovan Mitchell put the Cavs into a winning position with six straight free throws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the scoring for Cleveland with 24 points while Darius Garland finished with 20 and Mobley 19 as the Cavs improved to 53-10. Cleveland lead the East by eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bridges almost single-handedly inspired Charlotte to what would have been a remarkable upset. Only two other Hornets players finished with double figures as Charlotte fell to 14-48 to remain one place off the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Kenny Atkinson said his team's determination to dig out victory augured well for the looming playoff campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thirteen in a row – I think yes, we're in a good groove," Atkinson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've had to scratch and claw these last couple of games, which is great for playoff prep – playing in some tight games and having to execute at the end of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our group's in a really good place. It did feel like our energy was a little bit down, but when our energy's high, it's really tough to beat us."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder extended their lead at the top of the standings after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 107-89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault could afford to rest Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren, Jalen Williams and Cason Wallace, but they were still too strong for an outgunned Blazers lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Wiggins led the Oklahoma City scoring with 30 points, while Jaylin Williams posted his first career triple-double with 11 rebounds, 11 assists and 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  OKC improved to 52-11 and lead the West by 11 games from the second-placed Los Angeles Lakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Denver, Nikola Jokic made history en route to equalling his career-high tally of triple-doubles for a season as the Nuggets downed the Phoenix Suns 149-141 in an overtime thriller.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic finished with 31 points, 21 rebounds and 22 assists to complete his 29th triple of the season. It marked the first time ever a player has scored more than 30 points, 20 rebounds and 20 assists in a single game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns, desperately needing a victory as they chase a place in the play-in tournament, rallied back brilliantly from 21 points down in the third quarter to tie it up when Kevin Durant drained a three-pointer on the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jokic took over in overtime to close out a victory that leaves the Nuggets third in the West on 41-22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Memphis Grizzlies halted their four-game skid with a 122-111 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, who were without the injured Kyrie Irving and Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant sparked the Grizzlies with 31 points, while Desmond Bane added 27 points, 16 rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grizzlies are fourth in the West with a 39-24 record, while Dallas fell to 32-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Miami, the Minnesota Timberwolves' balanced offense was enough to secure a 106-104 victory over the Heat, with seven T'Wolves players finishing in double figures. (AFP)
