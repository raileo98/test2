<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association has filed a complaint to the International Ice Hockey Federation regarding the altercation involving the Turkmenistan team at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chairman Sherman Chan made the remarks upon returning to Hong Kong with the men's team on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A brawl broke out after the SAR defeated Turkmenistan in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three SAR players were injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Tony Leung hopes the altercation will not affect people's impression of the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters at the airport that he appreciated the team's restraint in the altercation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Clashes are inevitable in ice hockey. This incident is very rare, especially as it happened during a post-match handshake," he said,
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, there are rarely fights in international competitions, or even during the match. Therefore, this is an exceptional case."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, "a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to get there. I promise Hong Kong that we will get there one day. It’s just a process that we take and we take this very seriously in representing Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey at the Games by losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan in the quarter-finals.

    Bayern sink Celtic 2-1 in Champions League play-off

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Kane was on target as Bayern Munich beat Celtic 2-1 in Glasgow in the first leg of their Champions League play-off, while there were also wins for Benfica, Feyenoord and Club Brugge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are hoping to go all the way to this season's final, which will be played at their own Allianz Arena in Munich on May 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  They threatened to run riot against the Scottish champions at Celtic Park as they dominated the first half and took the lead just before the interval thanks to a superb Michael Olise strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's second goal came just four minutes after half-time, with the unmarked Kane scoring with a cushioned finish at the back post following a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Kane's seventh goal in this season's Champions League, and his 29th in 29 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Bundesliga leaders took their foot off the pedal after that, allowing Celtic – who had a first-minute Nicolas Kuehn goal disallowed for offside – to come back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brendan Rodgers' team pulled one back as Daizen Maeda scored following a corner with 11 minutes left, but they could not find an equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's cliche to say, but it's the first half of the game. Overall, it's a really great result," said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany, according to the BBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Celtic's first home defeat since December 2023 leaves them facing a huge task to try to turn the tie around in Germany next Tuesday, with the winners going through to face either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility," insisted Rodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Vangelis Pavlidis scored the only goal as Benfica won 1-0 away to Monaco, as the home side were forced to play much of the second half with 10 men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benfica had won 3-2 in Monaco in the league phase in November and they came out on top again at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Pavlidis strike just after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the Greek international's sixth goal in his team's last five Champions League outings, a run which includes a hat-trick in the dramatic 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month. (AFP)

    Everton strike late to hold Liverpool in thriller

<img alt="Tarkowski struck late to salvage a 2-2 draw with Premier League-leaders Liverpool. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791408_1_20250213060806.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 James Tarkowski struck in the 98th minute to salvage a 2-2 draw for Everton against Liverpool in a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool edge seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, but were denied a vital win by Tarkowski's blistering strike after Mohamed Salah put Arne Slot's men in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure, Curtis Jones and Slot were then sent off as tempers flared at the final whistle on a night Liverpool will come to regret if they do not go on to lift a record-equalling 20th English top flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very tough," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We saw the celebrations they had in the end so we know how much it meant for them but the fact is it was disappointing for us."
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton are set to move to a new 53,000 capacity stadium in Liverpool's Bramley Moore Dock next season and gave their home since 1892 a night to remember against their local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mental probably sums it up," said Everton boss David Moyes. "A brilliant finish for us, to finish the last Goodison Merseyside derby and score in the last minute is in a way fitting."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's quest for a quadruple came unstuck with a shock FA Cup exit to second-tier strugglers Plymouth on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot made 10 changes as he resorted to his strongest available side with Salah and Virgil van Dijk among those who had been afforded the weekend off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's own FA Cup exit to Bournemouth on Saturday had punctured some of their momentum since David Moyes' return for a second spell in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Toffees had won their previous three Premier League games to pull nine points clear of the relegation zone and got off to a flying start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were caught napping on 11 minutes by a quick free-kick by Jarrad Branthwaite to free Beto, who beat Alisson Becker for his third goal in two league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors could have been swept away in the feverish atmosphere early on but the Reds immediate response was the making of champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexis Mac Allister started and finished the move as the diminutive Argentine midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to head in Salah's teasing cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton then suffered a huge blow as their creative hub Iliman Ndiaye limped off in tears after a long stoppage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first half never recovered its flow amid a flurry of fouls and yellow cards as the Premier League fixture with the most red cards in history threatened to boil over once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton started the better once more in the second period. Doucoure wasted a great chance to retake the lead when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home crowd briefly erupted once more when Branthwaite fired home only for the celebrations to be cut short by the offside flag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was growing visibly frustrated with his side's lack of penetration going forward and turned to his bench for an impact with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jones and Darwin Núñez sent on to find a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes worked as Salah delivered what looked like a potential title-clinching moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jones and Núñez exchanged a one-two and when the midfielder's shot was blocked by Branthwaite, it fell kindly for Salah to prod in his 27th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only a brilliant save by Jordan Pickford crucially denied Salah a second late on. And Everton rallied when Liverpool failed to deal with a hopeful ball into the box and it fell to centre-back Tarkowski to fire into the top corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy VAR check followed for offside and Everton fans had to be cleared off the pitch before the game could restart.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it did there was more fireworks as Doucoure and Jones were both shown a second yellow card for clashing after the Everton midfielder celebrated in front of the travelling Liverpool support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot was also shown red for his protests towards referee Michael Oliver. (AFP)

    Arsenal's Havertz out for season with torn hamstring

<img alt="Havertz's injury is the latest blow to Arsenal's Premier League and European ambitions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791406_1_20250213060238.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's bid to win the Premier League could suffer a major setback following reports Kai Havertz is set to be ruled out for the remainder of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The German forward sustained an injury during the club's warm-weather training camp in Dubai and was due to face further tests on the club's arrival back in England.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Athletic reported on Wednesday the 25-year-old Havertz had suffered a torn hamstring and could now miss the rest of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal, however, have yet to comment on the extent of Havertz's injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His potential long-term absence would though compound the problems confronting Gunners boss Mikel Arteta after Arsenal were unable to bolster their attack during the recent January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London club failed in an attempt to sign Ollie Watkins from Premier League rivals Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz was set to lead Arsenal's line for the rest of the season, with Arteta even saying it was possible the Germany international would have to play every game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus is already out for the season after he suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury last month, whle Bukayo Saka has been absent since December, although there are hopes the England international could return next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Martinelli, meanwhile, is also sidelined after he was forced off injured during Arsenal's League Cup semi-final second-leg semi-final defeat at Newcastle last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  All these absences leave the Gunners with only three recognised forward players in Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling and Ethan Nwaneri.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta may well speak about Havertz – who has scored 15 goals in 34 appearances this season – on Friday when he holds a pre-match press conference to preview the Gunners' league game away to Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are presently second in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Liverpool but having played a game more, as they attempt to become champions of England for the first time in 21 years. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Ice Hockey Association on Wednesday said the men's team put in a great performance at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  The team wrapped up their journey on Tuesday after losing to top-seeded Kazakhstan 24-0 in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association's chairman, Sherman Chan, said at least half of the Kazakhstan team are professional players, while many SAR players are either students or have full-time jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong's performance wasn't affected by a post-match altercation with Turkmenistan opponents on Sunday that left three of the SAR players injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game [against Kazakhstan] definitely showcased the team has been very disciplined as well as in terms of their quality, mental-wise, they are well prepared for any kind of challenge," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think obviously after the incident, a few of the players were upset. But... they mentally recovered very well and we all have this common goal to focus on the Games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said he has high expectations for Hong Kong when it comes to the World Championships in Mexico in April.

<img alt="Jude Bellingham's late winner helped lift Real Madrid over Manchester City in the first leg of their play-off tie. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791253_2_20250212063303.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jude Bellingham scored the winner in stoppage time as Real Madrid twice came from behind to inflict more misery on Manchester City with a 3-2 Champions League play-off, first leg win at the Etihad.
 <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland twice put City in front with his first goals in five games against Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the holders hit back through Kylian Mbappé and Brahim Díaz before Bellingham stroked home in the 92nd minute on his return to England.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have a monumental task ahead to progress to the last 16 when the sides meet again in the Spanish capital on February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clubs were meeting for the fourth consecutive season in the Champions League, with the winners in each of the previous three years going on to lift the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that familiarity did not breed enough contempt, Madrid's decision to boycott City midfielder Rodri's crowning as Ballon d'Or winner last year added extra animosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder was rewarded for his role in Spain's Euro 2024 triumph and a fourth consecutive Premier League title.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Spanish giants took umbrage at Vinicius Junior being overlooked for the prize and pulled out all of their representatives from the ceremony in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge banner before kick-off showed Rodri with the Ballon d'Or trophy alongside the lyric "Stop crying your heart out" from City-supporting band Oasis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodri's absence since September with a season-ending knee injury has played a major role in City's decline this season as the English champions sit 15 points off the pace in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent years Madrid have been pegged back on the ropes at the Etihad, twice conceding four times in three visits.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time the visitors had a series of early chances to sow more doubt in City minds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius' every touch was booed and the home fans were delighted when he had a penalty ruled out for straying offside before he was wiped out by Ederson. The City goalkeeper then made a vital save from Mbappé and Nathan Ake deflected Ferland Mendy's shot wide with the goal gaping.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men hit the visitors with a sucker punch on 19 minutes thanks to a brilliant team goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Grealish's dinked cross was chested down by Josko Gvardiol into Haaland's path, who stayed millimetres onside before stroking home his 26th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real came roaring back as Vinicius' effort came back off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  City also hit the woodwork through Manuel Akanji and Thibaut Courtois was forced into a spectacular save from Phil Foden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland remained a constant threat to Madrid's injury-ravaged defence. Ancelotti was forced to name midfielders Federico Valverde and Aurelien Tchouameni in his backline alongside the inexperienced Raul Asencio.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland's deflected effort that came back off the crossbar seconds into the second half proved a turning point as Madrid again took control. Bellingham headed wide and Ederson denied Mbappé as the pressure built before it finally told on the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé's finish was far from his cleanest but his mishit from Dani Ceballos' cross deceived Ederson and looped into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid smelt blood and went for the kill. Valverde drilled inches wide before Bellingham should have scored when he shot low into the legs of Ederson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was City who got the third goal when Foden was brought down by Ceballos as he weaved a way into the penalty area and French referee Clement Turpin pointed to the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland sent Courtois the wrong way for his 49th goal in 48 Champions League appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yet, by full-time the Norwegian was a disconsolate figure as City's poor campaign took another turn for the worse.
  <br>
  <br>
  Díaz had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds when he fired in against his old club after Ederson parried Vinicius' effort into his path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moments later the Brazilian goalkeeper was caught in no man's land as Vinicius ran through and, even as his attempt was heading wide, Bellingham stole in for a simple finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South China on Tuesday won the local top division basketball championship in dramatic fashion.
 <br>
  <br>
  Guard So Pak-hin made a last-second shot as the Caroliners defeated Winling 81-79 in Game Four, for a three-one series win at the Southorn Stadium in Wan Chai.
  <br>
  <br>
  South China entered the final period with a 20-point deficit, but they managed to erase it to take a one-point lead with a minute and a half to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bench players led the rally, with Anson Lam scoring 13 points in the final period.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the score tied in the final seconds, So, 23, hit a turnaround jumper with 0.3 seconds left to seal the classic victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Most Valuable Player of the Finals belonged to guard Kelvin Tsang from South China, who became Hong Kong champions for the third time in the past four seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so glad we listened to the coach and didn't quit," Tsang told RTHK in a post-game interview.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The eventful journey of the Hong Kong, China men's ice hockey team at the Harbin Asian Winter Games came to an end on Tuesday, after they were dumped out of the quarter-finals 24-0 by top-seeded Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs are four-time gold medallists in the competition and are so far unbeaten in this year's tournament after six games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The players from Hong Kong were outmatched early and often, trailing 8-0 after the first period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kazakhs continued their strong play in the second by putting seven in the net, followed by another nine in the last period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four players scored a hat-trick against the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong goalies Cheung Chi-ho and David Lam did manage 56 saves between them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team made headlines after three of their players were injured in an altercation with Turkmenistan players following a group match on Sunday.

    Top golfers ready for LIV tournament in HK

<img alt="Hong Kong will be the third stop of the LIV golf tournament. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791190_1_20250211170351.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LIV golf is returning to Hong Kong in March, after the SAR hosted the tournament for the first time last year in Fanling.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be the third stop of the tournament, following Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Adelaide, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Reed, who won the Hong Kong Open last November, is among the players who are slated to take part.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Reed said he could not wait to return to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't wait to come back. Coming back to the place where I got my 10th win, and also at the same time, to go out and shoot my first 59. It means a lot. I think the biggest thing is the spectators, the fans, the people at the golf course is just spectacular," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also participating in the team matches, Reed said all his team members are motivated and are ready to give their best.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone out here I feel like is motivated to go out and play well. We're playing for huge prize purses, but at the same time we're playing for bragging rights over not only the other teams, but all the other players," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another LIV player Max Lee, who won the tournament promotion game in Riyadh and previously won a BMW car at the 2023 Hong Kong Open, said the Fanling golf course suits his game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fanling golf course, it requires accuracy despite not being that far away, and there are different kinds of valleys. This is similar to where I usually practice. Also, the trees in Fanling are very tall, the wind directions varies. I am the kind of player that excels in hitting low golf shots, and my performance at the venue in the past few years have been satisfactory," he said.

    Rubiales takes stand at forced kiss trial

<img alt="Spanish prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso to downplay the incident.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Spain's former football federation chief Luis Rubiales gives his highly-anticipated version of events on Tuesday in the trial over his forced kiss on Jenni Hermoso that sparked global outrage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The case has riveted the country since opening on February 3 and has turned Hermoso into an icon of the fight against macho culture and sexism in sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales was forced to resign in disgrace in 2023 after kissing Hermoso on the lips following Spain's triumph at that year's Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two-and-a-half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales, 47, has called the kiss a "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up to now he has attended hearings without intervening as a slew of witnesses testified at the National Court near Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hermoso told the opening day of the trial she felt "disrespected" after a non-consensual kiss that "should not happen in any social or work setting".
  <br>
  <br>
  Her teammates have described how she cried and felt "overwhelmed" following the incident, while her brother Rafael Hermoso has said she came under pressure to downplay the incident to save Rubiales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former women's team manager Jorge Vilda and two ex-federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque, are also due to take the stand on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales minimised the importance of the kiss on Hermoso at the time and defied calls for his resignation at an emergency federation meeting in August 2023, railing against "false feminism".
  <br>
  <br>
  He resigned in September that year after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation into alleged sexual assault. (AFP)

  Oliver Glasner's side avoided a potential fourth round upset at the Eco-Power Stadium as Daniel Muñoz netted in the first half before Justin Devenny struck after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace will play second tier Millwall in the last 16 after the Lions won 2-0 at Championship leaders Leeds on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the second time in three years that Palace have faced their hated neighbours in the FA Cup, with the Eagles winning 2-1 at The Den in the third round in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The local derby offers Palace forward Romain Esse a reunion with his former club after his US$14 million move from Millwall to Selhurst Park in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am told it will be a big derby. The game happened a few years ago? But it is good playing at home and it will be a great game for our fans," Glasner said of facing Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They will be very aggressive but playing at home to a Championship side means we have to win. I want to go to Wembley," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace, who finished as FA Cup runners-up in 2016 and 1990, are 12th in the Premier League and were beaten by Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles won 2-0 at Doncaster in the FA Cup fifth round six years ago and they repeated the scoreline on their latest visit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could have decided it a bit earlier perhaps, but it was difficult circumstances with the pitch. The players did well most of the time and we scored nice goals," Glasner said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncaster, currently third in League Two, kicked off as the lowest ranked team left in the FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grant McCann's team threatened an early opener when Billy Sharp picked out Ethan Ennis in the penalty area, but his shot lacked the power to beat Palace keeper Matt Turner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace struggled to find any rhythm in the opening stages, but their superior quality finally shone through in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daichi Kamada's clever free-kick found Jean-Philippe Mateta beside the Doncaster wall and he fired against the post before Muñoz tapped in the deflected rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kamada tested Doncaster keeper Teddy Sharman-Lowe with a long-range blast as Palace hit their stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luke Molyneux, with 13 goals for Doncaster this season, nearly added to his tally as he cut in from the right flank and drilled just wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  England left-back Ben Chilwell came on for his Palace debut at half-time following his loan move from Chelsea last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devenny squandered a golden opportunity to double Palace's lead when he blazed wide from Mateta's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 21-year-old midfielder made amends to kill off Doncaster in the 55th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Hughes's superb lofted pass sent Devenny scampering clear on goal and he guided a delicate chip over Sharman-Lowe from 12 yards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chef de mission of the Hong Kong, China delegation to the Harbin Asian Winter Games, Kenneth Fok, on Monday said the international governing body for ice hockey has suspended four Turkmenistan players involved in an altercation with SAR players.
 <br>
  <br>
  Three Hong Kong players were injured in a post-match scuffle after defeating Turkmenistan 5-1 in a match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) welcomed "the quick and fair response" from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were notified on Monday afternoon that the IIHF has suspended with immediate effect the four Turkmen athletes, who had intentionally assaulted the Hong Kong team," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fok said the Turkmenistan players wouldn't be able to play in their final game of the tournament, a matchup for ninth place against Kuwait in Monday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed that the three SAR players only suffered light injuries and would be ready to play in the quarter-finals on Monday night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to emphasise that our Team Hong Kong China's players had always stayed respectful and friendly when competing, even when facing disrespectful and threatening actions," Fok said in a video released to the press before the suspension announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our players definitely did not retaliate or do anything reckless. This is worthy of our praise and recognition."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sunday's fight involving ice hockey players from Turkmenistan and Hong Kong, China may have escalated due to the physical nature of the sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the ice hockey game, it is quite violent. So in terms of our philosophy and sports development, there is a debate for games that have physical contact. If you play table tennis, you are separated [from your opponent] by the table. But for [contact] games like rugby, boxing, and ice hockey, how do we handle the emotions of athletes, that should be part of the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie added the incident would serve as a lesson for athletes to learn how to control their stress levels during and after competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He made it clear that contact sports often have stricter rules to protect athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The athletes have to stand out for a couple of minutes, or may be they are suspended for a few games or are even [given] a more serious penalty," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Louie hoped the incident would not affect the performance of the Hong Kong, China team in later matches at the Asian Winter Games in Harbin, and urged more promotion of professional sports ethics among athletes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday paid a visit to ice hockey players who were injured during a post-game fight between players from Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan at the Winter Asian Games in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR sports officials are demanding action from relevant authorities and have condemned the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmenistan athletes after Sunday's game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, who's in Harbin, went to the athletes' village to meet three Hong Kong players hurt in the brawl.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the trio were fine and should be able to play in Monday night's quarter-final clash against Kyrgyzstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE praised the players for staying calm and showing restraint during the incident, saying they showed professionalism and displayed sportsmanship.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I encourage them to maintain the best mental condition and play with a professional attitude, not to be affected by any incident," Lee wrote on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I also expressed the support of Hong Kong people for the ice hockey team, and encourage the team members to keep it up and focus on the upcoming games."
  <br>
  <br>
  The chief executive also called on the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau to follow up on the matter, and ensure the safety of the SAR's athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee was flanked by sports minister Rosanna Law and Chief Executive's Office director Carol Yip as he met the ice hockey team.

    Trump at Super Bowl in first for sitting US president

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790989_1_20250210120317.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Super Bowl extravaganza was watched by a star-studded 65,719 crowd bristling with celebrities and VIPs headed by Donald Trump, who became the first sitting US president to attend the event after jetting into New Orleans from Florida on Air Force One earlier in the day following a round of golf with Tiger Woods.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump has had an uneasy relationship with the NFL over the years, triggering uproar in 2017 after attacking players for kneeling in protest against racial injustice during renditions of the US national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the US leader was given a broadly positive reception at the Superdome after arriving at the venue shortly before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after arriving, Trump met with first responders and family members of victims of the January 1 attack in New Orleans that left 14 people dead and dozens wounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Later, loud cheering could be heard among the crowd when the Superdome's giant screen showed Trump saluting during the national anthem.
  <br>
  <br>
  That warm applause was in stark contrast to the booing that rang around the venue early in the first quarter when the same screen showed pop icon Taylor Swift sitting in the VIP seats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, meanwhile, expressed hope the nation could come together for the Super Bowl, which is by far the biggest annual event on the American sporting calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football is America's most popular sport -- for good reason -- it fosters a sense of national unity, bringing families, friends, and fans together and strengthening communities," Trump said in a statement released by the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This annual tradition transcends our differences and personifies our shared patriotic values of family, faith, and freedom," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swift, watching boyfriend and Chiefs ace Travis Kelce, was among a galaxy of stars crowded into the venue, with the likes of Beatles legend Paul McCartney rubbing shoulders with Hollywood actors Kevin Costner, Paul Rudd and Anne Hathaway and soccer star Lionel Messi.
  <br>
  <br>
  The catcalls for Swift -- who backed Trump's opponent Kamala Harris in last year's election -- were not lost on the US President.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump later shared a post on his TruthSocial network which read: "Trump gets massive cheers at the Super Bowl while Taylor Swift gets booed - the world is healing!" (AFP)

    Lamar entertains at Super Bowl with dig at Drake

<img alt="Kendrick Lamar was the main performance during the Super Bowl halftime show. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790985_1_20250210113933.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rapper Kendrick Lamar entertained a packed stadium crowd and audiences around the world watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, teasing and then delivering his ubiquitous, Grammy-winning diss track "Not Like Us."
 <br>
  <br>
  At the Superdome in New Orleans, Lamar was introduced by actor Samuel L Jackson dressed in a top hat as Uncle Sam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dancers in all white, all red and all blue piled out of a Buick Grand National GNX, the car that inspired the name of Lamar's recent album "GNX."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Lamar spun through "Squabble Up," "DNA" and other hits before telling a group of female dancers: "I want to perform their favourite song, but you know they want to sue."
  <br>
  <br>
  A few beats of "Not Like Us" played, but Lamar switched to a duet of "Luther" with R&B singer SZA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" is part of a long-standing feud between Lamar and Canadian musician Drake, and there had been speculation that Lamar might skip the song at the Super Bowl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Drake filed a defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group, saying the song's false accusation that he is a paedophile has put him and his family in danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lamar went for it. At one point, he omitted the word "paedophiles" - opting instead for a scream - but included a line about seeking "A minor" in which the crowd sang along.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Not Like Us" won five Grammy Awards a week ago, bringing Lamar's lifetime total to 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamar's appearance on the biggest stage in music followed big names from Beyonce to Prince, Madonna, Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Super Bowl typically draws more than 100 million live US viewers, the largest TV audience of the year. (Reuters)

 The Philadelphia Eagles soared to a crushing 40-22 Super Bowl victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, shattering their opponents' bid for a historic hat-trick of NFL titles.
 <br>
  <br>
  Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for another, as the Eagles avenged their agonising Super Bowl defeat to the Chiefs two years ago in emphatic style at New Orleans' Superdome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been able to use every experience and learn from it – the good, the bad, all of it – to pursue my own greatness," Hurts said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I couldn't do any of these things without the guys around me," he added. "We had a special group this year – we were able to learn from the past, get some nice new pieces and get over that hump."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chiefs had been bidding to become the first team in history to win three consecutive Vince Lombardi trophies following Super Bowl victories in 2023 and 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who was sacked six times and threw two interceptions, never looked like leading his team to glory as the Eagles' iron defence and clinical offense dominated throughout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles effectively had the game won by half-time, powering into a 24-0 lead at the break after three unanswered touchdowns from Hurts, Cooper DeJean and AJ Brown.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended the lead to 34-0 late in the third quarter before Kansas City finally grabbed three late consolation touchdowns. Eagles kicker Jake Elliott bagged four field goals. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) is demanding action from relevant authorities after two SAR ice hockey players were injured by their Turkmen counterparts at the Asian Winter Games on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two players are in a stable condition after getting checks by the team doctor and a local hospital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The altercation came at the end of the men's Group C match between Hong Kong, China and Turkmenistan, which the SAR came away 5-1 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua news agency, scuffles broke out when the two sides were shaking hands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Videos circulating on social media showed multiple SAR players on the ice as they were attacked by their opponents. At least one of them, Alvin Sham, looked to be in pain as he clutched his head with both arms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Referees and team officials then quickly intervened and broke up the fight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match report stated three Turkmen players were assessed "game misconduct" penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the SF&OC strongly condemned what it called the "deliberate attack and injury" by Turkmen athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  After reviewing video footage, Kenneth Fok, the Chef de Mission of Team Hong Kong, got in touch with relevant authorities and demanded disciplinary action be taken to ensure the personal safety of athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong won all three of its group matches and will fight for a quarter-final slot with Kyrgyzstan on Monday night.

    Plymouth stun Liverpool in FA Cup; Villa beat Spurs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool have suffered a stunning FA Cup exit in a 1-0 defeat to Championship strugglers Plymouth, while Aston Villa inflicted another damaging 2-1 defeat on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's decision to field a weakened team came back to haunt him, with Ryan Hardie's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset and ending Liverpool's quest for a quadruple at Home Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Andrew Robertson and Cody Gakpo were among the stars rested as Slot made 10 changes from the team that thrashed Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a remarkably successful first season in charge of the Reds, it was a rare blunder by the former Feyenoord boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only the fourth time that a team top of the Premier League had been eliminated from the FA Cup by a lower division club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Masterminding a famous victory over Liverpool while fighting to haul Plymouth off the bottom of the Championship was no hardship for Argyle manager Miron Muslić, who was a refugee from war-torn Bosnia as a child.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muslić–hired by Plymouth to replace the sacked Wayne Rooney in January–was forced to move to Austria aged nine after escaping his home town of Bihac after it fell under siege by Serbian forces in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  Plymouth had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the third round, but their victory against West Brom last weekend was their first in the league since November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm speechless, and normally they tell me I'm eloquent! It's a big day for us," said Muslic. "It's a magical day. I told the lads in the locker room to enjoy it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the circumstances, Plymouth's superb performance will rank as one of the FA Cup's greatest giant-killings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot wore an exasperated expression that summed up Liverpool's lethargy even before Darko Gyabi's overhead kick was blocked by Harvey Elliott's raised arm in the 54th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a clear penalty and Hardie kept his composure to send Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way from the spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez were denied by fine saves from Conor Hazard in stoppage-time as Home Park erupted in celebration of an astonishing result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, fresh from their thrashing at Anfield to exit the League Cup on Thursday, another chance at ending Spurs' long wait for silverware went awry for the under-fire Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  The writing was on the wall for the visitors after just one minute when goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky let Jacob Ramsey's shot through his grasp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min missed a huge chance to level for an injury-ravaged Tottenham when he was denied by Emiliano Martinez before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Rogers sealed Spurs' fate when he blasted in from close range 25 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Without a trophy since 2008, Tottenham sit 14th in the Premier League and now have only Europa League glory to play for this season. (AFP)

<img alt="World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said China is a growing market for running and athletics. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790947_1_20250210025432.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics President Sebastian Coe has praised China's exceptional capabilities in hosting major sporting events, citing the country's increasing athletic prowess, during his visit to attend the 9th Asian Winter Games underway in Harbin.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN), Coe reaffirmed that China is "world-class" at staging global events, as he elaborated on the country's impressive track record in hosting successful international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is world-class at staging world class events. We have three world championships in the next 2 years in China. We have the world indoor championships in Nanjing in just a few weeks’ time," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We then have the world relays in Guangzhou. And then the jewel in the crown in 2027 in Beijing is our world championships and it was in 2016 at the world championships in Beijing that I got elected as President of World Athletics. So, I consider China to be my lucky country."
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding his impression of Chinese athletes, Coe noted that he has seen significant progress as a result of close collaboration between World Athletics and major sports institutions in the nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe also highlighted that China represents a vast and expanding market for running and athletics, which is playing a crucial role in promoting the participation of young people in sports globally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The importance of China to world athletics is huge. You have more people that are regularly running than any other country in the world, in 5K's and 10K's and half marathons and marathons. And that is a very large and growing market for world athletics," said the sports body president.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's also critical because the Chinese government understands that running and athletics is probably one of the best sports for helping develop the health and vibrancy, both mentally and physically, of young people." (CCTV)

<img alt="Spain's Carlos Alcaraz celebrates winning his final match against Australia's Alex de Minaur. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790942_1_20250210005525.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz clinched his first indoor title on Sunday, overpowering a spirited effort by Australia's Alex de Minaur to win the Rotterdam Open 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number three Alcaraz had too much weight of shot off both flanks for his opponent, who retrieved valiantly but lacked the weapons to topple the top seed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz was first to seize the initiative, breaking De Minaur's serve in the third game, helped by a double-fault and some ferocious groundstrokes.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian, ranked eight in the world, struck back, breaking to love in the seventh game to bring the set back on serve at 4-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  An ill-judged drop shot at 0-30 down in the next game put the pressure back on De Minaur and Alcaraz produced a powerful backhand pass to give himself a chance to serve out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard secured the set at the first time of asking, De Minaur netting a forehand return and giving himself an uphill battle to get back into the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second set saw a shift in momentum as De Minaur managed an early break of his own and raced into a 3-0 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur squandered two chances at a second break but clung on to his serve to give himself an opportunity to close out the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  He levelled up the match at 1-1, as Alcaraz dumped a backhand into the net, having smashed two wild forehands long out of court earlier in the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive set went with serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz got his nose in front, breaking the Australian's serve with a drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur served to stay in the match at 5-2 down but hit a catastrophic double-fault to give Alcaraz two match points.
  <br>
  <br>
  He then pushed a tired-looking backhand into the net to give Alcaraz victory and a 17th tour title, the Spaniard roaring "vamos" as the crowd rose to its feet.
  <br>
  <br>
  For De Minaur, it was a case of deja vu, as he lost in the final last year as well to world number one Jannik Sinner. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong runners made great strides in the annual Hong Kong Marathon on Sunday morning despite the chilly weather, while the event was also marred by a number of disqualifications.
 <br>
  <br>
  SAR runner Christy Yiu claimed victory in the women's half-marathon, crossing the finish line at Victoria Park in 1 hour, 15 minutes and 9 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said her performance was within expectations, crediting the weather conditions for making the race smoother than she had anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the weather was really good. The humidity was only about 40 percent. The temperature was about 10 to 12 degrees, so it was nice and cool. When I got on the course, I found that it wasn't that windy (even though) it was windy at night," Yiu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was pretty good. I didn't need to use my raincoat. The track changed a bit, but was still good for running. There were fewer places with strong winds."
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's half-marathon, Vincent Lam from Hong Kong, who originally came in third, was awarded the title after the top two finishers – He Yingbing and Sun Xiaoyang of China – were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was faster by a minute when compared to my results from last year. I am also satisfied with myself. I have laid a very good foundation in the past year. I always had good communication with my coach. The weather was very good. Although the Observatory said it was a bit cold, it was not that hard to run," Lam said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 10km race for women, Candy Tsang from Hong Kong defended her title with a time of 35 minutes and 16 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's event, SAR triathlete Wong Tsz-to became runner-up after Lan Jiehuai of China, who had finished second, was disqualified. China's Liu Aiyan won the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dennis Ng, executive director of Hong Kong, China Association of Athletics Affiliates, said after the event that three male runners were disqualified.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Especially for the prize winners, we will verify their identities after the race. Officials found that the bibs they were wearing did not belong to that runner, so after we reported to the referees as well as other key officials, the organisers confirmed that the results were disqualified," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenya dominated the podium in the men's marathon, with Bethwell Kipkemboi taking gold in 2 hours, 11 minutes and 13 seconds, while compatriots Kennedy Kipyeko and Seroi Anderson came second and third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belarusian runner Volha Mazuronak won the women's marathon in 2 hours and 27 minutes, followed by Ethiopia's Emebet Niguse and Tadelech Bekele.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the runners on Sunday was Hong Kong movie icon Chow Yun-fat, who completed the half-marathon in about 2 hours and 24 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chow said the atmosphere was fantastic, and he aims for even better results next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope I can finish under 2 hours when I turn 80!" he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 74,000 runners signed up this year, including more than 15,000 international athletes from 101 countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma sealed a 2-1 win in the fourth-round of the FA Cup to dash Chelsea's hopes, while Kevin De Bruyne spared Manchester City's blushes in their 2-1 victory at third-tier Leyton Orient on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea haven't won a domestic trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 2018 and their wait will go on for another season after they blew the lead at the Amex Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were gifted the lead in the fifth minute when Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen fumbled Cole Palmer's cross into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a horrendous mistake but Chelsea failed to press home their advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thrashed 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League last weekend, Brighton bounced back impressively from the second worst defeat in the club's 123-year history.
  <br>
  <br>
  They equalised in the 12th minute as Joel Veltman's cross reached Georginio Rutter, who found space between Chelsea defenders Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo to flick a header into the far corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Brighton completed their fightback in the 57th minute when Mitoma clipped a deft finish past Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez despite the visitors' claim for handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated," Maresca said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1. But you have to take the consequence of the result."
  <br>
  <br>
  At Brisbane Road, Manchester City were rocked when Jamie Donley's long-range effort came back off the bar and rebounded in off City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give Orient an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions finally drew level after 56 minutes when Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov deflected in Rico Lewis's shot for his first goal since signing for City from Lens in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola had to turn to his bench more than he would have liked just four days before a mammoth Champions League play-off round first leg against Real Madrid.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of De Bruyne made the difference as the Belgian midfielder scored 11 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable. For the fans, how the crowd support and we knew they are strong," said Guardiola, who saw deadline day signing Nico Gonzalez hobble off injured in the first half of his debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle came from behind to win 3-2 against Birmingham at St Andrew's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birmingham led after 42 seconds through Ethan Laird's deflected strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  A quickfire double from Joe Willock and Callum Wilson turned the tie in Newcastle's favour, but Tomoki Iwata's blistering strike levelled before half-time for the League One leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, though, rounded off a fine week after reaching the League Cup final on Wednesday as Willock restored their lead on 82 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bottom of the Premier League and seemingly destined for relegation, Southampton got no respite in the FA Cup as Burnley won 1-0 at St Mary's.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Parker's team went in front after 77 minutes when Marcus Edwards scored from close range on his debut after signing on loan from Sporting Lisbon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is almost 600 minutes since Championship promotion chasers Burnley last conceded a goal, with 10 clean sheets in their last 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were unlucky to lose to a scrappy goal. We did lots of good things and created lots of opportunities," Southampton boss Ivan Juric said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last FA Cup tie at Goodison Park, Everton, who are moving to a new stadium next season, were beaten 2-0 by Bournemouth thanks to goals from Antoine Semenyo and Dan Jebbison.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz scored twice as Fulham won 2-1 at League One Wigan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich, second bottom of the Premier League, swept to a 4-1 win against Frank Lampard's Coventry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Millwall reached the fifth round for the first time since 2018-19 thanks to Femi Azeez's double in a 2-0 win at Championship leaders Leeds. (AFP)

    Maguire lifts Man Utd over Leicester in FA Cup

<img alt="Manchester United's Harry Maguire celebrates scoring the team's second goal at Old Trafford in Manchester. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790792_1_20250208104830.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Harry Maguire headed a last-gasp winner as FA Cup holders Manchester United came from behind to beat Leicester 2-1 on Friday, denying Ruud van Nistelrooy a fairytale return to Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bobby De Cordova-Reid put the Premier League strugglers ahead late in the first half of the fourth-round tie against a pallid United, who have lost their fear factor at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the introduction of Alejandro Garnacho at half-time gave United a different dimension and fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee levelled midway through the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's team pushed for a winner and it finally came when former Leicester defender Maguire headed in a Bruno Fernandes' free-kick deep into stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese manager, who is struggling to implement his ideas at Old Trafford three months into his reign, said it was a "poor performance" from his side.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't have any energy in the beginning, especially in the first half," he told ITV. "Then in the second half we played a little bit better, with a little more speed, winning second balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then we managed to turn things around so it was a good result but not a good performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The coach is the first responsible. When one team doesn't perform, doesn't improve, it is the coach but we are here to do things and to see the game, to study the game and try to improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  United scored eight goals in two games against Leicester earlier in the campaign during Van Nistelrooy's brief spell as interim boss at Old Trafford following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  But this time their former star striker was in the opposition dugout.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who beat Manchester City in the final at Wembley last May, were short of confidence after five defeats in their past seven matches at home in all competitions. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Friday declared the 2025 Asian Winter Games officially open in Harbin, marking the second time the northeastern Chinese city has hosted the event.
 <br>
  <br>
  He was joined by First Lady Peng Liyuan, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, at the extravaganza in Heilongjiang province.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd at the Harbin International Conference, Exhibition and Sports Centre cheered loudly as Team Hong Kong, China were among 34 competing countries and regions introduced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's short track speed skater, Lam Ching-yan, and alpine skier, Adrian Yung, were the flag bearers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city has sent 74 athletes to the Games, the most ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  Timothy Fok, vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, said China had played a big part in the growth of winter sports in the continent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A record number of over 1,200 athletes from a record number of 34 National Olympic Committees will be competing in Harbin, and this shows the remarkable development of winter sports in Asia," he said at the ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has played a big part in this, not only by staging two previous Asian Winter Games in 1996 and 2007, but also the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the loudest of cheers was reserved for the hosts, the last of the teams introduced, with China having the biggest team of 170 athletes at the Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national team's flag bearers were speed skater Ning Zhongyan and freeskier Liu Mengting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guests and athletes were then treated to traditional Chinese performances at the ceremony.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Forecasters on Friday said that runners taking part in Sunday's Hong Kong Marathon could face the coldest day this winter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some 74,000 runners are expected to take part in the race, with more than 15,000 of them coming from more than a hundred countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Observatory said the temperature could dip to as low as nine degrees Celsius in the urban areas on Sunday, and even lower in the New Territories.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior scientific officer, Hon Kai-kwong, said as strong winds were expected, runners could feel colder than what the mercury indicates, otherwise known as the wind chill effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because northern winds for the day should be relatively strong, we expect the wind chill effect to be rather significant - especially in open areas and on high grounds," he told an RTHK programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, the Hospital Authority's chief manager, Dr Larry Lee, said because of the weather, runners shouldn't over exert themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Before the start of the race, [runners] should keep their heads and hands warm, and they should stay hydrated," he said on the same programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And because of the strain on their bodies, from an event like this, runners should make sure that they spend enough time warming up. If they find they can't go on, runners should rest."
  <br>
  <br>
  Top local runner Virginia Lo said the cold weather should help athletes achieve good times.
  <br>
  <br>
  She called on participants to wear raincoats and running sleeves to keep warm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former world marathon champion Rose Chelimo is among the world's finest joining the competition and she'll be making her Hong Kong debut this weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Kenyan-born Bahraini won gold at the World Championships in London eight years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been preparing for long, since last year. It needs a lot of discipline and dedication from yourself, not following your coach or anybody," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ethiopia-born runner Gashau Ayale, who represents Israel, will also be making his Hong Kong debut, and thinks the local course is a challenging one.

 President Xi Jinping on Friday said the 9th Asian Winter Games embodies Asia’s shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and friendship.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a welcome banquet ahead of the Games’ opening in Harbin, he urged Asia to hold fast to the common dream of peace, respond to security challenges and contribute to building an equal and orderly multipolar world, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi urged the region to seek common progress and inject impetus into economic globalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also pledged that the Winter Asian Games held in the northeastern city will put on a spectacular sports gala which will be distinctly Chinese and uniquely Asian.
  <br>
  <br>
  International dignitaries at the banquet in the capital of Heilongjiang province included Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi noted that the Winter Games attracted a record number of countries and regions, as well as athletes.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s speed skater Sidney Chu said his team is fully ready for the Asian Winter Games which will kick off in Harbin on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city is sending more than 70 athletes to participate in the Games this year, the largest number ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old speed skater was the flag bearer for the Hong Kong, China team at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu said he will participate in eight races in speed skating and short-track speed skating this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We arrived and trained in Harbin five days ahead of the start of competition. That gives us enough time to get used to the temperature and the ice surface at the venue," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although the ice is harder than what we are used to, we have adjusted our techniques, and the way we move and our equipment. I hope we can perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chu and his teammates will also participate in the men's 5,000m relay and the mixed team 2,000m short-track speed skating relay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is the first time for SAR athletes to participate in relay races of short-track speed skating at large-scale competitions. This is a critical moment for us. I'm happy to see my team's growth and development," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The athlete said he won the support of mainland audiences at the 2022 Games, and he hopes that he will not disappoint his supporters in Harbin.

    Ohtani ex-interpreter to face nearly 5 years in jail

<img alt="Mizuhara leaving the federal court in Santa Ana, California, after pleading guilty to bank fraud and tax-evasion charges. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790636_1_20250207082110.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The former interpreter to Shohei Ohtani, who admitted stealing almost US$17 million from the Japanese baseball star to pay off illegal gambling debts, was sentenced to 57 months in prison.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ippei Mizuhara was also ordered to pay restitution of more than US$18.1 million in his sentencing in federal court in Santa Ana, California.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara pleaded guilty in June to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false tax return.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank fraud charge alone could have carried a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara was ordered to surrender to authorities on March 24. After his prison sentence, he will be subject to three years of supervised release.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sentencing by US District Judge John Holcomb caps a scandal that rocked Major League Baseball at the beginning of the 2024 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani, whose pitching and hitting skills have drawn comparisons to Babe Ruth, had signed the richest contract in North American sports history to join the Los Angeles Dodgers last December, a deal worth US$700 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara, who had worked with Ohtani while he was with the Los Angeles Angels, came with him to the Dodgers, but the team fired him last April following accusations of theft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizuhara initially said Ohtani had loaned him money to repay gambling debts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investigators found that he had stolen the money, with prosecutors saying Mizuhara siphoned millions from Ohtani to finance an "insatiable appetite" for illegal sports gambling.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an initial April court appearance, Mizuhara's lawyer said his client wished to apologize to "Ohtani, the Dodgers and Major League Baseball" and "take responsibility" for his actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors stressed throughout the case that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception and there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling. (AFP)

    Liverpool thrash Spurs to reach League Cup final

<img alt="Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk (L) after scoring his side's fourth goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790630_1_20250207071434.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool overturned a first leg deficit to reach the League Cup final with a 4-0 win and ramp up the pressure on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Dominik Szoboszlai and Virgil van Dijk were on target for the Reds, who will face Newcastle at Wembley on March 16 for the first silverware of the English season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool remain on course for a quadruple in a dream debut season for Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  They enjoy a six-point lead at the top of the Premier League, have cruised into the last 16 of the Champions League and visit Championship strugglers Plymouth in the FA cup fourth round on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we had some big nights here already but yeah to reach a final should always be special, and that is what it is," said Slot. "In Holland we only have one cup competition and that final is played at the end of the season, so it is new experience but a nice one to have."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spurs' trophy drought on the other hand goes on. Tottenham last lifted silverware in 2008 and Postecoglou now has one less opportunity to fulfil his promise of winning a trophy in his second season.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is speculation the Australian could be shown the door if another goes awry away to Aston Villa in the FA Cup at the weekend with Spurs languishing 14th in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a great opportunity and unfortunately we didn't grab it," said Postecoglou. "There's still plenty to play for us this year. We have a huge game with Villa on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having more glamorous titles to win, Slot showed his desire to make the League Cup his first trophy as Liverpool boss by naming his strongest available team bar the usual rotation in goal for cup competitions as Caoimhin Kelleher replaced Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  New signing Kevin Danso was forced straight in to Tottenham's injury-ravaged defence, while Mathys Tel also made an early debut off the bench after Richarlison hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool had scored four in each of the previous two meetings between the sides at Anfield and repeated that feat to make light of their 1-0 first leg defeat in north London last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side had taken the first quarter to find their stride but the pressure built after Szoboszlai ran offside before sweeping home Salah's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the Egyptian's next delivery into the box, Spurs did not escape as Gakpo drilled in first time to move clear as the top scorer in this season's competition with five goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Antonin Kinsky kept Salah waiting for his goal with a fine save moments later, but at the other end of the field Richarlison lay prone to leave Postecoglou's team further depleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Already without record signing Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert in attacking areas, Tottenham never looked capable of mounting the threat they needed to survive the Liverpool onslaught.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decisive blow came five minutes into the second half when Kinsky rushed off his line but was beaten to the ball by Darwin Nunez and caught the Uruguayan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah ruthlessly dispatched the resulting penalty into the top corner for his 26th goal of the season. Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch fired off the post as Liverpool put their foot down to kill the tie off.
  <br>
  <br>
  The killer third goal came 15 minutes from time when Connor Bradley, who excelled in the absence of the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold, played in Szoboszlai to slot home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Dijk then exposed Spurs' struggles defending set-pieces by heading in the fourth from a corner to rub salt in the visitors' wounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle are eying an end to their own 56-year wait for a major trophy after an impressive 4-0 humbling of Arsenal on aggregate in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Magpies have the unenviable task of stopping Slot's juggernaut if they are to do so. (AFP)

    Heat send disgruntled star Butler to Warriors: reports

<img alt="The trade ends a months-long falling out saga between the six-time NBA All-Star and the Miami Heat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790492_1_20250206110848.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The saga of star forward Jimmy Butler's falling out with the Miami Heat has reportedly ended with his trade to the Golden State Warriors ahead of the NBA trade deadline.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and The Athletic – citing unnamed team sources – reported that the Heat were finalising a deal to send Butler to the Warriors on a two-year, US$121 million extension through 2027 in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, Dennis Schroder, Kyle Anderson and a first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler and the Heat had been at odds for months. The 35-year-old was still serving his third suspension by the team "due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services."
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler, whose 17 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in 25 games this season is his lowest scoring average since the 2013 to 2014 season, had indicated in early January that he wanted to be traded, with the Heat apparently unwilling to provide the lucrative contract extension he sought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Butler arrived in Miami from Philadelphia in 2019, leading them to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023. At Golden State, he will bolster the aging star duo of Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors are currently battling for a play-in berth in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the deal came together about an hour before the Warriors took on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City, where coach Steve Kerr suddenly closed the locker room to address his players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors had reportedly expressed an interest in bringing Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant back to Golden State. Durant won NBA titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, but ESPN reported Wednesday night that he was not interested in a return to the Bay Area and it was unclear if any other move for him was imminent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Milwaukee Bucks traded All-Star forward Khris Middleton to the Washington Wizards for Kyle Kuzma, according to multiple reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal also sends forward Patrick Baldwin and a second-round 2025 NBA Draft pick while the Wizards also obtained guard A.J. Johnson and a first-round pick swap in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bucks, 26-22, made the swap with the NBA-worst Wizards to land 29-year-old forward Kuzma, who has averaged 15.2 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Middleton, 33, helped the Bucks win the NBA crown in 2021 and had been a mainstay of the team since coming over in a 2013 trade after spending his rookie campaign in Detroit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He underwent off-season surgeries on both ankles and did not make his debut this season until December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wizards made another deal, according to ESPN, sending Lithuanian centre Jonas Valanciunas to the Sacramento Kings for two second-round draft picks and 20-year-old French guard Sidy Cissoko.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kings will unite newcomers Valanciunas and Zach LaVine and try to fight into a playoff spot. They rank eighth in the Western Conference at 25-24 – the same record as Phoenix and Golden State. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NFL has announced it will stage its first-ever regular season game in Australia in the 2026 season with the Melbourne Cricket Ground hosting the contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Peter O'Reilly, head of NFL International, said the designated team in that game would be the Los Angeles Rams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game at the 100,000-capacity MCG will be part of a "multi-year" arrangement as the league continues its global expansion. O'Reilly indicated that the game could be played in Week One to allow teams plenty of time to acclimatise after the long flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL has already played regular season games in London, Munich, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, Mexico City and Toronto.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL can now schedule up to eight league-operated international regular season games per season.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the NFL has confirmed games in London, Berlin and Madrid as part of the international games slate
  <br>
  <br>
  "Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Together with the Victorian State Government, Visit Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and with the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  NFL International has an office in Australia which has been working on the deal for almost three years and there had been intense efforts from the state government to secure Melbourne as the venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're thrilled the NFL will be touching down in the sporting capital of Australia," said Premier of Victoria Jacinta Allan in the league statement. "Victoria is now the first-ever state in Australia to host a regular season NFL game."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a win for jobs, a win for businesses and a win for fans who will get to see American football played at the iconic MCG," she added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 MotoGP world champion Jorge Martin has been ruled out of the remaining pre-season testing in Malaysia and will undergo surgery in Europe after crashing badly on the opening day at the Sepang track.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard broke his hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia machine at turn two of the Sepang circuit. He had emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  He now faces a race against time to be fit for the start of his title defence in the season-opening Thailand Grand Prix on March 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jorge Martin has been diagnosed with a right hand fracture and fractures in his left foot," MotoGP organisers said in a statement. "He has undergone a CT scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), both of which were negative for any injuries."
  <br>
  <br>
  "He will stay in hospital overnight and tomorrow he will fly back to Europe to undergo surgery on his right hand and left foot."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old, who made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati, had completed 13 laps when he lost control of his new bike and was flipped high into the air.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard landed hard on his left foot before his head banged onto the asphalt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Massimo Rivola, Principal of Aprilia Racing, said he had "no explanation" for the crash and that Martin had made "no mistake".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bad crash with apparently no reason from his side and from the bike," he said. "He is a world champion, but he is also a MotoGP rider. He's not an amateur. And the bike had no problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trackhouse team rider Raul Fernandez of Spain was also ruled out of the remaining two days with hand and foot fractures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Fabio Quartararo, meanwhile, topped the timesheets on the opening day of testing with a time of 1min 57.555sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was feeling quite good. We were focused on many things to try and make a good lap time and I think I did a good job," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old Yamaha rider was fastest for most parts of Wednesday's session and claimed the fastest time on his 50th lap.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle swept into the League Cup final for the second time in three seasons with a vibrant 2-0 win against Arsenal in the semi-final second leg.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side took the lead through Jacob Murphy's first half strike at raucous St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Gordon sealed Newcastle's 4-0 aggregate victory as Arsenal paid the price for some unusually slack defending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle, who have beaten Arsenal three times this season, will face Liverpool or Tottenham in the final at Wembley on March 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham hold a 1-0 lead heading into Thursday's second leg at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having won the first leg 2-0 at Arsenal in January, Newcastle held their nerve to finish the job in front of their frenzied fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magpies are one step away from a first major trophy since winning the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe's team were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United in the 2023 League Cup final, while Newcastle have also lost the 1999, 1998 and 1974 FA Cup finals since their last silverware.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is 70 years since Newcastle lifted a major domestic trophy by winning the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finally winning a cup would be a huge moment for Newcastle, who have been transformed from serial underachievers to trophy contenders thanks to Howe's astute management and the financial backing of their Saudi owners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ironically, Newcastle have been forced to curtail their initial spending spree by profit and sustainability rules, but Howe has kept them upwardly mobile.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the high of thrashing Manchester City 5-1 in the Premier League on Sunday to keep their title challenge alive, Mikel Arteta's team came back down to earth with a bump on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta has only won the 2020 FA Cup since taking charge at Arsenal in 2019 and this was another missed opportunity to end that drought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United, the Gunners are through to the Champions League last 16 and sit six points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubbing salt into Arsenal's wounds, Newcastle fans sang "Mikel Arteta. It must the ball" in a cutting reference to the Spaniard's complaints that the different ball used in the League Cup had played a role in the first leg defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta admitted he was "disappointed" that Arsenal failed to sign a striker before the transfer window closed on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have lost Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka to long-term injuries and their lack of cutting edge was exposed in the face of Newcastle's well-drilled back five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard squandered a golden opportunity to put Arsenal ahead, blasting wildly against the post from close-range. It was a crucial miss as Newcastle punished Odegaard's profligacy in the 19th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak started the move by winning a header in front of William Saliba before breaking onto Gordon's pass into the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden striker slammed a fierce drive against the post, with the rebound falling perfectly for the Murphy to guide an agile finish into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Murphy's fifth goal in all competitions this season sparked bedlam in the stands as Newcastle started to dream of Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka had to make a good save to repel Leandro Trossard's close-range effort moments later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak, a muscular combination of power and poise, was tormenting the usually rock-solid Arsenal defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unable to cope with Newcastle's relentless high press, Arsenal were disarray at the back and it was no surprise when Gordon delivered the knockout blow in the 52nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal keeper David Raya played a poor pass to Declan Rice on the edge of the area and Fabian Schar's crunching tackle sent the ball towards Gordon, who seized the chance with a clinical finish from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gordon celebrated by holding aloft a black and white scarf thrown onto the pitch as Newcastle's party started in earnest. (AFP)

    Former tennis world number one Halep retires

<img alt="Halep after her defeat in the opening round of the Transylvania Open in Cluj-Napoca. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790293_1_20250205074433.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former tennis world number one Simona Halep announced her retirement from the sport after her first-round defeat at the WTA Cluj-Napoca tournament in her native Romania.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old lost 6-1, 6-1 to 72nd-ranked Italian Lucia Bronzetti.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know if it is with joy or sadness that I speak to you but I made this decision in my soul and conscience, I have always been lucid. My body no longer follows, but today I wanted to play and say my goodbyes on the court," Halep told the Romanian crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-time Grand Slam champion, who had been working to re-establish herself after a doping ban, pulled out of Australian Open qualifying last month citing pain in her knee and shoulder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep returned to tennis in March last year after her career had been on hold since October 7, 2022, after testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner of the 2018 French Open and 2019 Wimbledon singles titles was then caught up in a second affair, over "irregularities" in the data of her biological passport.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was handed a four-year ban by the ITIA, but successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), arguing her positive test for roxadustat – used to treat anaemia and banned as a blood doping agent – was the result of a tainted supplement.
  <br>
  <br>
  She denied knowingly doping and her ban was reduced from four years to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she never managed to regain the level that allowed her to rise to the top of the world rankings in October 2017, a position she occupied for a total of 64 weeks in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep won 24 WTA titles over her 19-year career including the French Open in 2018 and Wimbledon in 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also played in three other Grand Slam finals – the French Open in 2014 and 2017 and the Australian Open in 2018. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City signed Nico González from Porto in the biggest move from Premier League clubs on transfer deadline day, while Bayern Munich's Mathys Tel headed to Tottenham on loan.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's midfield frailties without Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, who is out for the season due to a serious knee injury, were exposed in a 5-1 thrashing at Arsenal on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men find themselves in a battle just to qualify for next season's Champions League, with the defending champions sitting fourth in the Premier League, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  City were also in need of reinforcements for a blockbuster Champions League play-off round tie against holders Real Madrid later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Barcelona midfielder González, 23, arrives for a reported fee of US$62 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the perfect opportunity for me at this stage of my career," said González. "I know the reputation Pep has and I cannot wait to work with him. In fact, I am honoured he wants me to play in his team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham were busy in the final hours of the window as they bolstered Ange Postecoglou's injury-ravaged squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tel reportedly turned down the opportunity to join Spurs earlier in the window after a deal was agreed with the German giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the French under-21 international has now moved to north London until the end of the season with an option to make the move permanent in the summer. (AFP)

<img alt="Manuel Neuer in action during a Champions League match between Bayern Munich and Slovan Bratislava. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790167_1_20250204083705.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich has announced they had extended the contract of their long-standing goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to the end of the 2025 to 2026 season.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement puts an end to speculation about Neuer's future at the Bundesliga club, where his contract was set to expire at the end of the current campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who has made over 500 appearances for the Bavarian giants, was "the best goalkeeper of his generation and a Bayern icon", sporting chief Max Eberl said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club were "delighted" that Neuer would stay on for what will be his 15th season with Bayern, after joining from domestic rivals Schalke in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer said in the statement he wanted to keep playing football and "remain a Bayern player" for the upcoming season.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 11 Bundesliga titles and two Champions League trophies with the club, Neuer said he was "still hungry" for more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, who retired from international football last year after Germany hosted the Euros, has recently returned from injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern's stalwart broke a rib in a collision in December during a match against Bayer Leverkusen, which sidelined him through the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old had previously expressed his desire to keep playing beyond the end of the year, despite growing competition for his spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Nuebel, who has a contract with Bayern until 2029 but is currently on loan at Stuttgart until 2026, is widely believed to be in line to replace Neuer in Munich. (AFP)

    Resilient Chelsea impress in comeback against West Ham

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Enzo Maresca hailed Chelsea's mental strength as they came from behind to beat West Ham 2-1 and move into fourth place in the Premier League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Maresca's side trailed to Jarrod Bowen's strike late in the first half at Stamford Bridge, sparking jeers from frustrated fans after a lethargic start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca's decision to send on Pedro Neto in the second half proved decisive as the Portugal forward bagged Chelsea's equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he has been so often over the last two seasons, Cole Palmer was the catalyst for the Blues' 74th-minute winner when his cross deflected in off West Ham defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a disappointing run of one win in seven league games, Maresca was relieved to see Chelsea get back on track in spirited fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is huge. Today was a tough game, especially mentally. When West Ham come here and sit back with 10 players behind the ball, it's not easy. You have to be mentally strong and you need to be patient," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had more than 10 shots in the first half," he added. "We had clear chances in the first half but unfortunately, we missed the target. With some changes the game changed. Overall we completely deserved to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca has been concerned that his players were distracted by speculation over potential transfers in and out of Stamford Bridge leading up to Monday's deadline day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relieved that the window would be closed, the Italian can focus on leading Chelsea's fight to qualify for next season's Champions League via a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good weekend for us in terms of results and we knew today was even better," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are there and hopefully we can be there until the end," he added. "Playing this kind of game in February, where we are still there, is an important statement." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The highly anticipated trial of Spain's disgraced former football chief Luis Rubiales over the forced kiss he gave star forward Jenni Hermoso began on Monday with the player scheduled to take the stand.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old provoked worldwide outrage after he cupped Hermoso's head and gave her an unsolicited kiss after Spain beat England to win the 2023 Women's World Cup in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors are seeking two and a half years in prison for Rubiales, one year for sexual assault for the forced kiss and 18 months for allegedly coercing Hermoso, 34, to downplay the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales and Hermoso did not greet each other as they arrived at the National Court in San Fernando de Henares near Madrid for the trial scheduled to run until February 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The kiss was given "unexpectedly and without the consent or acceptance of the player", prosecutors wrote in their indictment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Constant and repeated pressure was exerted directly on the player Jennifer Hermoso and through her family and friends with the aim of justifying and publicly approving the kiss that Luis Rubiales gave her against her will," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rubiales is scheduled to take the stand on February 12. He has called the kiss an innocuous "peck between friends celebrating" and denied any coercion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the accused alongside Rubiales are ex-women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and two former federation officials, Ruben Rivera and Albert Luque.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stand accused of trying to coerce Hermoso with prosecutors seeking 18 months' jail against them. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison has defended the jaw-dropping trade that sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, as a shell-shocked NBA struggled to comprehend the deal.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a seismic development that sent shockwaves rippling throughout the basketball world, news broke late on Saturday that the Mavs are trading away Doncic – a 25-year-old five-time All-Star – in exchange for Lakers big man Davis as part of a three-team deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extraordinary trade gives Dallas badly needed defensive heft with the acquisition of Davis, while the Lakers have at a stroke solved the riddle of how to prepare for life after LeBron James, the 40-year-old superstar who is the current face of the franchise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Davis, Doncic nor James were given advance warning that the deal was in the works, US media reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that James first learned of the deal while out for dinner in New York with his family following the Lakers' victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first reaction to the move, Doncic took to social media to thank Dallas fans and looked forward to the next phase of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought I'd spend my career here and I wanted so badly to bring you a championship," Doncic wrote in a letter to Mavs fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile saluted Davis's contribution to the Lakers in a caption over a photo of him embracing Davis on court. "Love you, my dog. Go crazy over there," James wrote, with a weeping emoji completing the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas executive Harrison defended the decision to offload Doncic amid an outcry from the franchise's fans on social media, insisting Davis's arrival could turn the Mavs into title contenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think defence wins championships and we're bringing in one of the best two-way players in the league," Harrison said. "We're excited to feel like we're built to win now as well as in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked if he could understand the frustration of fans at seeing a generational talent being traded away, Harrison said he believes such a move would help "make the organisation better".
  <br>
  <br>
  In an inauspicious start to the post-Doncic era, the Mavs were blown out 144-101 by the NBA-leading Cleveland Cavaliers to fall to 26-24 on the season. (AFP)

    Aston Villa sign Rashford on loan from Man Utd

<img alt="Marcus Rashford is now on loan to Aston Villa. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790022_1_20250203070843.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa signed Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United for the rest of the season to end the England international's exile under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.
 <br>
  <br>
  Once a hero for the United fans, Rashford has not featured for his boyhood club since December 12 and admitted earlier this season he was ready for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old had been linked with a move to AC Milan and Barcelona, but the European giants were put off by his reported US$372,000 a week wages.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Sky Sports, Villa will pick up at least 75 percent of that pay packet for the coming months, rising to 90 percent depending on performance-related bonuses and have an option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions," said Rashford in a Villa statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just want to play football and am excited to get started," he added. "I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa moved to bolster their attacking options after selling Colombia striker Jhon Duran to Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unai Emery's men have qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League and still have aspirations to qualify for that tournament again next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit eighth in the Premier League, eight points above 13th-placed United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford scored 138 goals in 426 appearances since coming through the ranks at Old Trafford and has lifted the Europa League, two FA Cups and two League Cups as a United player.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, his attitude and work ethic in training has been questioned by Amorim, since he took charge in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  After last weekend's 1-0 win at Fulham, the Portuguese coach sensationally claimed he would rather put the club's 63-year-old goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in the squad than Rashford.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our team should be so much better with Rashford, but he has to change," Amorim said last week. "If he does change, we are more than welcome to put a talent like Rashford in, and we need it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in this moment I think it's really clear that we have to set some standards. That's all."
  <br>
  <br>
  A temporary switch to Villa allows Rashford a fresh start to rehabilitate his tarnished reputation after his astonishing fall from grace.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was part of England's World Cup squad just over two years ago and scored a career-best 30 goals in the 2022 to 2023 campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he netted just eight times last season and has seven in 24 appearances so far this campaign. (AFP)

<img alt="Arsenal midfielder Martin Odegaard (L) celebrates with teammates after scoring the opening goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790019_1_20250203054822.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal beat Manchester City 5-1 to keep their Premier League title hopes alive, while Manchester United slumped to another meek 2-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace.
 <br>
  <br>
  In the battle between the top two for the past two seasons, the Gunners prevailed to move within six points of leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a great day for us, especially with the necessity that we had to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were gifted the perfect start inside two minutes as Manuel Akanji lost possession and Kai Havertz squared for Martin Odegaard to open the scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Erling Haaland headed in his 250th career club goal early in the second half to bring City level.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the defending champions are a pale shadow of their former selves this season and conceded within 105 seconds of the restart when Thomas Partey's shot deflected in off John Stones.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's happened all season, we are giving away too many things," said City manager Pep Guardiola. "You cannot lose the control, it's 95 minutes. You cannot finish in the way we played."
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly would have been suspended if his controversial red card in a 1-0 win at Wolves last weekend had not been overturned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old made the most of that reprieve by curling in Arsenal's third for his first goal for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz fired low and hard into the far corner with City cut open at will by the Arsenal counter-attack on 76 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  And another Arsenal teenager rounded off the rout when Ethan Nwaneri curled home in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves City still in fourth but now 15 points off the top and realistically dethroned after four consecutive seasons as champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean Philippe-Mateta was Palace's hero with both goals in the second half as United suffered a fifth defeat in their last six home league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory takes the Eagles above the Red Devils in the table as Oliver Glasner's side climb to 12th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three consecutive wins for United had lifted the mood around Old Trafford but it was back to square one for Ruben Amorim after another home display lacking in creativity and riddled with defensive lapses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace showed no mercy to secure the three points when Daniel Muñoz charged through the middle of the home side's defence and unselfishly squared for Mateta to knock in his sixth goal in five games. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia captain Sam Kerr is slated to face trial in London starting on Monday (February 3) on charges of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer in 2023.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea forward Kerr, one of the world's most recognisable women's soccer players and a sporting idol in her home nation, was charged in January 2024, almost a year after the incident was alleged to have occurred in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The charge relates to an incident involving a police officer on 30 January 2023 in Twickenham, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr, 31, has pleaded not guilty and the trial at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court is expected to last four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kerr is Australia's all-time top scorer. (Reuters)

    Lakers to acquire Doncic from Mavs for Davis: reports

<img alt="All-Star Anthony Davis (L) is reportedly sent to Dallas. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789981_2_20250202160700.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lakers and Mavericks on Sunday sent the NBA world into a frenzy, with multiple US media reporting that the teams had completed a trade that will send Luka Doncic to Los Angeles and Anthony Davis to Dallas.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN, which first reported the news, said while the two stars are at the center of the deal, the Lakers will also get Maxi Kleber and Markieff Morris, and the Mavericks will receive Max Christie and a 2029 first-round draft pick.
  <br>
  <br>
  The media outlet reported that the Jazz are also involved in the trade and will get Jalen Hood-Schifino and a 2025 second-round draft pick via the Los Angeles Clippers from the Lakers. Dallas is also sending a 2025 second-round selection to Utah.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that defense wins championships," Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison told ESPN. "I believe that getting an All-Defensive center and an All-NBA player with a defensive mindset gives us a better chance. We're built to win now and in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Dallas came to the Lakers offering Doncic, and Los Angeles reportedly believed that the five-time All-Star has what it takes to someday be the face of the franchise, per ESPN. For now, he will be playing alongside LeBron James, who is in his 22nd NBA season.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was not informed that such a deal was coming, and Doncic, Davis, and players and a number of coaches on both sides were also left in the dark, according to ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Doncic and Davis are currently sidelined due to injuries, as are Kleber and Hood-Schifino. Doncic hasn't played since Christmas Day due to a strained left calf, while Davis just went down on Tuesday with an abdominal muscle strain.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is no set date for Doncic's return, but when the 25-year-old first hit the shelf, the Mavericks said he would be re-evaluated in about one month. Davis will be re-evaluated sometime next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic has averaged 28.1 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists in 22 games (all starts) this season. He has played only for Dallas in his seven-year NBA career after being selected third overall by the Hawks in the 2018 draft. Atlanta sent his draft rights to the Mavericks in exchange for the draft rights to Trae Young.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old Davis has put up averages of 25.7 points, 11.9 boards, 3.4 assists and 2.1 blocks across 42 games (all starts) during the 2024-25 campaign. He is a 10-time All-Star (including this season), five-time All-NBA selection and five-time All-Defensive Team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before reports of the trade emerged, the Lakers were fifth in the Western Conference at 28-19, while the Mavericks were three spots below them in eighth at 26-23. (Reuters)

    Straka captures narrow lead at Pebble Beach

    <![CDATA[<div>
<img alt="Sepp Straka (left) fist-bumps Russell Henley during the third round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789953_1_20250202084218.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Straka birdied four of the last five holes to grab a one-stroke lead over Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry after Saturday's third round of the PGA Pebble Beach Pro-Am.
 <br>
  <br>
  The famed oceanside layout was struck by gusting winds, heavy rains and cold conditions for much of the day but Straka rallied for a two-under 70 to stand on 16-under-par 200 while McIlroy and Lowry battled through to shoot seven-under-par 65s.
  <br>
  <br>
  Austria's Straka, who stumbled out of the lead with three bogeys to start the back nine, closed his late run with a four-foot birdie putt at the par-5 18th to regain the top spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a bit of a roller coaster out there," Straka said. "Things got pretty tough. Wind. Rain. I didn't handle them too well. Struggled all day with speed on the greens because of the wind. Didn't adjust really well until the last few holes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Straka, who won his third PGA Tour title just two weeks ago at the American Express event, opened with back-to-back birdies. But his second shot at the 10th faded right over a cliff and onto the beach to start a three-bogey run.
  <br>
  <br>
  He answered with birdie putts at 14 and 15, sank a 29-foot birdie putt at the par-3 17th, then blasted out of a bunker to four feet at 18 and sank the putt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Really proud of the way I stuck it out and came back to get some birdies coming in. Hit some really big putts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time major winner McIlroy birdied three of the last four holes and 2019 British Open champion Lowry birdied three of the final five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It got really squally around seven, eight nine 10 for us. For me to play those holes at even par was huge," McIlroy said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then it started to settle and it's a little more sheltered on the back nine and it was nice to pick up a few birdies on the way in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry had seven birdies, two bogeys and an eagle but battled conditions much of the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shot a good score but it was pretty miserable out there at times," said Lowry. "It was very important to birdie the easy holes because the hard holes were really hard."
  <br>
  <br>
  England's Justin Rose and South Korea's Tom Kim each shot 68 to share fourth on 202 with Australian Cam Davis, who shot 69.
  <br>
  <br>
  Northern Ireland's McIlroy seeks his 27th career PGA Tour triumph while Irish pal Lowry seeks his fourth PGA victory and first since he and McIlroy combined for last April's pairs crown at New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's hope one of us does the business," Lowry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hopes for a rare California triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tomorrow would be big for a lot of reasons," McIlroy said. "It's exciting to try and get my first win of the season. Historically, the West Coast hasn't been that good for me. Haven't played great at this golf course."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-ranked McIlroy birdied four of the first eight holes to make his early charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  He dropped his approach inside three feet at the 15th and tapped in for birdie, then sank a 26-foot birdie putt at 16 to grab the lead alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him with a birdie putt from just inside 17 feet at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy hit the week's longest drive at the par-5 18th, 346 yards, then dropped his approach just inside 35 feet and two-putted to grab the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lowry matched him at the top again with a birdie at 18, blasting out of a greenside bunker to just outside seven feet and sinking the putt for the last of four back-nine birdies. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah scored twice to take Liverpool nine points clear at the top of the Premier League by beating Bournemouth 2-0 on Saturday, while third-placed Nottingham Forest smashed Brighton 7-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah's double took him above Frank Lampard as the sixth highest goalscorer in Premier League history with 178 goals on another significant day in the Reds' charge towards a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth had not lost in 12 games in all competitions and beaten Arsenal and Manchester City at home earlier this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cherries can count themselves unfortunate not to have extended that run as they hit the woodwork either side of half-time through Antoine Semenyo and Marcus Tavernier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth were also furious over the awarding of a penalty that opened the scoring on the half hour mark as Cody Gakpo appeared to clip his own heels as he entered the box rather than being tripped by Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  VAR did not intervene to overturn referee Darren England's original decision to point to the spot and Salah ruthlessly rifled home the resulting spot-kick for his 20th Premier League goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth pressed in vain for an equaliser after the break as the in-form Justin Kluivert missed two big chances either side of Tavernier's strike off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But one moment of magic from Salah sealed a massive three points in the title race when he cut inside onto his favoured left foot and curled into the top corner.

  "It feels good to be scoring goals, to be winning, but my main target this season is to win the Premier League with the team so we must keep going," said Salah, whose future at Anfield beyond this season remains unclear.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Arsenal have a mountain to climb if they are to rein in Arne Slot's men and host defending champions Manchester City on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest moved level on points with the Gunners thanks to a scintillating performance that blew Brighton away at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's men had been beaten 5-0 by Bournemouth last weekend but bounced back in style with Chris Wood netting a hat-trick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Morgan Gibbs-White, Neco Williams and Jota Silva were also on target for Forest after Lewis Dunk's own goal opened the floodgates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After what happened last week, the answer was good," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "You get punched, you get up - fantastic!"
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-time European champions are on course for a place in the Champions League as they opened up a six-point cushion on fifth-placed Newcastle, who blew the lead to lose 2-1 at home to Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jacob Murphy put the Magpies in front at St. James' Park, but Fulham hit back thanks to goals from Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz to climb up to ninth and within four points of the top six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton's relegation fears in their final season at Goodison Park now appear over after thrashing Leicester 4-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abdoulaye Doucoure opened the scoring after just 10 seconds as David Moyes enjoyed a third win in his first four games since returning as Everton boss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beto then took advantage of some woeful Leicester defending to score twice before half-time and Iliman Ndiaye rounded off a resounding win in stoppage time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three at Leicester's expense thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde's strike to beat Aston Villa 1-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa, who reached the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, have now failed to win seven consecutive times after a European game to dent their chances of returning to the competition next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich look doomed after Southampton ended their wait for a league win since November with a 2-1 victory at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Onuachu scored the winner three minutes from time for Saints, who are still 10 points adrift of safety, but move to with seven of second-bottom Ipswich. (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is in for an exciting year filled with major events.
 <br>
  <br>
  Writing on social media after attending the Lunar New Year Cup football match at Hong Kong Stadium on Saturday night, Chan praised both sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the Hong Kong Legends and World Legends teams had delivered entertaining games, featuring impressive goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was drawn 3-3 at full time, but the World Legends won a penalty shoot-out 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  He praised the lively atmosphere at the stadium, where around 20,000 fans turned up for the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said the game - featuring top international players and local soccer stars - was the perfect way for local and visiting soccer fans to celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Legends football team on Saturday evening did the SAR proud by holding the World Legends team to a 3-3 draw at full-time at the Hong Kong Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an entertaining encounter - littered with errors - the World Legends team had to claw their way back from 3-1 down to spare their own blushes. They went on to win the penalty shootout by 6 goals to 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li Kanglian scored the first goal for the Hong Kong Legends in the 31st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven minutes later, Ryan Giggs, who had a stellar career with Manchester United in the English Premier League, tied the score at 1-1 for the World Legends.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in first-half stoppage time, Li scored again to give the Hong Kong Legends a 2-1 lead at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 4 minutes after the break, Ju Yingzhi made it 3-1 to the Hong Kong Legends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The World Legends piled on the pressure, and in the 75th minute, Luis Garcia headed in to reduce the deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 88th minute, Garcia scored again from point-blank range, and the game went to penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams scored their first five spot-kicks and the shootout went to "sudden death." Kaka of the World Legends scored the next penalty, but Lu Junyi missed, and the World Legends took the trophy.

 Australia thrashed Sri Lanka by an innings and 242 runs on day four of the opening test in Galle on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Electing to bat, Australia amassed 654-6 declared in their first innings to take charge of the series opener at the Galle International Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  They bundled out Sri Lanka for 165 in the first innings with Matthew Kuhnemann (5-63) leading the rout on a spin-friendly track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Made to follow on, Sri Lanka were all out for 247 to succumb to their heaviest-ever Test defeat. Jeffrey Vandersay (53) was the top scorer for Sri Lanka before being the last man out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Kuhnemann took four wickets apiece.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second test begins on Thursday. (Reuters)

<img alt="Victor Wembanyama nails a three-pointer during the second half. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789894_1_20250201152458.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Victor Wembanyama scored 30 points as the San Antonio Spurs produced their highest-scoring game of the season in a 144-118 blowout against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  French prodigy Wembanyama was in superb form at both ends of the court, hauling down 14 rebounds and making six blocks while draining five-of-11 attempts from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wembanyama received plenty of scoring support from the Spurs lineup, with all of the starting five finishing with double-digit points tallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephon Castle scored 20 points while Harrison Barnes added 16, with Keldon Johnson chipping in with 24 off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo led Milwaukee's scoring with 35 points while Damian Lillard finished with 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the headlines belonged to Wembanyama, the former number 1 draft pick who once again displayed the sort of form that has earned him a call-up to next month's NBA All-Star Game in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I could feel like everybody was tired of losing," Wembanyama said afterwards. "So we didn't let go the whole game. The game was consistently hard, but there wasn't a moment where we let them go on huge runs. So I hope we can get inspired by that."
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio's caretaker head coach, Mitch Johnson, praised Wembanyama's influence in marshalling the Spurs defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought Victor was quarterbacking the defence tonight with his communication," Johnson said. "That's another level for him. He does so many tremendous plays with his talent and unique skill set. When he starts using his voice as a skill and connecting our defence as a team – it takes it to another level."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Friday, a late burst of scoring from Nikola Jokic helped the Denver Nuggets overcome a 42-point display from Tyrese Maxey to dig out a hard-earned 137-134 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on the road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Serbian star Jokic just missed out on adding to his season tally of 21 triple-doubles, finishing with 28 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds, but helped Denver get over the line by reeling off eight points late in the fourth quarter to settle a pulsating duel that saw the lead change hands no fewer than 16 times.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuggets guard Jamal Murray was in scintillating form for Denver, finishing with 31 points, while Michael Porter Jr added 24 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maxey meanwhile was left empty-handed after another talismanic performance that included making six-of-11 from beyond the arc. Guerschon Yabusele backed Maxey with 28 points, with Kelly Oubre Jr scoring 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets improved to 29-19 with the win and remain fourth in the Western Conference, nine games behind leaders Oklahoma City. Philadelphia fell to 19-28 and are sitting in 11th place in the Eastern Conference table, just outside the postseason places.
  <br>
  <br>
  In New Orleans, meanwhile, Jayson Tatum's jump shot with 0.2 seconds remaining handed the Boston Celtics a thrilling 118-116 victory over the Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum finished with 27 points while Jaylen Brown led Boston's scoring with 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Cade Cunningham poured in 40 points to inspire the Detroit Pistons to a 117-102 defeat of the Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After rattling in 18 points in the first half, Cunningham erupted for 16 in the third quarter before adding six more in the fourth as Detroit closed out the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tobias Harris added 17 points while Jalen Duren finished with 16 points, 13 rebounds and five assists for Detroit, who improved to 24-24 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrie Irving with 28 points led the scoring for Dallas, who were once again without the injured Luka Doncic. The Mavs fell to 26-23 following the loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Charlotte meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers made it two wins out of two on their three-game road trip with a 112-104 defeat of the Hornets. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Dupont marked his return to Six Nations duty in style as he underlined his billing as the ultimate all-round rugby player by helping France to a crushing 43-0 victory over Wales in Paris on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dupont missed last year's championship as he battled for a place on France's rugby sevens squad for the Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Needless to say, he made the side and duly scored a brace of tries in the final as France hit gold at their home Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  It silenced many critics who'd been quick to question the Toulouse scrum-half's decision to favour 7s over the national 15s team.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to his Olympic success Dupont last year won a French Top 14 and Champions Cup double with club Toulouse and guided France to an unbeaten November series.
  <br>
  <br>
  Against Wales on Friday, Dupont showcased the whole array of his playing abilities, from doughty defence to sniping attack, proving a thorn in the visitors' side at any opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  He darted over the tryline after taking a quick penalty early on, but was held up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defence was next, a perfectly-timed man-on-ball tackle on Nick Tompkins snuffing out a potential Welsh attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came an incredible assist, a pin-perfect cross-field kick for unmarked winger Theo Attissogbe in full play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is sublime from the world's greatest player," said BBC Radio Wales commentator Gareth Rhys Owen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont turned provider once more for Attissogbe.
  <br>
  <br>
  A smart break saw Dupont break the defensive line, stepping outside Liam Williams and throwing out a looped pass to the winger for an easy run in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are kidding me, this guy can do it all!" was Welsh radio's response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Magnifique!" retorted the French.
  <br>
  <br>
  A grubber through by Dupont almost saw left winger Louis Bielle-Biarrey threaten the line before a knock-on.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, on the stroke of half-time, Dupont showcased his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  One glance up from the base of a ruck and he threw out a 20-metre pass to Bielle-Biarrey for a simple touchdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three brilliant assists to set up three tries helped France motor into a 28-0 half-time lead, much to the delight of the Stade de France crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remarkably for Dupont, it was his 37th try assist in 56 Test matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the second time he's managed a hat-trick of try assists in a Six Nations match, after having four against Italy in 2021. It took Dupont to 20 assists in the Championship, with only veteran Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray having more.
  <br>
  <br>
  Linking up with Toulouse teammate Romain Ntamack, making his first France start in 17 months after a string of injuries, Dupont thrived, with Thomas Ramos also linking in well from full-back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont's run-out came to an end as France coach Fabien Galthie made six replacements in the 49th minute, eager to keep his star player's powder dry for sterner challenges to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We adapted to their defence, we put pressure on them, we adapted to what they offered us," Dupont said of the Welsh.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the players we have, we were able to have the extra man right away and we were able to have answers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Turning to an away trip against England next weekend, Dupont said: "They've had some complicated results, they lost some of their matches in November, but we will take the games one by one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have a squad which is gaining momentum. We know what it is like to go and play at Twickenham. But the Championship is long, it was important to start well today." (AFP)

 Reigning champions Real Madrid will face 2023 winners Manchester City in the plum tie of the play-off round of this season's Champions League, following Friday's draw.
 <br>
  <br>
  It is the fourth year running in which the sides have been drawn against each other in a knockout tie, with Real emerging victorious in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  City, who scraped through after finishing 22nd in the league phase in this first season of the new format for Europe's elite club competition, will be at home in the first leg before going to Spain for the return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Celtic will face six-time European champions Bayern Munich, after the Scottish champions reached the knockout stage for the first time in 12 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paris Saint-Germain will play surprise package Brest in an all-French tie, while Juventus play PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord take on AC Milan in two ties between former winners of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last season's Europa League winners Atalanta, who finished one place outside the top eight which offered a direct path to the last 16, will face Club Brugge of Belgium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sporting of Portugal were drawn against last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund, while Monaco will take on Benfica having lost at home to the Portuguese club in the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The play-off ties will take place next month, with the eight winners going through to the last 16 along with the eight highest-placed sides from the league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa are the sides already through to the last 16. (AFP)
