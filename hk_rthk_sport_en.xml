  <div class="itemFullText">
   Valencia will not host the final MotoGP of the season organisers announced on Friday, owing to the devastating flooding in the east of Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The race was due to be held on November 17 and a new venue will be "confirmed as soon as possible" said organisers in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the top MotoGP riders had called for the race to be moved away from Valencia after the devastating floods which have killed at least 205 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Floods devastated towns, piling up cars collapsing bridges and filling streets with mud in Spain's biggest such disaster for decades.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have been in constant contact with the local authorities and the circuit to best assess how we can help and how we should proceed," said MotoGP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After carefully weighing up the potential positive impact of MotoGP racing in Valencia on delayed dates versus ensuring no single resource is diverted from the recovery efforts by the presence of MotoGP, the championship and local authorities have been obliged to cancel the 2024 Valencia GP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In lieu of racing in Valencia, MotoGP will instead race for Valencia... the championship will put our collective efforts behind backing the relief funds already in place."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The penultimate race takes place in Malaysia this weekend with Spaniard Jorge Martin top of the standings, ahead of Italy's Francesco Bagnaia, who won the 2023 championship in Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both riders backed a move away from Valencia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Primac Ducati rider Martin on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct... this could be wrong to race there," said Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish reports said the Ricardo Tormo racetrack was not affected by the flooding but infrastructure around it was.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other sporting events in the region, including La Liga champions Real Madrid's visit to face Valencia due to take place on Saturday, have been postponed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is not the first time that top level motor sport in Europe has been cancelled because of flooding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 2023 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in Imola, Italy, was cancelled by Formula One organisers after flooding in the region. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ruben Amorim was on Friday named as the new manager of Manchester United, replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old Portuguese coach, who won two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon, has signed a deal until 2027 and will join the club on November 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Ruben Amorim as head coach of the men's first team, subject to work visa requirements," the club said on its website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He will join until June 2027 with a club option of an additional year, once he has fulfilled his obligations to his current club."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United described Amorim as "one of the most exciting and highly rated young coaches in European football."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ruud van Nistelrooy will continue to take charge of the team until Amorim arrives at Old Trafford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United sacked Ten Hag on Monday after a 2-1 defeat by West Ham left them languishing 14th in the Premier League, with just three wins from nine matches. (AFP)

    Morant leads Grizzlies over Bucks, Rockets hold on

  <img alt="Grizzlies' Morant drives the ball against Bucks guard Damian Lillard. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777176_1_20241101123409.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ja Morant's 12th career triple-double fired the Memphis Grizzlies to a 122-99 NBA victory over the reeling Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday as Houston edged the Dallas Mavericks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but teammate Damian Lillard was held to four points on 1-of-12 shooting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook Lopez was Milwaukee's next-highest scorer with 12 points as the Bucks dropped their fourth straight after opening the season with a win over injury-hit Philadelphia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morant was the engine, scoring 26 points with 10 rebounds and 14 assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just came out being aggressive, took what the defense gave me," said Morant, who piled up 21 points in the first half to help Memphis build a 70-48 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had plenty of support as seven Grizzlies players, including all five starters, scored in double figures. Milwaukee never got the deficit below 18 points in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Everybody was kind of in a good rhythm, we got it going early," Morant said after Memphis bounced back from a lethargic loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We got stops," he said. "We were boxing out, we were getting out running, playing our game – that's how we want to play. If we want to do something in this league, that's what we've got to do each and every night."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Bucks are clearly missing the contribution of injured Khris Middleton, who has yet to play this season as he recovers from an ankle injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I thought we played with the right spirit," Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. "We didn't make shots and you're going to have nights like that. But on those nights we have to find a way to get stops.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Morant had a free pass tonight as far as driving – we've got to do a better job of trying to figure out how to contain guards like that," Rivers said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, in Dallas, the Rockets finally got the better of their Texas rivals, leading by as many as 23 points and hanging on for a 108-102 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Green scored 23 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for the Rockets, who had lost six of their last seven games against the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Green scored 11 in the fourth quarter to help the Rockets fend off a late Dallas surge. Dillon Brooks and Alperen Sengun added 17 points apiece for Houston, who out-rebounded Dallas 50-37.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mavs star Luka Doncic scored 15 of his 29 points in the final period, his step back three-pointer with 1:08 remaining pulling Dallas within three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amen Thompson and Brooks responded with baskets and the Rockets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 28 points for the Mavs, but Klay Thompson was the only other Dallas player to score in double figures with 12. (AFP)

    Yao Ming steps down as Chinese basketball chief

  <img alt="The CBA confirmed it had approved Yao's resignation. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777150_1_20241101102242.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   NBA legend Yao Ming has quit as head of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) after seven years in the job because of the national team's poor performances, he said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Basketball is immensely popular in China and the former Rockets centre is the country's most famous star, even after he retired from playing in 2011.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao told state news agency Xinhua that he was standing down because "the performances and results of the national team have regrettably not met expectations".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 44-year-old has previously been critical of the men's national team, labelling the players "slackers" and warning there was a "huge gap" between them and the world's best teams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said last year he would "take responsibility" after they failed to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA confirmed it had approved his resignation on Thursday, saying his decision came "after careful consideration and based on considerations for the development of China's basketball and personal planning".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He has chosen to depart with about two years left on his term to allow the association a full Olympic cycle to improve the team, Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A CBA statement quoted Yao as saying that "basketball is a career I have always adored, whether in the past, present or future".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope that everyone will continue to support Chinese basketball with me in the future," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CBA said the national sport administration "expressed sincere gratitude" to Yao for his work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is believed that Yao Ming has done a lot of fruitful work in building the foundation of bringing basketball to the masses – and improving the level of the national team", the association said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yao "is still a member of the Chinese basketball family and we believe he will continue to contribute to Chinese basketball", it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His successor, Guo Zhenming, pledged to deepen reforms in the domestic game and help China become a basketball heavyweight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Taking the baton of leading the CBA is a heavy responsibility and a glorious mission," Guo was quoted as saying. (AFP)

    Top MotoGP riders want Valencia race moved

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Leading MotoGP riders called Thursday for the season finale in a fortnight to be moved out of Valencia because of deadly once-in-a-generation flooding in Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At least 95 people have been killed and troops, police and firefighters are racing to find survivors and victims in the Valencia region of the country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The MotoGP world title could go down to the final race weekend of the campaign, scheduled for the Circuit Ricardo Tormo just outside Valencia on November 16-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day, I think the best solution will be to race elsewhere," said Spain's Jorge Martín, who tops the championship ahead of Italy's title-holder Francesco Bagnaia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking in Sepang ahead of this weekend's Malaysia GP, the 26-year-old called on the sport's bosses to make a decision on a possible change of venue as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The best thing would be to know right now so you approach the weekend in a different way," said the Pramac Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Title rival Bagnaia, who is still in the fight just 17 points back, said the Spanish people "are living their worst dream".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Knowing the situation as it is, it's not correct – this could be wrong to race there. If it was my choice, I'd prefer not to race there. We have many other options," said the Ducati rider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Valencia track itself has not been damaged but there are question marks about some of the other infrastructure needed to host thousands of fans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Márquez said the priority must be the recovery effort and not racing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Up to a year's rain fell in a few hours on the eastern city of Valencia and the surrounding region on Tuesday, sending torrents of water and mud through towns and cities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As a Spaniard, it's super-difficult to see these kinds of images," said Márquez. "Theorically, we have a GP there – but now I think all the facilities of the government, of Spain, need to go to the people who lost their houses."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain on Thursday started three days of mourning. (AFP)

    Alcaraz stunned by 18th-seed Humbert at Paris Masters

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number two Carlos Alcaraz was knocked out of the Paris Masters by 18th-ranked Ugo Humbert of France who swept to a third round victory in three sets on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Left-handed Humbert came through 6-1, 3-6, 7-5 to register his first win over the French Open and Wimbledon champion having lost twice to the Spanish star earlier in 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a testing evening for Alcaraz who was 0-5 down in the first set before he managed to get on the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just super proud of myself that I did it," said Humbert who has won titles in Marseille and Dubai this season. "It was a crazy match, a crazy atmosphere."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went for every shot," added Humbert, looking back on his first set blitz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's why I think I had less energy in the second set, and after the third it was a mountain that was with me to the end," he said. "I trusted myself in big moments and I made some big shots."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Alcaraz has endured a rollercoaster second half of the season since his heartbreaking Paris Olympics final loss to Novak Djokovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a very intense match," admitted Alcaraz. "I started with some doubts about my game. Against a player who attacks whenever he can, who hits very aggressively at the slightest opportunity, it wasn't easy to get into the match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was not up to the level he displayed," he added. "Ugo's performance was really high – the way he hits the ball is incredible."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcraz was knocked out in the second round of the US Open by 74th-ranked Botic van de Zandschulp, and defeated top-ranked Jannik Sinner in the Beijing final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He then suffered a quarter-final exit at the hands of Tomas Machac, the world number 33, at the Shanghai Masters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Humbert goes on to face Australia's Jordan Thompson for a place in the Paris Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French number one just edged Alcaraz in winners on Thursday with 28 to 23 with both men committing 38 unforced errors. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Snooker superstar Ronnie O’Sullivan has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, the Immigration Department said on social media on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old, known as the Rocket for his fast and attacking playing style, said he enjoyed his time in the SAR in the past and his sport is very popular in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan also said it’s a great place to live because of the food, culture and a low tax regime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My plan in Hong Kong is, obviously, here to do some work. But I love the food. I love to just, relax here in Hong Kong," he said in a video clip on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Maybe I'm going to play some snooker, just see some friends maybe. It's just really nice to be back in Hong Kong again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   O'Sullivan, currently ranked fifth in the world, won the Hong Kong Snooker Masters two years ago, saying at the time that he enjoyed the hiking trails in the city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His decision to obtain Hong Kong residency comes after a similar move last year by retired basketball star Stephon Marbury, whose playing career spanned over two decades in the National Basketball Association in the US and the Chinese Basketball Association.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Los Angeles Dodgers produced a stunning fightback to defeat the New York Yankees and clinch the World Series on Wednesday with a dramatic come-from-behind 7-6 victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a night of spellbinding drama at Yankee Stadium, the Dodgers sealed their second Major League Baseball championship crown in five seasons and eighth overall after recovering from 5-0 down to complete a 4-1 series victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, who had kept the series alive with an 11-4 rout in game four on Tuesday, had looked poised to take the series back to Los Angeles for game six after home runs from Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm and Giancarlo Stanton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees starter Gerrit Cole meanwhile produced a masterful performance from the mound to keep the Dodgers' potent offensive line-up scoreless through four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a catastrophic fifth inning by the Yankees, which included a litany of defensive errors, saw the Dodgers pile on five unearned runs to tie the score at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Yankees regained the lead through a Stanton sacrifice-fly in the sixth inning, the Dodgers hit back in the eighth with sac-flys of their own from Gavin Lux and Mookie Betts to claim what turned out to be a winning 7-6 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers then brought back game three starter Walker Buehler to bag the final three outs in the ninth to clinch victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Obviously we're resilient, but there's so much love in this clubhouse, care – that care won this game today," said Dodgers star Betts. "That's what it was. It was love, it was grit – it was just a beautiful thing and I'm just proud of us and I'm happy for us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Buehler, meanwhile, admitted he had not been expecting to play a part in the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wish I was in a little better shape so my heart could have handled it better," the Dodgers pitcher said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Dodgers star Freddie Freeman, who blasted four consecutive home runs in the opening four games of the series, was named Series Most Valuable Player.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we were all saying the first three innings – 'let's just get one, just chip away, we can do this,'" said Freeman, who drove in two runs in the fifth inning rally with a single. "There's a couple of mistakes that happened, you've got to capitalise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers had gone into Wednesday's game quietly confident, with victorious game one starter Jack Flaherty back on the mound.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Flaherty's eve-of-Halloween outing turned into a horror show as the revived Yankees bats cut loose to leave the Dodgers reeling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and then Chisholm followed it with a solo shot to put the Yankees 3-0 ahead, before Alex Verdugo drove in a run for Anthony Volpe to make it 4-0 in the second, prompting Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to remove Flaherty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stanton's third inning solo home run made it a five-run game but after that dream start, the wheels fell off in the fifth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enrique Hernandez launched the Dodgers rally with a single to lead off the inning and then Tommy Edman was given a reprieve when Judge flubbed a catch in center-field that left the Dodgers with two men on base and no outs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a terrible mix-up between Cole and first baseman Anthony Rizzo allowed Betts to single and score Hernandez to make it 5-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman then took full advantage, doubling to score Edman and Will Smith to make it 5-3 with runners on first and third. Teoscar Hernandez then drove a double to center-field to bring in two more runs and the game was suddenly tied at 5-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Dodgers conjured another rally, with Lux and Betts bagging sac-flys to snatch a one-run lead at 7-6, leaving Buehler to close out victory in the ninth. (AFP)

    Lakers fall to Cavs as Bronny scores first NBA bucket

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   It was a homecoming for Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James on Wednesday, as his son Bronny secured his first-ever NBA career bucket in their team's 134-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the 39-year-old Lakers superstar watched from the bench, Bronny James scored his first points in an NBA game on a shot that looked just like his old man.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second game featuring a father-son duo, LeBron checked out in the fourth quarter and sat back to enjoy seeing his son soak in the love of a Cleveland crowd that cheered his every move for 11 seasons.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the Cavs on their way to the blowout victory, Cleveland fans began chanting “We want Bronny!”, hoping to see the rookie they watched grow up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The younger James checked in with 5:16 left and was cheered every time he touched the ball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He picked up two assists and then made his first basket as a pro on a 14-foot shot from the left corner with 2:03 left, triggering a huge ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland took control with a red-hot first quarter, connecting on 77.3 percent of their shots from the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Cavs led by 19 at halftime and turnovers doomed the Lakers' efforts to make significant inroads in the third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James led the Lakers with 26 points. Anthony Davis added 22 with 13 rebounds but Los Angeles dropped their second straight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Lakers head coach J.J. Redick had high praise for Bronny despite the loss.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I told him congratulations,” he said. “It's a big deal to score your first NBA points, and the fact he did it back here in Cleveland was a bright spot.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   When Bronny was little, he ran through the hallways, rode the elevators and took shots or played pickup on the practice court inside Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse – all while his famous father played in games for the Cavaliers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in the day, Bronny reflected on his Ohio homecoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s going to be real special,” he said following the morning shootaround. “It feels good to be out here with my dad – in our home.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron spent 11 seasons over two stints with the Cavs, leading them to the 2016 title before leaving as a free agent two years later. Last week, the 39-year-old superstar and his 20-year-old son became the first father-son duo to play in an NBA game. (AP/AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two New York Yankees fans who interfered with Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts as he tried to make a catch were barred from Wednesday's fifth game of the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees announced hours before the crucial clash in New York that the spectators, who were seated in the from row along the wall in foul territory in right field, were ejected after trying to block the player and take the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The incident happened in the first inning of New York's 11-4 victory, which lifted the Yankees within 3-1 in Major League Baseball's best-of-seven championship showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Last night, two fans were ejected from Yankee Stadium for egregious and unacceptable physical contact with Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts," the Yankees said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The safety and security of players, fans and stadium staff is the foundational element of every event held at Yankee Stadium," it added. "It cannot be compromised."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however the exuberance of supporting one's team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk," the statement went on to say.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Yankees and Major League Baseball maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of behavior displayed last night – these fans will not be permitted to attend tonight's game in any capacity."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts tried to make a grab off a ball hit by New York's Gleyber Torres but as he leaped above the wall in foul territory, one fan grabbed his right hand and the other pulled the ball from his glove.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Torres was called out due to fan interference on the play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've never seen anything like it," said Dodgers starting pitcher Ben Casparius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That looked ridiculous from my perspective," Dodgers shortstop Tommy Edman said. "The guy was trying to yank his glove off, pulling at his wrist. Looked like he got ejected and I'm glad he did. I've never seen anything like that – that was unacceptable." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Daniil Medvedev is still searching for his first ATP tournament victory this year after the world number five lost to Australia's Alexei Popyrin for the first time in his career at the Paris Masters on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev won the Paris title in 2020 but has not found the indoor tournament to his liking in recent years – the defeat to Popyrin is the third successive time he has gone out in his opening round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin, who has been on a rich vein of form this year winning his first Masters tournament in Montreal in August and beating Novak Djokovic in the US Open, edged Medvedev 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a gripping second round match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Popyrin, ranked 24 in the world, it was only his third win over a player in the top five.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is the first time I have beaten him," said Popyrin. "We have had some right old battles in the past and it is a real pleasure to have performed like this this time round."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Popyrin will next play Karen Khachanov after the Russian downed France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (12/14), 6-1, 6-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev, who has already qualified for the season-ending ATP Tour Finals next month, fought back twice in the deciding set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He came back from 4-1 down to force a tie-break and then trailing 4-1 in that he levelled at 4-4.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, with Popyrin leading 5-4, Medvedev double-faulted giving the 25-year-old Australian two match points and he wasted no time in sealing the victory on the first one. (AFP)

    'Sports arbitration system to settle disputes quickly'

  <img alt="A veteran arbitrator says a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve disputes such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776876_1_20241030170539.jpg&q=75" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A legal expert on Wednesday said the government's plan to establish a new sports arbitration resolution mechanism will help resolve issues such as the Messi no-show saga more quickly and amicably.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thousands of fans were left angry and disappointed after Argentinian superstar Lionel Messi sat out an Inter Miami football match in the SAR back in February, triggering complaints and calls for ticket refunds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nicholas Chan, who heads the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre, said such situations could be eased with the new mechanism in place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In Hong Kong, we don't have class action for litigation. And even if we had class action, it's not cheap for thousands of ticket holders to launch a dispute," he told RTHK.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We could resolve everything quickly by mediation, if not by arbitration. So it saves all the parties the headache of having to try to find the proper forum for dispute, spend a lot of money on resolving disputes by going to courts or otherwise."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International sports arbitration is dominated by Western countries, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland a prominent example.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But the official working language is French, Spanish, or English. You don't really have much of a choice to use Chinese, Malay, Arabic, or other languages very common in the developing world. So it is not ideal to spend a lot of time and cost where it could be resolved more cost-effectively," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The plan is also seen as an opportunity for retired athletes to pursue a second career in sports mediation and arbitration, Chan added.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Anthony Volpe smashed a grand slam as the New York Yankees avoided being swept in the World Series on Tuesday with an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Volpe's third-inning home run gave the Yankees a 5-2 edge, their first lead since game one, and later homers by Gleyber Torres and Austin Wells sparked New York's rout.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees pulled within 3-1 in the best-of seven Major League Baseball championship showdown with game five on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series, but the Yankees became the first team in 54 years to force a fifth game when down 0-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York denied the Dodgers an eighth World Series title and first since 2020 while keeping alive hopes of the Yankees winning their first crown since 2009 and 28th overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a record-shattering night for Los Angeles first baseman Freddie Freeman, who smashed a two-run homer in the first inning to become the first player with homers in the first four games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who blasted a walk-off grand slam to win game one, also moved past George Springer to set a record with homers in six consecutive World Series contests, counting the last two games from his 2021 title run with Atlanta. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Premier League strugglers Southampton squeezed into the English League Cup quarter-finals when James Bree struck a late winner to down Championship side Stoke 3-2 on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And another Premier League team, Brentford, also survived a major scare against second-tier rivals, beating Sheffield Wednesday on penalties.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At St Mary's, Southampton were sailing into the next round after Taylor Harwood-Bellis' header and Adam Armstrong's spot-kick inside 35 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But goals from Ashley Phillips and Tom Cannon threatened to force a penalty shoot-out until defender Bree rifled home from 25 yards with two minutes left on the clock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Southampton were fortunate to reach that stage still level as only a goal-line clearance from Yukinari Sugawara stopped Stoke substitute Million Manhoef completing the turnaround minutes earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saints boss Russell Martin, who was serving a touchline ban after collecting a third booking of the campaign, made six changes to the starting XI which began Saturday's 1-0 loss at Manchester City, leaving the team footing the table with a solitary point from nine outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the night's other encounter, Brentford were bossing the show against Sheffield Wednesday after taking the lead through Kevin Schade in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Wednesday levelled shortly before the hour with their first effort on target through Djeidi Gassama's spectacular strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford could not find a winner in normal time with Mark Flekken their hero, the goalkeeper saving Liam Palmer's penalty to send the hosts through 5-4 after a 1-1 draw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I went to the wrong side twice at the start of the shoot-out," commented Flekken. "That doesn't help your confidence in a shoot-out but luckily I saved the last one".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Holders Liverpool are away to Brighton on Wednesday with beaten finalists Chelsea at Newcastle. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Qatar's Akram Afif was named Asian Football Confederation men's player of the year on Tuesday, while Japan's Kiko Seike took home the women's award.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Afif led Qatar to the Asian Cup title at the start of the year, being named player of the tournament and winning the golden boot with eight goals – including a hat-trick against Jordan in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second time the 27-year-old had been named Asian player of the year. He also won the prize in 2019 after winning the Asian Cup with Qatar for the first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif, who had stints in Belgium and Spain earlier in his career, also led club side Al Sadd to a domestic double in Qatar.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to thank my wife, teammates and all the national team coaches and administrative staff," he said at the AFC award ceremony in Seoul. "I will try my best to win this award for a third time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afif became the third player to win the award more than once, following in the footsteps of Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata and Uzbekistan's Server Djeparov.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seike won the women's prize after scoring 20 goals to help Urawa Red Diamonds Ladies win the Japanese domestic title for a second straight year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forward Seike was also influential as Urawa won the Asian club title, and was part of the Japan squad that reached the quarter-finals at the Paris Olympics.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very happy to receive this prestigious award," said Seike, who joined England's Brighton in July. "I will continue to do my best for my club, the national team and to raise the value of Asian football." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Spain's Carlos Alcaraz opened his campaign at the Paris Masters on Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Chilean Nicolas Jarry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After receiving a bye through the first round, Alcaraz took a 3-0 lead in his round of 32 match but was reigned back in by Jarry, before eventually claiming the first set 7-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Alcaraz was in commanding form in the second set, giving his Chilean opponent only one game as he raced to victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's been two years since I have won a match here in Paris – so every time that I keep going is a gift for me," said the 21-year-old Spaniard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really happy to get through the opening set, it was really important for me to come into the second with more confidence," he added. "I need time to get used to the speed of the court."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz is now the heavy favourite to win his first title on the hard court at Bercy Arena after Italian world number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the tournament earlier on Tuesday due to an intestinal virus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He will face either Frenchman Ugo Humbert or American Marcos Giron in the round of 16. (AFP)

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776665_1_20241029120646.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman homered for a record-tying third consecutive game and the Los Angeles Dodgers reached the brink of a World Series title by beating the New York Yankees 4-2 on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, who smashed a walk-off grand slam to win the opener in Los Angeles, crushed a two-run homer in the first inning and Walker Buehler threw five shutout innings allowing only two hits to spark the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gives the Dodgers a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven Major League Baseball championship series, meaning they can capture their first crown since 2020 by winning game four on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   No team has ever recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman matched Hank Bauer in 1958 and Barry Bonds in 2002 as the only players to homer in the first three games of a World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers first baseman also matched George Springer's record of homers in five consecutive World Series contests, including the last two games of Freeman's 2021 title run with Atlanta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not been swept in a World Series since Cincinnati did it in 1976. The most recent World Series sweep was by San Francisco over Detroit in 2012.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers seek their eighth World Series title while the Yankees, with a record 27 crowns, chase their first World Series title since 2009.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's the 12th title showdown between two of baseball's most iconic teams, with the Yankees having beaten the Dodgers eight times and the Dodgers defeating New York three, including a 1963 sweep. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paolo Banchero had the best night of his career on Monday night, tying the Orlando Magic record for points in a half – scoring 37 in the first two quarters against the Indiana Pacers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He finished with a career-high 50 points to equal the fifth-highest scoring effort in Magic history. Orlando won 119-115.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Man, I'm tired.” Banchero said after the first 50-point effort in the NBA this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero, the league's rookie of the year two seasons ago and an All-Star last year, was 13 of 17 from the field in the half and finished 16 of 26 from the floor. He also had 13 rebounds and nine assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It was just being in the zone,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Felt like I was in an open gym, back at home, just working on my game," he added. "Every shot felt like it was going in, and it's a good feeling when you've got a day like that. Not every game is going to be like that – but I'm glad today was.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37 points in the half tied the mark set by NBA legend Tracy McGrady, also in the first half, for Orlando against Washington in the game where he finished with 62.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That first half was a magical first half, for sure,” Banchero said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Banchero's career-high entering Monday was 43 points, set January 3 against Sacramento. (AP)

    Rodri wins men's Ballon d'Or as Real Madrid boycott

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri was awarded the men's Ballon d'Or on Monday after winning a fourth consecutive Premier League title and Euro 2024, but Real Madrid boycotted the ceremony.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The decision to award the prize for the world's best player to the deep-lying midfielder came as a surprise, with Real Madrid's Liga and Champions League double winner Vinicius Junior widely seen as the pre-ceremony favourite.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hours before the festivities in Paris, the Spanish club announced its delegation would not attend the ceremony at Chatelet Theatre because of what it perceived as a snub of Vinicius.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodri, 28, played a key role as City held off Arsenal to win the Premier League title last season and was named player of the tournament at Euro 2024 as unfancied Spain emerged triumphant in Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite the French organisers insisting that the identity of the winner was a closely-guarded secret this year, the news appeared to have leaked with Madrid announcing hours before the ceremony they would not attend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Barcelona and Spain star Aitana Bonmati earlier won her second successive women's Ballon d'Or, after leading her club to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claiming the Nations League with her country.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drama started hours before the ceremony as Spanish and European champions Real said if Vinicius was not the winner, then the award should go to his teammate Dani Carvajal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Like the Brazilian, Carvajal scored in the 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final at Wembley.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If the award criteria doesn't give it to Vinicius as the winner, then those same criteria should point to Carvajal as the winner," Real Madrid told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As this was not the case, it is clear that Ballon d'Or and Uefa does not respect Real Madrid – Real Madrid does not go where it is not respected."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Madrid contingent of nominees also included Kylian Mbappé, Antonio Rudiger, Fede Valverde and Jude Bellingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the Ballon d'Or is chosen from the shortlist by an international jury of 100 specialist journalists. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United have sacked manager Erik ten Hag, the Premier League club said on Monday, with the Old Trafford side 14th in the standings after nine games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men’s first-team manager," the club said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ruud van Nistelrooy will take charge of the team as interim head coach, supported by the current coaching team, whilst a permanent head coach is recruited."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 54-year-old Dutchman's job was the subject of speculation for most of last season as United recorded their worst Premier League finish in eighth, and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A surprise FA Cup final win over Manchester City, however, plus the fact Ten Hag was able to blame numerous injuries for their poor form earned Ten Hag another chance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He signed a new contract to extend his stay until 2026 and get another chance to restore the 20-times English league champions to former glories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Early results this season, however, suggested Ten Hag was not going to achieve that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But according to multiple British media reports, United will turn to Amorim, the 39-year-old Sporting Lisbon manager who is considered one of Europe's leading young coaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Sports reported United were prepared to pay Amorim's release clause.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Amorim was linked with the manager's role at Liverpool following the departure of Jurgen Klopp this year, but Dutch coach Arne Slot headed to Anfield instead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The position of Ten Hag, 54, had been repeatedly called into question after United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe kept him on board following an internal review at the end of last season when the club finished eighth in the Premier League but won the FA Cup with a shock victory over Manchester City.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was even rewarded with a one-year extension of his contract to June 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But United have shown little improvement this season and the 2-1 loss at West Ham was the final straw.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Erik ten Hag has left his role as Manchester United men's first-team manager," a statement by United read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are grateful to Erik for everything he has done during his time with us and wish him well for the future," it added. (Reuters/AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   South Korean phenom Tom Kim on Monday said he is feeling confident ahead of his return to the Link Hong Kong Open in November, for the first time since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim was speaking to reporters on the heels of a nail-biting defeat to compatriot An Byeong-hun at the 2024 Genesis Championship in Incheon on Sunday, a loss which he is hoping to use as motivation for the SAR tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Link Hong Kong Open, which will be staged for a 63rd time at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 21 to 24, is set to feature a star lineup with the likes of Englishman Justin Rose, who won in 2015.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm not thinking too much ahead of myself. I think that's the biggest thing," said the world number 25 – who last year became the youngest golfer since Tiger Woods to land three PGA Tour titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Golf is golf – anything can happen. Just because you're the highest-ranked player in the world, it doesn't always mean you're going to get the win."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 22-year-old, who already has two Asian Tour titles to his name, said he remains unfazed by the pressure, as he begins training to improve on his previous showing in the SAR when he finished 18th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Seoul-born athlete also shared how looking past the burden of growing expectations has helped him navigate the many challenges of his golf career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Looking at my career from the very beginning, I've always had steps that I've grown into," Kim said. "And over the past year, there've been times where I've felt stuck."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So long as I take these hits and learn from them, I can be humble and grateful for when good moments do come," he added.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Washington rookie Jayden Daniels completed a stunning 52-yard touchdown pass on Sunday's final play to give the Commanders a shocking 18-15 victory over Chicago while the NFL champion Kansas City Chiefs stayed unbeaten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, questionable until game time with a rib injury, scrambled to evade defenders then hurled the ball half the field to the goal line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bears defender Tyrique Stevenson tipped it from among a pack of players and into the end zone, where Noah Brown caught it for an astonishing "Hail Mary" game-winning touchdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was juiced up for sure. It was exciting," Daniels said. "That's like a once-in-a-lifetime experience – that was my first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just threw the ball up," he added. "I didn't see anything. I just heard people screaming and our sidelined rushing the field – that's how I knew."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Daniels, who completed 21-of-38 passes for 326 yards, called it a miraculous play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At Las Vegas, Patrick Mahomes threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to spark the unbeaten Chiefs over the host Raiders 27-20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chiefs became the seventh reigning Super Bowl champion to start the next campaign 7-0, the first since New England in 2019. Only Denver in 1998 managed to win another title after those starts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We played a pretty good game," Mahomes said. "We're building and going in the right direction."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the NFL's play of the season was by Daniels, who was feeling rib pain near the end of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's tough when you've got to throw the ball, have to rotate with it," Daniels said. "I started the game. I wanted to finish it – nothing was going to take me out of the game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders grabbed a 12-0 lead but Chicago seized the lead on a touchdown with 23 seconds remaining, only to fall on an incredible play.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's a hard way to lose," Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. "I've got to look at it, detail it out, and make sure we're better next time."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commanders stayed atop the NFC East at 6-2. Chicago fell to 4-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brown was overjoyed after catching the NFL's first go-ahead "Hail Mary" touchdown pass in the last 10 seconds of a game since 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got a team full of fighters," Brown said. "We don't give up until the final whistle. "Just try and get down there as fast as you can, get good position, hope Jayden can get the ball down there." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Sainz cruised to an emotional victory for Ferrari ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris in Sunday's incident-filled Mexico City Grand Prix as Red Bull's series leader Max Verstappen was handed two 10-second penalties on his way to sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The stewards took a dim view of Verstappen's aggressive driving, the Red Bull driver twice forcing his title rival Norris off the track.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris grabbed second from Charles Leclerc in the other Ferrari near the finish as the Briton enjoyed a major boost in his quest to deny Verstappen a fourth consecutive world championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The McLaren driver cut 10 points off the gap to Verstappen which now stands at 47 with four race weekends remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I knew what to expect from Max," Verstappen said, speaking on the heavy price for his show of ruthlessness. "I respect him a lot as a driver and I expected it but it was not very clean driving in my opinion."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the second week in succession that the two title-chasers had clashed following a penalty for Norris at the United States Grand Prix. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester United's under-fire manager Erik ten Hag said he could only fault his side's finishing after a damaging 2-1 defeat for the Dutchman at struggling West Ham on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United slipped to 14th in the Premier League table after Jarrod Bowen's controversial stoppage time penalty winner handed the Hammers all three points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Crysencio Summerville put West Ham in front against the run of play 16 minutes from time before Casemiro equalised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag was furious at the award of the spot-kick after VAR intervened when Matthijs de Ligt clashed with Danny Ings inside the box.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United captain Bruno Fernandes had a red card rescinded after being sent-off in a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham last month and Ten Hag highlighted the inconsistency of when VAR decides to challenge the referee's on-field decision.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Before the season they explained the process of VAR – only when it is clear and obvious they should interfere," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What they didn't do against Spurs, that was a wrong decision," he added. "Now they make a wrong decision interfering and both have big impact on the games. I don't criticise the personnel, I criticise the process."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, it was a familiar lack of wastefulness in front of goal that cost United a much-needed victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diogo Dalot missed an open goal, while Alejandro Garnacho and Fernandes were also guilty of missing huge chances in a dominant first-half display.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created so many chances, played so good football, especially in the first half. How I want my team to play in and out of possession," added Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United's return of eight goals from their first nine games is their worst in the Premier League era.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag's men have won just three of those matches and drawn all three of their opening games in the Europa League to leave their manager clinging on to his job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But he claimed to have seen positive signs in a 2-1 win over Brentford last weekend and a 1-1 draw at Fenerbahce prior to their visit to the London Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At this moment the luck is definitely not on our side. Last season was not different and near the end we turned it around," said Ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are so determined it will be the same this season," he added. "We have to turn this around and it will turn around if we keep playing like we are now." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mohamed Salah's equaliser salvaged Liverpool a 2-2 draw at Premier League title rivals Arsenal on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool began the weekend on top after winning 11 of their opening 12 games in all competitions under Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But a draw sees the Reds fall one point behind Manchester City at the top of the table, with Arsenal now five points adrift of the leaders in third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're in the business where you can be on top one week and then not," said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. "We are in October and let's see what it brings us at the end of the season. Enjoy the ride."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bukayo Saka recovered from a hamstring injury to start for Arsenal and gave the home side the perfect start with a stunning touch and finish from Ben White's pass on nine minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Van Dijk quickly levelled from a corner, but Arsenal led again before half-time through Mikel Merino's header.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool improved after the break and got their reward when Darwin Nunez teed up Salah for his eighth goal of the season."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Credit to Liverpool – we feel like we didn't play the full 90 minutes," said Saka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "First half we showed our qualities, gave them nothing and they scored from a set piece," he added. "I can't think of another chance they had. Second half we weren't at our best." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Francesco Bagnaia won the Thai MotoGP in wet conditions on Sunday to close the gap on championship leader Jorge Martin, who was second, with two race weekends left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spaniard Martin's lead over defending champion Bagnaia, of Italy, was cut from 22 points to 17, ahead of another chapter in their title tussle at Sepang in Malaysia next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pedro Acosta was third at a rainy Buriram, but this was all about Martin and Bagnaia, with the championship now a two-horse race and likely to go right down to the wire.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After Malaysia, the season finale is at Valencia on November 15-17.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pramac Ducati's Martin, who is trying to win the world crown for the first time, said he was happy to settle for second, coming home nearly three seconds behind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The level we are demonstrating -- not a lot of people can understand how fast we are going even in these conditions," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia thanked his Ducati team for keeping his hopes of a third world title in a row alive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We did an incredible job. So, so happy," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Martin began the race on the front row in third and made a lightning start to grab the lead from his pole-sitting rival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the 26-year-old did not stay there long, running wide to fall to third as Bagnaia took the lead with six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez in hot pursuit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the halfway point of the 26-lap race it had developed to a duel between Bagnaia and Marquez, with Martin struggling to keep up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Marquez pushed too hard in trying to take the lead and slid off on his Ducati.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That left the title rivals to battle it out for victory, but Bagnaia held his nerve and handled the demanding conditions to see out a crucial ninth win of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bagnaia also started Saturday's sprint race on pole but ended up third, just behind Martin. Bagnaia's Ducati team-mate Enea Bastianini won the sprint.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Japan's Ai Ogura was crowned Moto2 world champion as he came second in a red-flagged race won by Spain's Aron Canet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23-year-old Ogura will move up to MotoGP next season. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Serbian Olga Danilovic powered past American qualifier Caroline Dolehide 6-3 6-1 in the Guangzhou Open final on Sunday to seal her first trophy of the season and second of her career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number 86 Danilovic, whose previous triumph came on clay in Moscow six years ago, grabbed a break in the fifth game of the first set in her maiden hardcourt final and overcame a late fightback from Dolehide to pull away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so happy with the way I played during the tournament," said Danilovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm so proud of myself and my team. I really showed what I can do. I'm very excited to be finishing the season this way."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After wrapping up the opener with a second break, the 23-year-old appeared distracted by movement in the stands and surrendered her serve early in the second set, but responded strongly to build a 4-1 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danilovic peppered her fatigued opponent with powerful shots for a double break and closed out the match on serve, finishing with a blistering forehand winner before a huge serve on her third match point. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Erling Haaland had gone three league games without a goal, he ended that mini drought at the Etihad Stadium.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland fired Manchester City to the top of the Premier League as the striker sealed a 1-0 win against Southampton, while third-placed Aston Villa were frustrated by Bournemouth's last-gasp leveller on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had gone three league games without a goal but he ended that mini drought in the first half at the Etihad Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was enough to lift Pep Guardiola's side into first place, two points ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who can regain pole position if they win Sunday's blockbuster clash with title rivals Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City have not lost a league game at the Etihad for two years, a run encompassing 35 games, and bottom-of-the-table Southampton, who have only one point from nine games this season, were never likely to shatter that impressive streak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku ruled out, Guardiola made four changes to the team that thrashed Sparta Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had scored an audacious goal against Sparta and while his effort to kill off Southampton was more prosaic, it was arguably far more valuable given the context of a tense title race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Matheus Nunes' cross reached Haaland in the fifth minute and the Norwegian showed strength and desire to get to the ball ahead of his marker for a close-range strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City spurned several chances to increase their lead but Haaland's 14th goal in all competitions this season gave the unbeaten champions seven wins from nine league matches as they chase a fifth successive title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The way Southampton played, they are so demanding. Big credit to them, it was not because we were sloppy or flat. I don't have that feeling," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We created chances and unfortunately couldn't score the second. I think we were there and sometimes they are good. We have to accept that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Aston Villa's hopes of pushing for the title suffered a setback as Bournemouth snatched a 1-1 draw at Villa Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa are unbeaten in the Champions League, sitting top of the table after seeing off Young Boys, Bayern Munich and Bologna.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But they couldn't follow their latest European success with a domestic victory despite taking the lead in the 76th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ian Maatsen crossed and Leon Bailey teed up Ross Barkley to hook in his first goal for the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Evanilson rescued Bournemouth with a headed equaliser six minutes into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brentford beat fourth-bottom Ipswich 4-3 in a thrilling clash in west London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ipswich's Sam Szmodics produced a fine finish from 15 yards in the 28th minute before George Hirst clipped a composed strike past Mark Flekken three minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yoane Wissa netted in the 44th minute and Harry Clarke's own goal seconds later hauled Brentford level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bryan Mbeumo's 51st-minute penalty, awarded for Clarke's foul on Keane Lewis-Potter, put Brentford 3-2 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Capping a miserable day for Clarke, he was sent off in the closing stages after fouling Lewis-Potter to earn a second booking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liam Delap's 86th-minute equaliser appeared to have spared Clarke's blushes, but Mbeumo snatched victory with the last kick of stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Second-bottom Wolves staged a superb fightback to draw 2-2 at fifth-placed Brighton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Danny Welbeck bagged his sixth goal of the season in first half stoppage-time and Evan Ferguson struck with a clinical finish from Tariq Lamptey's 85th-minute cross to leave Brighton in control.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Rayan Ait-Nouri got one back three minutes later and Matheus Cunha saved winless Wolves from a sixth successive league defeat with a deflected equaliser deep into stoppage-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Everton forward Beto salvaged a 1-1 draw against Fulham as his stoppage-time header cancelled out Alex Iwobi's 61st-minute strike against his former club at Goodison Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although Everton are unbeaten in their last six games, they sit just three places above the relegation zone. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   New Zealand made history with their first Test series triumph in India as spinner Mitchell Santner's heroic performance delivered a 113-run win in the second match on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand bowled out India for 245 in their chase of 359 on day three in Pune to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marks India's first Test series defeat at home since December 2012, when Alastair Cook's England beat them 2-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner, who's 7-53 in India's first innings of 156 set up the famous win, rattled the Indian chase with six wickets on a turning pitch and trumped the hosts at their own spin game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The left-hander bowled unchanged from one end, returning figures of 6-104 in 29 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ajaz Patel took the final two wickets and ended Ravindra Jadeja's resistance on 42 when the batsmen holed out in the deep and New Zealand celebrated to pin drop silence from the stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Saturday, a visiting New Zealand team had never won a Test series in India dating back to their first trip in 1955.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India bowled out New Zealand for 255 inside the first hour of play and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal in his 65-ball 77 came out attacking to raise hopes of a miracle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India lost skipper Rohit Sharma for eight but raced to 81-1 at lunch in 12 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Santner took down Shubman Gill for 23 soon after the break to end a 62-run second-wicket stand with the left-handed Jaiswal, who powered on after reaching his fifty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The in-form spinner finally had Jaiswal caught at slip, run out Rishabh Pant for a duck and trapped Virat Kohli lbw, dousing India's chances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Glenn Phillips chipped in with the wicket of Washington Sundar for 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   India spinners Sundar and Jadeja shared seven wickets between them in the second New Zealand innings, with Jadeja claiming three of the five to fall on Saturday morning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sundar, a lanky off-spinner, returned to the Indian Test team after more than three years and took 7-59.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand made 259 in their first innings riding on knocks from Devon Conway (76) and Rachin Ravindra (65) before Santner took charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have now won four Tests in India after their opening triumph was the first on Indian soil since 1988.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series victory comes after New Zealand's recent 2-0 loss in Sri Lanka on a sub-continent tour, which began with a washed-out Test against Afghanistan near New Delhi.
   <br/>

   Tim Southee stepped down after the Sri Lanka defeat and Tom Latham took over as Test captain. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The All Blacks crushed Eddie Jones's Japan 64-19 in a one-off Test in Yokohama on Saturday as the visitors scored 10 tries in a routine victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The match was the first in an All Blacks tour that will see them take on England, Ireland, France and Italy on successive weekends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan drew first blood with Fiji-born winger Jone Naikabula steaming in to touch down by the posts in the fifth minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand hit back when Mark Tele'a rampaged down the left wing and scored in the corner. Captain Patrick Tuipulotu then held off three tackles to bundle over the line before Damian McKenzie converted to make it 14-7.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan bounced back immediately, attacking off a line-out, punching holes in the defence before loose forward Faulua Makisi crashed through a wide gap off a close-range ruck.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan lock Warner Dearns thought he had put the hosts back in front, taking a lucky bounce to break clear and gallop over the line, only for the try to be disallowed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then the floodgates opened for New Zealand with Billy Proctor, Sam Cane, Samipeni Finau and Pasilio Tosi all going over the line, the latter after a barnstorming run by hooker Asafo Aumua to make it 36-12.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just before the break the All Blacks packs smashed their way over the line with Tamaiti Williams grounding the ball off the back of a maul and McKenzie converting to make it 43-12 at halftime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cam Roigard opened the scoring in the second half and took the visitors over the 50-point mark in the 44th minute after being let fly by hooker Aumua.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan managed to give the scoreboard operators a respite, repeatedly pinning the now sloppy All Blacks in their 22, but not breaching the wall of the New Zealand defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks attacks were frequently blunted and Japan again and again looked the more likely to score, but handling errors and New Zealand turnovers frustrated their efforts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 67th minute, Yoshitaka Yazaki made a blistering run down the right but to the agony of the full-capacity Nissan stadium was brought down just short by McKenzie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seconds later however Japan's reserve prop Uwe Helu, on his debut, scored the hosts' third try and a successful conversion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All Blacks replacement back Ruben Love, on debut, claimed two late tries in three minutes off the bench as the Japanese defence faded. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pakistan sealed a memorable Test series win as they thrashed England by nine wickets on Saturday after Noman Ali and Sajid Khan delivered a spin masterclass.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid knocked over all 10 England wickets to dismiss the visitors for 112 before Pakistan raced to victory in Rawalpindi before lunch on day three of the third Test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shan Masood hammered five boundaries in six balls, launching Shoaib Bashir over the ropes to complete a resounding victory, his first series triumph as captain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman finished with figures of 6-42 and Sajid 4-69 after England resumed the day on 24-3 but were dismissed in 37.2 overs for their lowest total in Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England won the first Test by an innings and 47 runs while Pakistan took the second by 152 runs, both in Multan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub for eight but Masood's six-ball 23 not out ended the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Pakistan captain had lost his previous two series in charge – 3-0 to Australia and 2-0 to Bangladesh – since being appointed last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman and Sajid were brought into the line-up after England destroyed the hosts in the first Test in Multan by an innings and 47 runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duo have knocked over 39 wickets between them in the subsequent two Tests, turning what looked like an easy England series victory Pakistan's way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Joe Root top-scored with 33 while none of the other England batters could last long enough to stop Pakistan's charge towards a first home series win since beating South Africa in February 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's previous lowest total was 130 in Lahore in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England's fate was sealed once Noman dismissed overnight batsman Harry Brook caught behind by Mohammad Rizwan for 26 and skipper Ben Stokes leg-before for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stokes once again fell in bizarre fashion as he offered no stroke to a Noman delivery, expecting it to go down the leg side but it struck him in front of the stumps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The England skipper, who missed the first Test with a hamstring injury, managed just 53 runs in four innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid made it 6-75, dismissing Jamie Smith who tried to hit him out of the ground only to miss the ball and lose his stumps for three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noman completed his sixth five-wicket haul when Root edged a sharp turning delivery to Rizwan, quashing all hopes of an England fightback.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sajid dismissed Rehan Ahmed for seven while Noman wrapped up the innings with the wicket of Jack Leach, bowled for ten. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Freddie Freeman described his walk-off grand slam as a dream come true on Friday after helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snatch a jaw-dropping World Series game one victory over the New York Yankees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman's 10th-inning blast - the first ever walk-off grand slam in a World Series game - was the latest improbable twist to what has been a roller-coaster season for the 35-year-old first baseman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Freeman, an avid student of the game, was delighted to learn he had etched his name into baseball history with his winning homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's pretty cool," Freeman said. "Obviously it's kind of amazing. When you get told you do something like that in this game that's been around a very long time -- I love the history of this game, to be a part of it, it's special.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I've been playing this game a long time, and to come up in those moments, you dream about those moments even when you're 35 and been in the league for 15 years, you want to be a part of those."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fact that Freeman has made it to the postseason is a minor miracle in itself after a challenging year beset by injuries, all overshadowed by a serious illness for his three-year-old son, Max.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An emotional Freeman returned to play later that month but then saw his postseason hopes clouded by a serious ankle sprain in late September that left him barely able to run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After celebrating his walk-off with team-mates, Freeman sprinted over to the seats behind home plate to share a moment with his father.

   "He's been throwing me batting practice since I can remember," Freeman said. "My swing is because of him. My approach is because of him. I am who I am because of him. It was kind of spur of the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers manager Dave Roberts meanwhile believed that Freeman's moment of glory was just reward for one of the most popular players in baseball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The game honors you, and when you do things the right way, you play the right way, you're a good team-mate, I just believe that the game honors you," Roberts said. "Tonight Freddie was honored. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Siobhan Haughey on Friday won gold for the 200-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup 2024 in Incheon, South Korea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SAR's swimming queen dominated the race – one of her favourite events – finishing with a time of 1:51.02, three seconds clear of silver medallist, Brittany Castelluzzo of Australia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another Australian, Milla Jansen rounded up the podium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win comes hot on the heels of Haughey’s silver-medal performance in the women's 400-metres freestyle race on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old will feature in the 50-metre breaststroke and the 100-metre freestyle on Saturday, the last of her events for the Incheon leg of the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, 15-year-old SAR swimmer Li Su-yiu finished seventh in the race with a personal best of 1:59.17 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The event is part of a qualifying series for the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest at the end of this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Held over three consecutive weeks, the series began last week in Shanghai and concludes in Singapore early next month.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four time NBA champion Klay Thompson scored 22 points in his Dallas debut on Thursday, giving a lift to Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic in a 120-109 NBA victory over the San Antonio Spurs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slovenian star Doncic scored 28 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for the Mavs, who fell to the Boston Celtics in last season's NBA Finals and acquired Thompson in a free agent deal in the off-season with the hope of going even further this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thompson, who won four titles in 13 seasons with the Golden State Warriors, was delighted with his first outing for the Mavs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Blue is my favorite colour," he told broadcaster TNT. "And Mavs blue looks good on me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kyrie Irving scored 15 points for Dallas, and the Mavericks harried the Spurs defensively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama, aiming to build on last season's Rookie of the Year campaign, connected on just five of 18 shots from the field on the way to 17 points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spurs coughed up 19 turnovers leading to 17 Mavericks points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chris Paul, an 11-time All-Star point guard brought in to lend veteran experience to the young San Antonio squad trying to get the Spurs back in the playoffs after a five-season absence, scored all of his points on a lone three-pointer, finishing one-of-six from the field with eight assists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Couldn't ask for a better start," Thompson said. "Just sharing the flow with Kyrie, Luka and the rest of the guys – very special after a hard month of really good work."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But it's just a small step for where we want to go," he added.  (AFP)

    Félix double fires Chelsea in Conference League rout

  <img alt="Félix in action against Greek side Panathinaikos. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776112_1_20241025082527.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   João Félix ended his goal drought with a brace as Chelsea powered to a 4-1 win against Panathinaikos in the Uefa Conference League, while Welsh club The New Saints made history with a 2-0 victory against Kazakh side Astana on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Portugal forward Félix has struggled to make an impact since returning for a second spell with Chelsea in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yet to start a Premier League game following his move from Atlético Madrid, the 24-year-old seized the chance to prove a point to Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Félix's only goal in seven previous appearances this season came on his debut at Wolves on August 25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He ended his six-game barren run in the first half against out-classed Panathinaikos and netted again after the interval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mykhailo Mudryk and Christopher Nkunku were also on target as Chelsea made it two wins from two games in the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The most important thing is no matter how many players we change, you can see the identity of the team. The identity is quite clear," Maresca said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we want is exactly what they're doing, taking the chance when we give it to them," he added. "Tonight once again they showed that."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Maresca made 11 changes from the side that lost at Liverpool last weekend, but still fielded a strong side that was far too dynamic for the Greeks. (AFP)

    Mourinho sees red as Fenerbahce hold Man Utd

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Fenerbahce boss José Mourinho said his former club Manchester United escaped Istanbul with a point after he was sent to the stands in a 1-1 Uefa Europa League draw on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United have drawn all three of their European games this season and a point does little to ease the pressure on under-fire manager Erik ten Hag.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Christian Eriksen fired a depleted United in front on 15 minutes, but Fenerbahce had the better of the chances and got their reward when Youssef En-Nesyri equalised early in the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We were better than them, so overall a good result for Manchester United," Mourinho said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A point leaves United languishing in 21st of the 36-team table and with their chances of securing a top-eight finish to progress directly to the last 16 fading.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fenerbahce are in 14th on five points, with a top-24 finish enough to qualify for the playoff stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mourinho also came into the game under pressure early in his reign with Fenerbahce trailing rivals Galatasaray by eight points at the top of the Turkish Super Lig.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we play like this in the Turkish league, we destroy every team," added Mourinho, who was shown a red card for his protests after appeals for a penalty were waived away in the second half. "He (the referee) told me something incredible. He could see the action in the box, and my behaviour on the touchline.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I congratulate him because it is incredible his peripheral vision. During the game, 100 miles per hour, he had one eye on the penalty situation and one eye on the bench and my behaviour," Mourinho said. "That is why he is one of the best referees in the world."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United were without 10 players, including captain Bruno Fernandes, due to suspension or injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Fernandes' absence, defender Noussair Mazraoui started in an unfamiliar attacking midfield role and had a part to play in an impressive opening goal. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Raphinha hat-trick handed Barcelona a 4-1 win against Bayern Munich in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a clash that pitted five-time winners Barca against six-time champions Bayern, it was the home side that stole the show thanks to a triple from Brazilian attacker Raphinha and a goal from in-form veteran Robert Lewandowski.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Harry Kane levelled after Barca's first-minute opener for his fifth goal of the campaign but was helpless as his team collapsed to their second defeat in three Champions League outings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In my opinion this game could have been a Champions League final," Raphinha said. "To be able to win it in this way, so well, in front of our fans, is quite special – and I leave here happy."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The result leaves Bayern in the bottom half of the table, while Barcelona have two wins and are 10th.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha sent the hosts on their way at the Olympic Stadium inside 60 seconds, tucking home after rounding goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kane levelled in the 18th minute with an acrobatic volley from a Serge Gnabry cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ex-Bayern player Lewandowski then restored Barca's lead in the 36th minute by pouncing on a loose ball after Fermin Lopez had snuck behind the visiting defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raphinha got his second on the stroke of half-time with a curling effort off his right side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brazil international's third on 56 minutes showcased Barca's danger on the counter as he galloped onto a swept pass from Lamine Yamal before arrowing home a left-footed finish with both centre-halves trailing in his wake. (AFP)

    Haaland leads Man City to 5-0 rout of Sparta Prague

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erling Haaland's spectacular acrobatic effort lit up Manchester City's 5-0 win over Sparta Prague on Wednesday to move into third place in the Uefa Champions League table.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Norwegian scored twice, including a backheel at shoulder height, as City ran riot against the Czech champions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Phil Foden, John Stones and Matheus Nunes were also on target for Pep Guardiola's men, who remain unbeaten in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's a freak isn't he," said Foden of Haaland's athleticism. "If I tried to do that I'd pull my groin. I don't know how he did it, I just think it's just his long legs."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sparta had taken four points from their opening two Champions League games against Salzburg and Stuttgart, but City were a step up in class too far for the visitors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It became painful in the second half after it went to 2-0. It became very difficult and we had difficulty coping with it," said Sparta coach Lars Friis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foden's struggle for form and fitness has compounded City's injury problems with Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haaland had nine efforts on goal in total but was frustrated in the first half as Sparta refused to let the floodgates open before the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Haaland did finally deliver City's second with an effort reminiscent of his strike against old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that won Champions League goal of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was an amazing goal – I was speechless after he shot," said Nunes. "When he scored against Dortmund, I was watching on TV and to see this live was amazing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are now unbeaten from open play in 26 Champions League matches, setting the longest unbeaten streak by any club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victory takes Guardiola's men onto seven points from their opening three Champions League games, behind only Premier League rivals Liverpool and Aston Villa. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 27th minute tap in from Darwin Núñez took Liverpool to a controlled 1-0 win at RB Leipzig in the Uefa Champions League on Wednesday, continuing their excellent start under new coach Arne Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool broke through some early Leipzig pressure just before the half-hour mark when Mo Salah hit a perfect header across his body.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Núñez jumped high to prod home the goal-bound ball, grabbing his first Champions League goal since February 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite a late Leipzig flurry, Liverpool again showed the control and resilience that has taken them to the top of the Premier League table just days out from Sunday's clash at Arsenal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're really happy for the win – we played a difficult away game. We controlled the game in large parts, apart from the last few minutes," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I asked for a goal. Darwin gave us one, but in the lead-up to the goal, Cody Gakpo was important and Mo Salah with an assist," he added. "It was a team goal – it's pleasing to see that Darwin did a really good job today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot has won 11 of his first 12 games in charge in all competitions, the best start of any manager in Liverpool history, while Leipzig are now zero from three in Europe this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both sides had impressed domestically this season on the back of strong defensive records, with Liverpool conceding three in eight Premier League games and Leipzig just two in seven. (AFP)

    Ohtani 50-50 baseball sells for record-breaking price

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The ball hit by Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani for his 50th home run of the season sold for a record-breaking US$4.39 million, auction house Goldin said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The home run saw Ohtani become the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit 50 home-runs and steal 50 bases in a single season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Shohei Ohtani made history with this baseball, and now, with the highest sale price for any ball ever sold," Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of the auction house, said in a statement. "This legendary piece of sports memorabilia has made history again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We received bids from around the world, a testament to the significance of this iconic collectible and Ohtani's impact on sports," he added. "I'm thrilled for the winning bidder."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The record price for a baseball was previously the US$3.05 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball of 1998.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani's 50th home run of the season came during a spectacular offensive outing for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Marlins in Miami on September 19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had six hits in six at-bats, including two doubles, for a total of five extra-base hits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He drove in 10 runs, scored four himself and stole two bases to help the Dodgers clinch a postseason berth that will mark Ohtani's first trip to the MLB playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani had already stolen two bases in the first two innings to take his tally to 51 for the season when he turned up the power at the plate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He smashed his 49th home run of the season in the sixth inning then established the 50-50 club with a second homer in the seventh – belting a curveball from Mike Baumann into the left field stands at loanDepot Park.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fan who caught it reportedly turned down the Dodgers' offer to purchase it for US$300,000 and wasted little time in consigning it with Goldin. (AFP)

    LeBron and son Bronny share court in NBA first

  <img alt="LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775904_1_20241023211949.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   LeBron and Bronny became the first father and son to play in the NBA together on Tuesday night during the Los Angeles Lakers' season opener, fulfilling a dream set out a few years ago by LeBron, the top scorer in league history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “That moment, us being at the scorer’s table together and checking in together, it’s a moment I’m never going to forget,” LeBron said. “No matter how old I get, no matter how my memory may fade as I get older or whatever, I will never forget that moment.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Father and son checked into the game against Minnesota simultaneously with four minutes left in the second quarter, prompting a big ovation from a home crowd aware of the enormity of the milestone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old LeBron had already started the game and played 13 minutes before he teamed up with his 20-year-old son for about 2 and a half minutes of action.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James is a four-time champion and 20-time All-Star, while LeBron James Jr was a second-round pick by the Lakers last summer. They are the first father and son to play in the world's top basketball league at the same time, let alone on the same team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Y’all ready? You see the intensity, right? Just play carefree, though,” father told son on the bench before they checked in, an exchange captured by the TNT cameras and microphones. “Don’t worry about mistakes. Just go out and play hard.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron contributed 16 points in the Lakers' 110-103 win. Meanwhile, Bronny had an early offensive rebound and missed a tip-in, and his first NBA jump shot moments later was a 3-pointer that came up just short.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He – who, like many first-year players, is not expected to see significant floor time this season – checked out one possession later with 1:19 left in the second quarter, getting another ovation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “(I) tried not to focus on everything that’s going on around me, and tried to focus on going in as a rookie and not trying to mess up,” Bronny said. “But yeah, I totally did feel the energy, and I appreciate Laker Nation for showing the support for me and my dad.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron first spoke about his dream to play alongside Bronny a few years ago, while his oldest son was still in high school. The dream became real after Bronny entered the draft as a teenager following one collegiate season, and the Lakers grabbed him with the 55th overall pick. (AP/Reuters)

    Emma Raducanu becomes latest to pull out of HK Open

  <img alt="Emma Raducanu has already missed four tournaments on the WTA's Asian Tour.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Wednesday announced that former US Open champion Emma Raducanu will not take part in the tournament, a development that comes on the heels of star player Naomi Osaka's decision to drop out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two of the big names out, organisers stressed there will still be an "incredible line-up of marquee stars" at the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It pointed out that top players – including defending champion Leylah Fernandez, former world number one Simona Halep, and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Lulu Sun – will be taking part in the event which runs from October 26 to November 3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong China Tennis Association said in a statement that it was unfortunate that Raducanu will not be participating in the all-female tournament and wished her a speedy recovery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Injuries are an unfortunate part of the game, and we do hope that she will be back competing as soon as possible," the statement added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's decision comes after four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka announced her withdrawal from the tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old Briton continues to rehab from a foot injury she sustained in the quarter-finals of the Korea Open in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I’m sorry to say that I will not be able to play in Hong Kong next week," Raducanu said in a statement through the association. "While my foot is making good progress, I need a little more time before I am match fit," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Raducanu's spot in the draw has since been filled by 2020 Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Jayson Tatum scored 37 points as the Boston Celtics launched the defence of their NBA crown with an emphatic 132-109 defeat of the New York Knicks on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After a triumphant pre-game ceremony that saw Boston celebrate raising their record-breaking 18th championship banner, the Celtics delivered a performance that suggested they could well be the team to beat once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A devastating 43-point first quarter put Boston in complete control during the first half, with Tatum producing an electric shooting performance to pour in 18 points from three-point range over the two quarters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum had brought the house down in a pre-game address to a packed TD Garden, signalling the Celtics' determination to win back-to-back championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is special. On behalf of me, my teammates, the organisation, we couldn't have done it without you last year," Tatum told the crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let's enjoy this moment together," he added. "I can honestly say, to the best fans in the world – let's do it again."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boston powered to last season's NBA championship after winning 64 games in the regular season before dropping just three games in the playoffs, sealing victory with a 4-1 rout of the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That win came after years of frustrating postseason disappointments, which included a 4-2 defeat to Golden State in the 2022 NBA Finals and an agonising 4-3 loss to Miami in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Celtics have retained the core of the team from last season's roster and look well-positioned to mount a serious defence of their title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against New York on Tuesday, Joe Mazzulla's team picked up where they had left off in June, with all of their heavy-hitters coming up big to leave the Knicks chasing the game for long periods.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four of the their five starters – Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Jrue Holiday – posted double-digit points tallies before half-time, helping the team take a commanding 74-55 lead into the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Although the Knicks had enjoyed parity in a 31-31 second quarter, the Celtics were in no mood to let their advantage slip after the break, coasting home to close out the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tatum finished with 10 assists and four rebounds in addition to his 37 points, with White adding 24 points and Brown 23. Holiday added 18 while Al Horford chipped in with 11.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jalen Brunson led the Knicks scoring with 22 points, alongside Miles McBride with 22 from the bench. (AFP)

    Aston Villa beat Bologna, go top of Champions League

  <img alt="Aston Villa's John McGinn with teammate Jhon Duran. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775757_1_20241023081956.jpg&q=90" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   John McGinn said there is no limit to Aston Villa's ambition in the Uefa Champions League after beating Bologna 2-0 to go top of the table in a dream return to the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Villa last played in the top tier of European football back in 1983 but Unai Emery's transformation of a sleeping giant knows no bounds as they became the only side to register three wins from three Champions League games so far.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGinn's free-kick flew beyond everyone into the far corner to open the scoring in the second half before Jhon Duran kept up his prolific strike rate on a rare start for the Colombian.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't want to stop here – it puts us in a great position," said McGinn, who joined the club when they were still in the second tier of English football in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What we are building here is amazing," he added. "This is home for me – it is my seventh season here, we've had ups and downs. It has been a rollercoaster. Hopefully we can keep climbing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bologna, by contrast, have just one point from their opening three games and one win in 11 games in all competitions this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Rossoblu were one of the stories of European football last season as they finished fifth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 60 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they have struggled since losing star players Riccardo Calafiori and Joshua Zirkzee to Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United, while coach Thiago Motta left to take charge of Juventus.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Emery said on the eve of the game he wants to "break barriers" at a club that has not won a trophy since 1996.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And the Spaniard showed the impressive strength in depth at his disposal with a comfortable win despite making four changes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are playing focussed, responsible and the team is progressing and maturing in everything," said Emery.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duran was finally handed his first start in either the Premier League or Champions League after scoring five times as a substitute this season. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Glasgow has been confirmed as the host city for the troubled 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be a slimmed-down version of the multi-sport event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The future of the 2026 Games was thrown into doubt when the Australian state of Victoria, the original hosts, withdrew last year, citing rising costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Scottish government effectively gave the green light to Glasgow last month and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) announced on Tuesday that the 2014 hosts will stage the next Games, from July 23 to August 2, 2026.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Games will feature just 10 sports compared with the 19 on show at the 2022 edition in the English city of Birmingham.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Para sport will once again be fully integrated as "a key priority and point of difference for the Games", with six para sports included on the programme.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The schedule will feature athletics and para athletics, swimming and para swimming, artistic gymnastics, track cycling and para track cycling, netball, weightlifting and para powerlifting, boxing, judo, bowls and para bowls, as well as 3x3 basketball and 3x3 wheelchair basketball.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the sports missing out compared to the 2022 Games are triathlon, diving, hockey, T20 cricket, squash, badminton and rugby sevens.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Around 3,000 athletes are expected to compete from up to 74 Commonwealth nations and territories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CGF said Glasgow 2026 would deliver more than US$130 million of inward investment into the city, with no need for public funding.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia will provide part of the finance after Victoria pulled out, citing a projected cost of more than US$4 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On behalf of the entire Commonwealth sport movement, we are delighted to officially confirm that the 2026 Commonwealth Games will take place in the host city of Glasgow," said CGF chief executive Katie Sadleir.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commonwealth Games, held every four years, evolved out of the British Empire Games and is still made up mainly of countries and territories once subject to British imperial rule. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arsenal bounced back from their embarrassment at Bournemouth as an own goal from Shakhtar Donetsk keeper Dmytro Riznyk gave the Gunners a 1-0 win in the Uefa Champions League on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mikel Arteta's side crashed to a damaging 2-0 defeat against the Cherries in the Premier League last weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That was Arsenal's first loss in all competitions since the Champions League quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich in April.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their response against Shakhtar was unconvincing, but they did enough to claim three points thanks to Riznyk's first half own goal from Gabriel Martinelli's strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leandro Trossard missed a late Arsenal penalty that would have put a flattering gloss on the scoreline at the Emirates Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Worryingly for Arteta, Riccardo Calafiori was forced off in the second half after appearing to injury his knee in the latest injury blow for a team currently missing Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Jurrien Timber.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta is already without suspended French defender William Saliba for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice admitted his side let their "standards slip" after Saliba's red card against Bournemouth set them on the way to their first Premier League defeat this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arteta had urged his players to use the "pain" of that setback as motivation against Shakhtar, but the response was tepid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Gunners have seven points from their opening three Champions League games, yet this was a far cry from the impressive 2-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain in their previous tie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With one point from three games, Shakhtar remain without a goal in the Champions League this term.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Ukrainian champions spent 17 hours travelling to north London by bus, train and plane, setting off from Kiev on Friday and stopping in Lviv before reaching Poland for a flight to England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Unable to play home European fixtures in Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, Marino Pushych's side competed gamely but lacked a cutting edge. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tiger Woods is expected to make his TGL debut on January 14, the new tech-infused indoor team golf league announced on Monday, along with the full schedule for its inaugural season that will be held entirely in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 15-time major champion's first potential match will come in the second week of the season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is set to be held inside a venue that fits 1,500 fans, wrapped around a field of play featuring a five-storey-high simulator screen and an adjustable putting surface.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 48-year-old Woods, who had back surgery in September and played a limited schedule in recent years due to injuries, is a part owner of Jupiter Links Golf Club, a team that features himself, Max Homa, Tom Kim and Kevin Kisner. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Brazil superstar Neymar returned to action on Monday following more than a year out, with the Al Hilal forward appearing as a second-half substitute in his side's gripping 5-4 win against Asian champions Al Ain in the UAE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain attacker, 32, had not played since rupturing his meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while on international duty in October last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar, who underwent surgery and a sustained period of rehabilitation, is his country's all-time leading goalscorer, with 79 goals in 128 appearances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Named on the Hilal bench for the first time since his injury, he was introduced on 76 minutes of the Asian Champions Elite encounter at a heaving Hazzan Bin Zayed Stadium in Al Ain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   By then, the record four-time Asian champions, who lead the current Saudi Pro League, were 5-3 up, thanks to goals from Renan Lodi and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, and a Salem Al Dawsari hat-trick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Neymar cannot be registered for the Saudi top-flight until January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I need to prepare Neymar with games; that's the only possible means to bring him to his level, which was the idea today," Hilal coach Jorge Jesus said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are some risks for the team because we need to use the games to prepare him, but it's the only way to have one of our important players back at the highest level," the Portuguese boss added. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka said on Monday she hopes to stay at the top of the world rankings a little longer than last time after returning to the number one WTA spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old jumped above Poland's French Open champion Iga Swiatek thanks to year-end adjustments in the standings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This season's US and Australian Open champion Sabalenka spent just eight weeks at the top of the rankings in September 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "N1...," she said on X, formerly Twitter. "Let's see for how long this time," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has lost just one match since mid-August in a run which included her success at Flushing Meadows and her next tournament could be the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia on November 2 to 9.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swiatek, who won her third straight Roland Garros title in June, had held the top ranking since late last year. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong Tennis Open organisers on Monday said that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka is pulling out of this month's tournament due to injury, though the Japanese star will still meet fans in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former world number one injured her back during the China Open earlier this month, and has since skipped multiple tournaments, including the Japan Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I love visiting the [SAR] tournament and despite the obvious disappointment of not being able to play, I want to reassure all my wonderful Hong Kong fans that I will still be attending the event," Osaka said in a statement through the Hong Kong China Tennis Association.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am very much looking forward to meeting you all."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The association expressed disappointment, but stressed that the event will still be highly competitive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Participating players include defending champion Leylah Fernandez, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world number one Simona Halep, as well as former US Open Champion Emma Raducanu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Qualifiers for the local tournament, a WTA250 series, are due to take place at Victoria Park on Saturday. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tommy Edman and Will Smith homered to send Shohei Ohtani into the World Series for the first time, and the Los Angeles Dodgers eliminated the New York Mets with a 10-5 victory in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers took the best-of-seven National League Championship Series 4-2 over the Mets and will open the World Series at home on Friday against the New York Yankees, who own a record 27 titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This will be the Dodgers' 22nd World Series –13th in Los Angeles – and first since 2020, when they beat Tampa Bay during the pandemic-delayed season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are back in the World Series for the 41st time and first in 15 years. Game 1 is Friday at Dodger Stadium, pitting New York slugger Aaron Judge and Ohtani – MLB's top home-run hitters this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s kind of what the people wanted, what we all wanted,” Dodgers star Mookie Betts said. “It’s going to be a battle of two good teams – a lot of long flights across the country.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It’ll be the 12th time the storied franchises meet in the World Series and the first in 43 years. The Yankees have beaten the Dodgers eight times, while the Dodgers’ three championships against the Bronx Bombers came in 1955, 1963 and 1981.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s the place that I’ve dreamt of playing all my life,” Ohtani said through a translator, “and to be able to finally come to this stage and be able to play and hopefully win it is my next goal.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, playing his first season with the Dodgers after agreeing to a record-breaking contract in free agency, had two hits and scored two runs in Game 6. He hit .364 with two homers and six RBIs in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Not bad for his first postseason after spending six years with the Los Angeles Angels, who never had a winning record or reached the playoffs during his tenure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers eliminated the Mets on their second try in the series. They outscored New York 40-26 in the six games. None of the games were close, with the Dodgers earning two shutouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, meanwhile, came within two wins of reaching the World Series after a 22-33 start. (AFP/AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong's "Flying Fish" Siobhan Haughey bagged two golds and a bronze to conclude the first stop of the World Aquatics Swimming World Cup in Shanghai on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Olympic medallist won her first medal of the competition on Saturday in the women's 200 metres freestyle, with a time of 1 minute 51.46 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Haughey, who won two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics, brought more good news on the final day in Shanghai by winning a bronze in the 50 metres breaststroke, followed by a gold in the 100 metres freestyle only 15 minutes later.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She came third in the breaststroke event after finishing with a time of 29.74 seconds – behind China's Tang Qianting and Benedetta Pilato of Italy – to create a new Hong Kong record, and dominated the freestyle event by leading from start to finish, ending with a time of 51.89 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The second leg of the World Cup will be held in Incheon, South Korea from October 24-26, while the last stop will be in Singapore from October 31 to November 2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The World Cup is a qualifying event for the World Aquatics Swimming Championships (25m) in Budapest at the end of the year.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Liberty won the 2024 WNBA championship after beating the Minnesota Lynx 67-62 in overtime of a decisive Game 5 on Sunday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jonquel Jones scored 17 points to lead New York, which was one of the original franchises in the league. The Liberty made the WNBA Finals five times before, losing each one, including last season. This time they wouldn’t be denied, although it took an extra five minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The win gave the city of New York its first basketball title since 1973 when the Knicks won the NBA championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With stars Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu struggling on offense, other players stepped up. Leonie Fiebich started off overtime with a 3-pointer, and then Nyara Sabally had a steal for a layup to make it 65-60 and bring the sellout crowd to a frenzied state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota didn’t score in overtime until Kayla McBride hit two free throws with just under two minutes left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx missed all six of their field goal attempts in overtime. After Ionescu missed a shot with 21 seconds left, her 18th miss on 19 shot attempts, the Lynx had one last chance, but Bridget Carleton missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stewart, who missed a free throw with 0.8 seconds left in Game 1, hit two free throws with 10.1 seconds left to seal the victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the players hugged and streamers fell from the rafters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Napheesa Collier scored 22 points to lead Minnesota before fouling out with 13 seconds left in overtime.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Lynx were trying for a record fifth WNBA title, breaking a tie with the Seattle Storm and Houston Comets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minnesota won four titles from 2011 to 2017 behind the core group of Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Sylvia Fowles and Maya Moore. That was the team’s last appearance in the WNBA Finals until this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is the first time since 2019 that the WNBA Finals have gone the distance. Since the league switched to a best-of-five format in 2005, seven other series have gone to a Game 5 and the home team has won five of those contests, including in 2019. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An outstanding all-round performance by Amelia Kerr led New Zealand to their first ever Women's T20 World Cup title as they beat South Africa by a commanding 32 runs in Sunday's final in Dubai.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Player of the Match Kerr top-scored with 43 as New Zealand posted an imposing 158-5 in their 20 overs before taking 3-24, and crucially picking up the key wickets of Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch, to restrict South Africa to 126-9 in their 20 overs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It marked a sweet finish to skipper Sophie Devine's career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The victory came 14 years after the White Ferns lost to Australia by just three runs in the 2010 final. They also lost to England in the 2009 championship match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For South Africa it made for a double disappointment having lost last year's final to Australia in Cape Town. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Charles Leclerc led Carlos Sainz home as Ferrari claimed a resounding one-two triumph in Sunday's United States Grand Prix after Lando Norris was relegated to fourth, having finished third on track ahead of title rival Max Verstappen who took the third podium spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McLaren's Norris was penalised five seconds for gaining an advantage by leaving the track to pass the series leader and Red Bull's three-time champion on lap 53 of the 56-lap contest and dropped to fourth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Verstappen has now extended his lead over Norris to 57 points in the drivers' championship with five races left this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leclerc came home 8.562 sec seconds ahead of Sainz with Verstappen third, adrift by 19.412 seconds, leaving Norris fourth ahead of McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri and George Russell of Mercedes who finished sixth after starting from the pitlane.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sergio Perez was seventh in the second Red Bull ahead of Nico Hulkenberg of Haas, Liam Lawson of RB and Franco Colapinto of Williams.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Leclerc, it was a first victory in the United States, his third of the season and the eighth of his career while for Ferrari it was a first one-two in American since 2006.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It wasn't an easy weekend up to now, I have been struggling with the feeling with the car, but I had confidence in the race," said Leclerc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am really happy with today, a 1-2 for the team, we couldn't have dreamed for better," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a difficult race for me. I never had the pace to attack and defending was quite difficult with understeer," Verstappen, meanwhile, said after the race. "It was a tough battle and tough to keep Norris behind, but it's a great result."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris made a good initial start from his fourth pole in five races, but left a critical gap on the inside which encouraged Verstappen to attack, forcing them both wide and allowing Leclerc to snatch the lead from fourth on the grid as they came through Turn One. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City snatched a controversial 2-1 win at Wolves as John Stones' last-gasp goal was given after a VAR review to send the champions to the top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pep Guardiola's side trailed to Jorgen Strand Larsen's surprise opener for Wolves early in the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Josko Gvardiol dragged City back on level terms before the interval and, with just seconds left in stoppage time, Stones headed the visitors to a dramatic sixth win in eight league games this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bottom-of-the-table Wolves claimed Stones' goal should have been disallowed for offside and interference by Bernardo Silva on goalkeeper Jose Sa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm trying to remain calm," Wolves boss Gary O'Neil said. "I have been involved in a few of those and not had many go in our favour."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is some grey area that can go either way and once it was like that I wasn't confident it would go our way," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are a point clear of previous leaders Liverpool, who reclaimed pole position with a victory against Chelsea on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chasing a fifth successive English title, Guardiola's men have set a new club record as their unbeaten run in the league reached 31 games since their loss to Aston Villa in December.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In English top-flight history, only six times has a side gone more than 30 matches without losing, most recently Liverpool's run of 44 games from 2019 to 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are not used to winning games at the end, like Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool it many times happened. It is a good flavour for us," Guardiola said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After 10 or 12 games in the Premier League you don't have to see the table, it is just the beginning," Guardioloa added. "But of course it is nice to be winning, you are alive and in that position." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The rivalry between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the world's two highest ranked players, brings out the best in both, Sinner said on Saturday after beating Alcaraz in the final of the Six Kings Slam exhibition event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner, who won 6-7(5) 6-3 6-3 to bag the US$6 million title, said he hoped for a long rivalry with Alcaraz, after Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic faced off for the final time in the third-place match earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I wake up in the morning trying to understand the ways how to beat him. This kind of rivalries, this kind of players, they push us always to our 100 percent," world number one Sinner said in a post-match interview.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hopefully this rivalry will last as long as possible. But there are so many other great players who can jump in – let's see what's coming in the future," the 23-year-old said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy's Sinner and Spain's Alcaraz have won two Grand Slams each this year, with Alcaraz beating Sinner in closely fought clashes at the French Open semi-finals and the China Open final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The off-the-court friends have played each other 10 times on the ATP tour, with 21-year-old Alcaraz winning six matches, including the last three.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will do everything so that this rivalry gets better and better – I am happy to share the court with him," four-times Grand Slam winner Alcaraz said. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Arne Slot said Liverpool rose to the challenge posed by a step up in opposition after beating Chelsea 2-1 to move back top of the Premier League on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Reds had not faced any of the top nine in the table in their opening seven league games of the season to give Slot a gentle start to the demanding task of succeeding Jurgen Klopp.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool did not have things all their own way at Anfield, but ground out another victory thanks to Mohamed Salah's penalty and Curtis Jones' second-half winner after Nicolas Jackson brought Chelsea level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The better the teams you face the more you need to fight," said Slot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It helps if you play against a Chelsea, it is a big game and everyone feels it," he added. "We felt it and the fans felt it because they were there for us today. We showed up, that was the most important thing."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visit of a confident Chelsea side kicked off a daunting run for Slot's men in the coming months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool face Arsenal, Brighton, Aston Villa and Manchester City in four of their next five Premier League games, as well as Champions League ties against RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid before the end of November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is our biggest test, to play Champions League and Premier League, the hardest games, three days in a row," added Slot. "Many other games were hard but this might have been the hardest maybe because of the amount of quality players they have and the structure they have."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defeat for Chelsea was their first in the league since Enzo Maresca's debut as coach against Manchester City on the opening weekend of the campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there were plenty of positives for Maresca as the Blues were a different animal to the side that were thrashed 4-1 on their last visit to Anfield in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We don't like to drop points and lose a game, but if you have to choose a way, this is the way," said Maresca.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We came here and tried to control the game. For most of the game we played in their half and I thought the performance was fantastic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I came here many times in the past and I know how difficult it is but the way we controlled and managed the game was fantastic," he added. "This is the right direction." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Baseball’s biggest brand is going back to October’s main stage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Juan Soto hit a three-run homer with two outs in the 10th inning and the New York Yankees advanced to their 41st World Series – and first in 15 years – by beating the Cleveland Guardians 5-2 in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) on Saturday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto, who was acquired in a seven-player trade with San Diego in December, moved the Bronx Bombers into position with one big swing. He also caught the final out of the game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We’re right where we belong,” said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who pulled off the deal for Soto.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to win their 28th title against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers. Game 6 of the National League Championship Series is on Sunday at Dodger Stadium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the 10th, Austin Wells walked with one out and Alex Verdugo followed with a grounder to second baseman Andrés Giménez, whose soft toss to the bag was dropped by rookie shortstop Brayan Rocchio for an error.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland reliever Hunter Gaddis struck out Gleyber Torres and had Soto in a 1-2 count before New York’s stylish outfielder sent a shot over the wall in centre. Soto danced down the first-base line and paused to celebrate with his teammates before circling the bases.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I was just saying to myself, `You’re all over that guy. You’re all over that guy. He ain’t got anything,’” said Soto, who moved alongside his manager, Aaron Boone, as the only New York players to homer in an extra-inning, series-clinching win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soto is eligible for free agency this winter, and Yankees fans chanted “Re-sign Soto!” during the post-game festivities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer and was named ALCS MVP as the Yankees took care of the Guardians in five games. It wasn’t easy.
