 Hong Kong's rising tennis star Coleman Wong on Tuesday fell short of a third round victory at this year's Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old fell to Australian Adam Walton, who won 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 in a match-up that lasted for two hours and 18 minutes at the Hard Rock Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong previously pulled off a stunning win of his own in Miami, beating American 13th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory provided him with a place in the third round of a Masters 1000 for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong – currently ranked 128th in the world – was the second-lowest ranked player to reach the Miami Open third round in 10 years.

    Billiard, tennis retain Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324223333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

    Appeal crunch time for Blatter and Platini

<img alt="Michael Platini, left, with Sepp Blatter in 2014. File Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797152_1_20250324151246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and France football great Michel Platini will appear before a Swiss court on Tuesday to hear whether the case that finished their careers in football will end with their acquittals or convictions for corruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, once among the most powerful figures in global football, will appear at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court two-and-a-half years after they were acquitted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiss federal prosecutors rejected the decision at a lower court from 2022, leading to the new hearing in the town of Muttenz, near Basel. Both men deny the charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case relates to a two million Swiss franc payment Blatter authorised for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, which was made in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini and Blatter said the payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because Fifa lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The affair, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer body Uefa, torpedoed his hopes of eventually succeeding Blatter at the top of Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini were suspended from football in 2015 by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years. Although their exclusions were later reduced, the ban ended their careers as senior football administrators. The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world soccer's ruling body to pay Platini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work. This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties," the indictment said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment was credible, while there were serious doubts about the prosecution's allegation the payment was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years until 2015, has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Now a frail 89-year-old, he said he was the victim of a witch-hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, a three-times European Footballer of the Year, insisted the money was related to backpay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no corruption, there's no swindling, there's nothing at all," he said at the start of the appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Dominic Nellen said the case was designed to stop Platini becoming Fifa president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Platini was the most likely successor to Blatter in 2015, but someone wanted him out of the way," Nellen said. "At every turn there seems to be an attempt to stop Platini becoming president of Fifa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter was eventually replaced by Gianni Infantino, who had worked for Platini at Uefa. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, Platini, was banned from football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino has denied helping to bring about Platini's downfall, and said he only stepped up when Uefa asked him after the allegations against Platini emerged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors want a sentence of 20 months in jail, suspended for two years for both Blatter and Platini, and to confiscate the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides can appeal against the judgement to the Swiss Federal Court, the country's highest legal authority. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy striker Moise Kean admitted his team "got distracted" after Germany's Jamal Musiala scored an easy goal into an empty net when absent-minded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his post during the Nations League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany saw off Italy 5-4 on aggregate following a 3-3 second-leg draw to reach the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich, who scored the first goal for Germany, played a key role in the bizarre second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kimmich, seeing the Italian keeper had drifted off his line, took a quickly-taken corner that was flicked into the empty net by Musiala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got distracted. It can happen to concede goals like that. We'll work better on it next time," said Kean who scored twice in the second half as Italy rallied from a 3-0 interval deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said the quick thinking was "world-class and unbelievably smart," and admitted "I didn't see it at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  One person who did see it was 15-year-old ballboy Noel Urbaniak who noticed that Donnarumma wasn't paying attention and quickly threw the ball to Kimmich.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very sharp, which isn't bad in a game like this, he did well," said Kimmich who autographed and presented a match ball to the teenager after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He'll get a free ticket to the next home game," promised German football federation Rudi Voller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never been a ballboy before, this is my first time, and it feels really good," Urbaniak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy coach Luciano Spalletti blasted his team's lack of maturity over the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that they take corners quickly and must not turn our backs," said Spalletti. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva, coming off back-to-back WTA 1000 wins in Dubai and Indian Wells, exited in the third round, her 13-match winning streak ending with a three-sets loss to American Amanda Anisimova.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, the 11th seed, hoped to continue her rise up the rankings with a strong showing in Miami but appeared to be hampered by injury as she lost to 17th seeded Miami resident Anisimova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva received lengthy medical attention in her abdominal area when 2-1 down in the first set, which she lost 7-6 (7/5).
  <br>
  <br>
  She bounced back, dominating the second set 6-2 but Anisimova won the third set of the two hour and 49-minute battle 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anisimova will face Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, after the British player advanced when her American opponent McCartney Kessler retired injured in the second set of their encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year," said Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone," said Dimitrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils delighted his supporters defeating Spaniard Jaume Munar 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7/1). (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leader Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a balanced scoring performance in a 120-91 victory at Utah.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jarrett Allen scored 18 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16 to lead six Cavaliers in double figures while Evan Mobley added 11 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a long season. We're going to go through some ups and downs, we're not going to play our best," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this streak had happened in November I don't think everybody would be tripping as much. This is all part of the season. It's all part of getting better. Won tonight. We've turned the corner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs, with the NBA's second-best record, improved to 57-14 after prior road trip losses at the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Phoenix, while the Jazz, with the NBA's second-worst record, fell to 16-56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland stretched the lead atop the East to five and a half games over defending NBA champion Boston but remain one and a half games behind Oklahoma City (58-12) for the NBA's best overall record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-0 run to open the second half lifted the Cavs ahead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got some stops and then got in transition and made some shots. That helped," Mitchell said. "This is a great win. Now we're got to continue to take care of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Filipowski led Utah with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Detroit, rookie forward Ronald Holland scored 26 points off the bench to lead the Pistons over visiting New Orleans 136-130.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Duren added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, which improved to 40-32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons are two wins from their first winning season since 2016 as they seek a first playoff berth since 2019 and first playoff win since 2008.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Goalkeeper Mike Maignan saved twice in the shoot-out as France beat Croatia 5-4 on penalties after their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate, sealing a place in the last four in June.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus won 2-0 on the night with goals in normal time by Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembele at the Stade de France to wipe out their deficit from Thursday's first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  With no further scoring in extra time the tie went to penalties, where Maignan saved from both Martin Baturina and Josip Stanisic, while Franjo Ivanovic also missed his kick for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez both failed to convert for the hosts, but Dayot Upamecano scored when he became the seventh France player to step up, sparking scenes of celebrations on the pitch and in the crowd of 77,502.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who won the Nations League in 2021, will now take on title-holders Spain in the semi-finals in Germany on June 5, with the winners going through to the final three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile Croatia, who lost on penalties to Spain in the final of the last edition of the Nations League in 2023, will now start their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will go into qualifying Group L with the Czech Republic, Montenegro, the Faroe Islands and Gibraltar.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's progress to the final stages of the Nations League means they will not begin their World Cup qualifying campaign until September, when they will be in Group D with Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Nations League holders Spain reached the final four with a 5-4 win on penalties against the Netherlands, after a thrilling 3-3 quarter-final second leg draw had left the tie 5-5 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donyell Malen missed and Barcelona's Pedri slotted home to settle a gripping match in which the Netherlands came from behind three times to force the shoot-out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Oyarzabal opened the scoring for Spain but Memphis Depay levelled from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed Spain's second before Ian Maatsen rifled home to force extra-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal, who also missed a penalty in the shoot-out, scored a brilliant goal to put Spain ahead but Xavi Simons netted another spot-kick to force penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so nice to wear this shirt and to be able to score this goal," Pedri said, with his side facing France in the semi-finals. "We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Spain's struggles in Rotterdam on Thursday in the 2-2 first-leg draw, coach Luis de la Fuente made a handful of changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal and Dani Olmo came in for Alvaro Morata and Pedri, while Dean Huijsen made his first start, against the country of his birth, and excelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman brought in debutant Maatsen at left-back, giving him the unenviable challenge of shackling 17-year-old prodigy Yamal at Valencia's sold-out Mestalla stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's success in recent years has inspired their supporters and over 20,000 watched them train ahead of the second leg, which also served as a fundraiser for damage caused by the devastating storms which hit the Valencia region last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won a penalty early on when Jan Paul van Hecke clumsily brought down Oyarzabal, who scored the winning goal for La Roja in the Euro 2024 final last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Sociedad forward took it himself, smashing into the bottom right corner, past Bart Verbruggen's dive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal had a goal ruled out for offside and the Brighton goalkeeper denied Nico Williams with a superb stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 19, was jeered by the travelling Dutch fans, upset he did not choose to play for them, but Spain supporters backed him in response and he shone. (AFP)

    Filipino teenager Eala sends Keys packing in Miami

<img alt="Eala is the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since 1975. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797077_1_20250324055913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala, the 2022 U.S. Open girls' singles champion, who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growing up it was tough," Eala said in her on-court interview. "You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think – I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat – and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success," said the American.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break. (AFP)

    Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen wins 1,500m in Nanjing

<img alt="Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen celebrates after winning the men’s 1500m final during the Indoor World Athletics Championships in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797058_1_20250323214422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m in Nanjing on Sunday to claim not only a first global gold in his favoured distance, but also a rare world indoor track distance double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, who had won the 3,000m on Saturday for his first world indoor title, clocked 3min 38.79sec to emulate the double claimed by Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie in Maebashi in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Neil Gourley took silver in 3:39.07 while American Luke Houser rounded out the podium (3:39.17).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is something special," said Ingebrigtsen, before adding: "A lot of things have changed and I'm not doing this because anyone else has done it before. So that's purely a coincidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to compare yourself against history and what others are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm only focusing on myself and I feel good to have done a lot of preparations, and that was always the main goal. It's not to do with something somebody else did before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I can do more, so I'll try to maximise that and grab the opportunity given to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen's victory also banished some of the Norwegian's 1,500m demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main goal is obviously to win both distances, but I would say so far a pretty good indoor season, getting out and succeeding with the things that I wanted to accomplish, so it's been good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, as his wont, was happy to sit at the back of the nine-strong pack as American Samuel Prakel took up the running in Nanjing, splitting the pack into single file.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian moved to the front with four laps to run, Britain's Gourley on his shoulder and Mariano Garcia of Spain also in the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen surged again, shouldering off Austrian veteran Raphael Pallitsch's clumsy attempt at a pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to try their luck was Portugal's Isaac Nader, but at the bell it was Ingebrigtsen in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gourley raced down the inside line of the far straight, but there was to be no Briton to spoil the party at the line, as there has been twice at the world outdoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian kept not only his speed but also his nerve to see off his rivals, crossing the finish line with a brief look over his shoulder and a wagging index finger. (AFP)

    Reed qualifies for British Open after Macau finish

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Masters champion Patrick Reed qualified for the British Open after coming second behind fellow LIV player Carlos Ortiz at the International Series Macau on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican Ortiz also earned his spot at the major in Portrush, Northern Ireland, in July, after holding off the American for a three-shot victory at the Asian Tour event in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Kokrak also qualified as he finished third at Macau Golf and Country Club, three shots further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was one shot ahead of the 2017 Masters champion and another LIV player in Sergio Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard missed a three-footer for birdie on the last which would have seen him tie with Kokrak and secure a place at the British Open through countback based on his higher world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau tournament was added this year to the Open Qualifying Series for the first time, with the top three players who are not already exempt earning a berth at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  LIV players do not earn world-ranking points, severely restricting their chances of qualifying for golf's four major tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ortiz carded a final-round six-under-par 64 to triumph with a total 22-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, had shared the lead with Ortiz heading into the final round but had to settle for a runner-up finish after carding a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed's best performance at the British Open was 10th in 2019. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ticket sales for the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens are breaking records less than one week before the event kicks off at the Kai Tak Sports Park, according to the event's organiser.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated mega event will take place from March 28 to 30 at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China Rugby said 43,000 tickets have been sold, including 8,000 in the past week alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a capacity of 47,000, that means over 90 percent of all tickets have been snapped up. Only three-day passes remain, with each adult ticket costing HK$1,950.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser expects a total attendance of 138,000 over three days, a new record for the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby said the SAR squad is ready to compete, and is excited to be entering a new era of rugby history with the move away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Hong Kong, China teams have reached great heights both on the world stage and in the neighborhoods across the city. We look forward to together capitalising on the new opportunities presented by Kai Tak for our community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's and women's squads will be competing in the Melrose Claymores, a tournament which runs in parallel to the main Sevens competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's team will be aiming to defend their Melrose title, facing China on Friday and Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the women's team, who finished as runners-up to China last year, will play Kazakhstan on the opening day and Thailand next.

<img alt="McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix with second placed McLaren's Lando Norris and third placed Mercedes' George Russell. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797037_1_20250323172831.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri led from pole to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren used a one-stop strategy to complete a dominant one-two with Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  George Russell was third in a Mercedes with Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen snatching fourth place after a thrilling late pass on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton came home sixth behind his teammate after his first Ferrari victory in Saturday's sprint race in Shanghai, when Piastri had been second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an incredible weekend, the car has been pretty mega," said the Australian Piastri, who had been running second a week ago in Melbourne' season-opener before a late spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very, very happy. The hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, so to go all the way to the end was a bit of a surprise, but a happy surprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris had to cope with a late brake issue which forced him to settle for second rather than challenge his teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton continues to lead the championship after two race weekends on 44 points from Verstappen on 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell started from second and knew it was imperative to try to grab the lead off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead he was squeezed by Piastri on the long first bend complex, which allowed Norris to surge past into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ferraris got past Verstappen on the same bend, relegating the world champion from fourth to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc lost part of his front wing when it brushed Hamilton's rear right wheel but it did not affect his pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton was the first of the front-runners to dive in for new rubber on lap 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the others followed for hard tyres with Russell getting past Norris in the melee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the McLaren showed superior pace and surged back past at the end of the pit straight with the help of DRS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton began to struggle on the hard compound and allowed his teammate past on lap 21 freeing Leclerc to go after Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 38 Hamilton had to pit again for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front five all stayed out as it became clear they were going to attempt to make the hard tyres last till the end of the 56 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen had nursed his tyres throughout the race which enabled him to have a late charge on Leclerc and pass the Ferrari at the start of lap 54.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haas finished with two cars in the points as Esteban Ocon was seventh and rookie Ollie Bearman 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other points scorers were Mercedes teenager Kimi Antonelli in eighth with Alex Albon ninth in his Williams on his 29th birthday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong tennis star Coleman Wong pulled off the biggest triumph of his career in dramatic fashion, defeating 13th seed Ben Shelton of the United States at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old wildcard prevailed 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 in a thrilling three setter, despite letting slip a 5-2 lead in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always trust myself to play in these big stages," an emotional Wong said after the match. "This is for you Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182th in the world, becomes the second-lowest ranked player to reach the tournament's last 32 in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He already made history by beating world number 82 Daniel Altmaier of Germany in the first round, becoming the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's top men's player will next face Australia's Adam Walton, the lucky loser who's also enjoying a magical run at the prestigious Masters 1000 event.

<img alt="Now in his third season in Formula One, the Australian already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796987_1_20250323065602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pumped Oscar Piastri seized his first Formula One pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday and said he had done the hairpin of his life to smash the Shanghai circuit record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Australian, who had previously only secured the top slot for 100km sprint races, told reporters his qualifying time of one minute 30.641 seconds was secured at the end of the straight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My first lap was honestly better than my second lap, but just at the hairpin at the end of the straight I lost a bit of time and didn’t do the best hairpin," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the second lap I was about two-tenths down on myself, so I kind of just went 'why not send it into the hairpin?' and I gained those two-tenths back and then found a little bit more in the last corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, without that, I was tempted to box (pit) before that. So I’m pretty happy now that I didn’t...I just did a good corner, that’s all."
  <br>
  <br>
  As he told his team over the radio, it was "the hairpin of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  Now in his third season in Formula One, Piastri already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite for a third on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would make up for the crushing disappointment of starting on the front row in his home race in Melbourne last weekend and sliding off while chasing winning team mate Lando Norris before finishing ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris leads the championship on 26 points, with Piastri level with Ferrari's sprint winner Lewis Hamilton on nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pole was the first for an Australian driver since Daniel Ricciardo for Red Bull in Mexico in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a racing driver, so I'm selfish. So it's nice to do it for myself but it is also nice to do it for Australia as well," said the 23-year-old, who added that he has Chinese heritage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pole position is a really good confidence boost. It’s obviously my first one. So it's always nice to tick that box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a good start to the whole year for both the team and myself, even if the points tally doesn’t look like that at the moment. So (I'm) happy with how things are going, and this is a nice step along the way." (Reuters)

<img alt="Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant soars above Cleveland Cavaliers forward De'Andre Hunter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796939_1_20250322180740.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin Durant scored 42 points as the Phoenix Suns reignited their playoff hopes with a 123-112 upset of the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A superb performance from Durant secured a third straight victory for Phoenix as they aim to muscle their way into the postseason picture in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Durant erupted for 19 points in a third-quarter burst of scoring that took the game beyond Cleveland's grasp, with the Suns opening up a 98-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter which they never looked like letting slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Phoenix into 10th place in the Western Conference and into the play-in tournament reckoning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in each NBA conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while teams placed from 7th to 10th play in a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the best team in the league," Durant said of Cleveland following the Suns win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been struggling and we know we've got the toughest schedule for the last 10 games," he added. "So we just wanted to dial in and make sure we kept building on the work we've done over the last week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's fourth consecutive loss leaves the second-placed Boston Celtics just five wins behind the Cavs at the top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 51-19 after thrashing the Utah Jazz 121-99 on the back of 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis and 26 points from Jayson Tatum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Detroit Pistons' progress towards the playoffs suffered a jolt in a surprising 123-117 defeat on the road to the struggling Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs – whose season has been blown off course by the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers and a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving – powered to a precious victory thanks to 31 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 27 from PJ Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves Dallas perched on the edge of playoff contention in 11th place with a 34-37 record in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit occupy the sixth and last automatic playoff berth in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the loss, the Pistons will fancy their chances of locking down a postseason ticket given a vastly superior record – 39-32 – to seventh-placed Atlanta (33-36).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their successful clinching of the number 1 seeding on Thursday with a ruthless 141-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder were assured of top spot in the West despite not playing on Thursday after the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat to Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points as no fewer than eight OKC players finished in double figures in a wire-to-win which leaves the Thunder with a 58-12 record at the top of the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said he wanted to see his team play with the same intensity for the remainder of the regular season as they build towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got to play with a sense of purpose – you can't coast into the postseason," Daigneault said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great 48-minute effort. We played to our standards on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  With OKC already assured of top spot, Houston boosted their hopes of clinching second place in the West after rallying from 11 points down to squeeze past the Miami Heat, winning 102-98 on the road to bag their ninth consecutive win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet was the key man for Houston, finishing with 37 points after a devastating exhibition of long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  VanVleet drained nine-of-11 attempts from outside the arc as the Rockets improved to 46-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves remain hard on the heels of the sixth-placed Golden State Warriors (41-29) in the race for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves, who are one place behind Golden State, improved to 41-31 after a 134-93 pasting of the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another upset, the Portland Trail Blazers outgunned the injury-hit Denver Nuggets 128-109. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton dominated from pole position to take his maiden victory for Ferrari in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, on just his second race weekend for the Scuderia, took the chequered flag ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton emerged from his car after the finish line to a crescendo of cheers from the massed Shanghai fans who unfurled huge banners displaying the Englishman's number 44.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people underestimate the steep climb it is to get into a new team, understand a new team," said a delighted Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it is great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car as in Melbourne I really didn't feel comfortable in the car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt great today, I got a good start. I don't feel the pressure, I know the team wants to win and it means everything to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rome wasn't built in a day, so one day at a time."
  <br>
  <br>
  His former teammate at Mercedes, George Russell, was fourth and his current teammate Charles Leclerc was fifth in the other Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda in an RB was sixth, Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes was seventh and championship leader Lando Norris, who struggled for pace, took a solitary point in eighth for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton got away safely from pole after setting a blistering lap record on Friday at the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of lap three he was 1.1 seconds ahead and out of DRS range from Verstappen with Piastri a further 1.6 seconds back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris started sixth but was caught up in traffic on turn five and dropped to ninth, outside the points, as he was passed by Antonelli, Tsunoda and Lance Stroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell took advantage of the melee to nip past Leclerc into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen ran in second but was put under huge pressure by Piastri with five laps to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of my front tyres are dead," the Dutch reigning world champion complained on team radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 16 Piastri got past Verstappen at the hairpin and set off after Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian could not make inroads and the Englishman managed his tyres to perfection in the clean air at the front of the field. (AFP)

    Boxing legend George Foreman dies aged 76

<img alt="The former heavyweight boxing champion is renowned for his iconic battle with Muhammad Ali. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796902_1_20250322102434.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who fought and lost against Muhammad Ali in boxing's iconic 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday aged 76, his family announced in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family said in a statement posted on the boxer's official Instagram page.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Texas on January 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in Houston. The man who raised him was frequently absent and often drunk. Foreman only found out that J. D. Foreman was not his biological father after he won the world heavyweight when his real father, a decorated Second World War veteran, got in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an adolescent Foreman flirted with crime and dropped out of school at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood," his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024. "And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 16, he took up boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to a football player," Foreman said on his website. "I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Mexico Games in 1968, the 19-year-old Foreman bludgeoned his way to the super-heavyweight gold. As he celebrated his final victory, 10 days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos had made a black power salute following the 200m track final, Foreman waved an American flag in the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 6-foot-4 (1.93m), 'Big George' was larger and stronger than the other leading heavyweights of the time. He was light on his feet, but slugged his way through the professional ranks, to earn a heavyweight title shot against champion Joe Frazier, demolishing the champion in two rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the time he fought his third title defence over 15 rounds against Ali in October 1974 in Kinshasa, Foreman was unbeaten in 40 professional bouts. He had won all but three inside the distance and had not needed to develop stamina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ali's 'rope-a-dope' tactics, exhausted the big man who lost in eight rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat punctured Foreman's intimidating aura, not least, in his own mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title," he said later. "It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign for another title shot ended when he lost on points to another contender, Jimmy Young in March 1977 on a hot night in Puerto Rico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman fell ill after the fight and said he sensed God telling him to change his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  He retired, aged 28 and became an ordained minister. When he announced his comeback 10 years later, bald where he had once sported an afro and flabby instead of chiseled, it seemed like a boxing gimmick. He wrote later that he needed money for his youth centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Knockout -
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three years he fought 21 times, mostly against mediocre opponents, winning every bout, 20 of them inside the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A big name in a weakened and fragmented division, he earned a title shot against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and then against Tommy Morrison two years later, losing both on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 1994 he faced Michael Moorer, who had dethroned Holyfield. In the same shorts he had worn 20 years and six days earlier against Ali, Foreman was trailing badly when he caught Moorer on the chin in the 10th for a knockout. At 45 years and 299 days old he was the oldest heavyweight world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of first his WBA title and then his IBF title for refusing to fight nominated opponents but won three more fights and was still 'lineal' world champion when he lost on points to Shannon Briggs in 1997, aged 48, and retired again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He fought 81 times as a professional, winning 76, 68 of those by a knockout.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, he put his name to the "George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine", appearing smiling and friendly in the TV ads, becoming a celebrity outside boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman, who hosted a 1996 TV programme 'Bad Dads', married four times, fathering 10 children and adopting two.
  <br>
  <br>
  He named all his five sons George Edward, explaining that he wanted them to know, "'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!'" (AFP)

    Tuchel starts his reign as England coach with a win

<img alt="England beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796888_1_20250322075914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel made a winning start to his England reign without delivering on his promise of a vibrant new era as the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel had urged England to play without fear after claiming they were "afraid" in a scathing assessment of their Euro 2024 runners-up finish under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the early returns were underwhelming as Tuchel's side dominated possession at Wembley without providing much entertainment for the sell-out 82,378 crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is far too early to judge Tuchel, the German -- England's third non-British manager -- must know significant improvements are needed on the road to next year's World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18 years and 176 days, Myles Lewis-Skelly made history in the first half when the Arsenal defender became the youngest player to score on his England debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the highlight of an inconsistent England display which was hard to distinguish from the erratic fare served up by Southgate during his eight years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Harry Kane, who played under Tuchel at Bayern Munich last season, netted late in the second half to put a more flattering gloss on the Group K opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old's 70th international goal came just 24 hours after England's record scorer claimed people were "bored" of his achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel was greeted with a banner unfurled by fans with the slogan "Welcome to the home of football Thomas" as he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  True to his word, Tuchel did not sing the English national anthem after saying he had to "earn the right" and there were few songs of praise for Tuchel as Wembley started to empty well before the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel, whose side host Latvia on Monday, at least avoiding become the first England boss since Bobby Robson in 1982 to fail to win his first match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel gave debuts to Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn, who scored in Sunday's League Cup final win at Wembley, while Marcus Rashford was given a starting berth after his revival on loan at Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three looked comfortable in Tuchel's 4-2-3-1 formation but England could only muster a workmanlike start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel stood in the technical area making occasional notes and clapping vigorously when England followed his demand for a high press to win the ball back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was even more animated in the 20th minute as his decision to select Lewis-Skelly paid rich dividends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jude Bellingham was the catalyst as he deftly turned to find space in midfield before stroking a sublime pass towards Lewis-Skelly, who timed his run perfectly to slot home from close-range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel pumped his arms in celebration, with a sheepish grin spreading across his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smile was nearly wiped from his face when Burn's miscued block from Qazim Laci's cross hit the bar in a panicked sequence that ended with the defender heading off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham's diving header was repelled by Thomas Strakosha before Kane's follow-up was brilliantly blocked by Berat Djimsiti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn almost reprised his Wembley goal against Liverpool last weekend with a towering header that clanged off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel's hope that England would play with more intensity wasn't helped by the soporific atmosphere, a stark contrast the Premier League passion he wants his team to emulate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane headed narrowly wide from Bellingham's cross after the interval, but England laboured to kill off an Albania side content to sit deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finally landed the knockout blow in the 77th minute as Declan Rice's cross reached Kane and he swivelled to curl into the far corner from 10 yards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opener Hasan Nawaz struck a record-breaking maiden century on Friday as Pakistan crushed New Zealand by nine wickets in the third Twenty20 to keep the series alive.
 <br>
  <br>
  After scoring a duck in each of the two opening games – the first innings of his international career – Nawaz rebounded with a stunning 105 not out in Auckland as the tourists raced to 207-1 in response to New Zealand's 204.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old's ton came off 44 balls, the fastest by any Pakistan player in a T20 international.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ensured his team reached the target with four full overs to spare, in a stark reversal of form after heavy losses in Christchurch and Dunedin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nawaz put his early failures behind him with a sparkling knock featuring shots all around the wicket, including a series of audacious ramp shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  He admitted he was worried about his selection prospects after two failures and thanked captain Salman Agha and vice-captain Shadab Khan for showing faith in his ability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way I got out in the first two matches, I was very disheartened, but the captain and Shadab supported me, told me I am a match-winning player and that helped me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to score my first run in international cricket, that's what I was thinking. After I scored one run, the pressure was released and I wanted to win the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander peppered the short Eden Park boundaries with 10 fours and seven sixes, bringing up victory with successive fours off Kyle Jamieson in the 16th over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of those shots took Nawaz to 100, five balls faster than the previous Pakistan record-holder – Babar Azam against South Africa in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow opener Mohammad Haris scored 41 off 20 while captain Salman Agha was unbeaten on 51 off 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell conceded they had few answers to halt Nawaz.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to tip your hat to Nawaz there, the way that he played was unbelievable," Bracewell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty tough to defend out here but when a guy plays like that, it's really tough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, New Zealand looked well placed after Mark Chapman hit a rapid 94 before they were dismissed in their final over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, tallying 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rest of the home side's batsmen struggled to get going, aside from Bracewell's 31.
  <br>
  <br>
  Experienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan's best figures of 3-29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game four of the five-match series is in Mount Maunganui on Sunday. (AFP)

<img alt="Lewis Hamilton in a Ferrari during the sprint qualifier. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796819_1_20250321175331.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A "gobsmacked" Lewis Hamilton obliterated the Shanghai lap record to take a stunning pole position on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix sprint in only his second race weekend with Ferrari.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, who has won a record six Chinese Grands Prix, flew round the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit in 1min 30.849sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lap easily beat the 1:32.238 set in 2004 at the inaugural Chinese GP by fellow seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, also in a Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reigning world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who won both the sprint and main race in China last year, was second fastest 0.018sec behind and McLaren's Oscar Piastri was third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Charles Leclerc was fourth as Ferrari showed a big improvement from Melbourne, where Hamilton was 10th and Leclerc eighth -- the Scuderia's worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just a bit gobsmacked, taken back by it. I didn't know when we would get to this position," said Hamilton, who emerged from his car to a huge ovation from the Chinese fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I started out straight away with a better feeling in the car. I can't believe we are at the front, ahead of a McLaren which has been so fast throughout winter testing, Australia and even today."
  <br>
  <br>
  A big surprise was Melbourne winner Lando Norris, whose McLaren had been fastest by almost half a second in morning practice ahead of Leclerc, Piastri and Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris was sixth after he ran wide and aborted his final flying lap.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I made a mistake. I locked up in the last corner," admitted Norris, who complained his car was not to his liking.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just too many mistakes but just too difficult of a car to drive," the Englishman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen said he was fortunate to be second on the grid for the sprint race.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lap was very good. I don't even think we should have been on the front row anyway so I'm very happy to be second," said the four-time world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell was fifth with his teammate Kimi Antonelli seventh behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda's RB, Alex Albon's Williams and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin rounded out the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari team principal Fred Vasseur said it was difficult to understand the difference between Friday's sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes McLaren had a huge gap, sometimes not so. Let's analyse it. We have a lot of work to do," Vasseur told Sky Sports F1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For sure it's a good feeling and gives a positive energy to the team and Lewis, but I always see the negative side."
  <br>
  <br>
  All the cars were obligated to run medium-compound tyres in the first two sprint qualifying sessions, termed SQ1 and SQ2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull rookie Liam Lawson had a bad start to his weekend, failing to get out of the first session after having a lap time deleted for exceeding track limits and the New Zealander will start 20th and last.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated after the first session were the Alpine pair of Jack Doohan and Pierre Gasly, Haas's Esteban Ocon and the Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  In SQ2, Fernando Alonso was 11th in the Aston Martin and missed out on the top-10 shootout.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also eliminated were Oliver Bearman's Haas, the Williams of Carlos Sainz, Gabriel Bortoleto in a Sauber and Isack Hadjar's RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the Chinese Grand Prix over 56 laps. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy's Olympic bronze medallist Andy Diaz Hernandez produced a stunning early effort of 17.8 metres to capture the triple jump gold medal in the first final of the world indoor athletics championships on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cuban-born European champion broke the Italian record with his first jump of the day and comfortably staved off his challengers, with China's Zhu Yaming taking the silver with a distance of 17.33 metres.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Almir Dos Santos grabbed the bronze with 17.22 metres, while defending champion Hugues Fabrice Zango of Burkina Faso only managed fourth place with 17.15 metres in Nanjing's Cube.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz Hernandez fouled in the second round before deciding not to take his third, fourth and fifth attempts. He returned for the sixth round, merely running through, however, soaking up the cheers from the crowd. (Reuters)

    Norris chalks up fastest practice lap in Chinese GP

<img alt="Mechanics work on Lando Norris' car in the pits during the first practice session of the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix at the Shanghai International Circuit. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796771_1_20250321132157.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris was fastest in practice on Friday for the Chinese Grand Prix, the championship leader lapping almost half a second quicker than Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri third.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton was fourth quickest as Ferrari bounced back from a dismal opening race in Australia last weekend to split the dominant McLaren duo ahead of sprint race qualifying later on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris won in Melbourne and McLaren would have had a one-two if not for Piastri's late spin, which handed defending four-time world champion Max Verstappen second in his Red Bull.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who won both the sprint race and the grand prix in Shanghai last year, struggled and aborted his final lap on soft tyres leaving him only 16th fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris clocked 1min 31.504sec around the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit, where long turns and heavy braking zones are notoriously punishing on tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was 0.454sec ahead of Leclerc with Piastri 0.195 further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conditions were a contrast to last weekend's wet and wild season-opener in Melbourne that saw several crashes and stints under the safety car.
  <br>
  <br>
  The session was the teams' only opportunity to hone their set-ups before Friday afternoon's sprint qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Times tumbled as the new asphalt rubbered in.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "big four" teams – Red Bull, McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes – all battled for early supremacy, swapping fastest times on the medium compound tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a much improved session for Ferrari after Melbourne, where the seven-time world champion Hamilton came home only 10th after the team strategists gambled and lost on leaving him out on slick tyres in rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc was eighth with Ferrari's five points representing their worst season-opening performance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Jack Doohan failed to complete a lap on his debut and had more woe in Shanghai when his Alpine lost power, bringing out the red flags 13 minutes from the end of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  At that point all the teams had run only on medium tyres.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the session resumed with eight minutes to go it saw a congested dash from the pit lane to record a qualifying simulation lap as everyone bolted on the faster softs.
  <br>
  <br>
  George Russell's Mercedes was fifth fastest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber was sixth, with Alex Albon's Williams, Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes and Yuki Tsunoda's RB making up the rest of the top 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-lap sprint race will take place on Saturday morning before grand prix qualifying later the same day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday sees the main race over 56 laps. (AFP)

    Vinicius dashes Colombia hopes with late winner

<img alt="Vinicius Jr and a teammate celebrate after the stoppage-time winner against Colombia at the Mane Garrincha stadium in Brasilia. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796760_1_20250321123836.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Vinicius Junior struck a dramatic winner in the ninth minute of stoppage time to give Brazil a 2-1 win over Colombia in their South American World Cup qualifier.
 <br>
  <br>
  The five-time world champions had taken a sixth-minute lead in Brasilia through a Raphinha penalty only for Luis Diaz's fine 41st-minute strike for Colombia to level the game on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia enjoyed the most pressure in the second half but were ultimately sunk by the Real Madrid winger's dramatic winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory leaves Brazil well positioned in second place in the 10-team CONMEBOL qualifying group, four points behind leaders Argentina who travel to Uruguay on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A foul from Daniel Munoz on Vinicius resulted in the early penalty for Brazil and Raphinha, taking a short run-up, confidently slotted home the spot-kick to give the home side an early lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But four minutes before the break, James Rodriguez found Liverpool's Diaz on the left and the winger moved inside before driving it home into the far, bottom corner of the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodriguez had an opening in the 68th minute, after a smart move from Colombia, but the playmaker's shot was comfortably dealt with by Alisson Becker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diaz's Liverpool team-mate Becker had to go off injured in the 78th minute, with an apparent concussion, after a collision with Colombia's Davinson Sanchez which resulted in the defender being stretchered off.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Colombia enjoyed the bulk of attacking possession, Brazil remained a threat and Guilherme Arana flashed a shot wide in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Alisson injury had created the lengthy stoppage time and Vinicius took advantage with his fiercely struck effort taking a slight deflection off a defender's head and flying in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's goal is a bit of relief, a bit of happiness. Playing for the national team is something you can't explain," said Vinicius.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every time we come here, it's like it's the first time".
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil face old rivals Argentina on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a bitter ending for a Colombia side who sit in sixth place still with work to do in qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kept Brazil in their half, I think we deserved more again, but that's the way it is. I have a lot of doubts about the refereeing decisions, which I'm not going to comment on," said Colombia coach Nestor Lorenzo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played a great game and came away with nothing again. We conceded a very early goal again," he lamented.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American qualifiers on Thursday, Paraguay beat bottom-placed Chile 1-0 in Asuncion, a result that left La Roja rooted to the bottom of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  Veteran 41-year-old striker Paolo Guerrero was on target as Peru beat Bolivia 3-1 to move off the bottom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andy Polo opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Guerrero found the target on the stroke of half-time. (AFP)
  <br>
  <br>
  Bolivia pulled one back with a Miguel Terceros penalty in the 58th minute before Edison Flores restored the two-goal cushion in the 82nd minute.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third seed Coco Gauff crushed fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-0 6-0 at the Miami Open, the former U.S. Open champion producing a flawless display to reach the third round.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gauff, aiming to win her maiden Miami title, won 84 percent of her first-serve points, saved the one break point she faced and converted six of her nine break points in the 47-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was definitely playing well today, and maybe she wasn't playing her peak great tennis," Gauff said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think anyone who is playing their best tennis will have that scoreline today, so I'm not going to sit here and say she played her best tennis."
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Gauff, who was eliminated in the round of 16 at Indian Wells last week, will be Ashlyn Krueger who stunned seventh seed Elena Rybakina 6-4 2-6 6-4 for the first top-10 win of her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed and two-times Grand Slam champion Aryna Sabalenka, playing her first match since losing to Mirra Andreeva in the Indian Wells final, broke Bulgarian Viktoriya Tomova six times en route to a 6-3 6-0 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will face qualifier Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the third round after the Bulgarian advanced with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Polish 29th seed Magdalena Frech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen also advanced, and Canada's Leylah Fernandez beat American Alycia Parks 7-6(1) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Naomi Osaka beat 24th seed Liudmila Samsonova 6-2 6-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the men's side, Reilly Opelka earned his first ATP Masters 1000 win since 2022 with a 6-3 7-6(4) triumph over American wild card Christopher Eubanks and will face Indian Wells finalist Holger Rune in the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's Bu Yunchaokete beat Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-2 without facing a break point and qualifiers Jacob Fearnley and Thiago Agustin Tirante also advanced.
  <br>

  <br>
  "My body has not recovered enough from the matches last week. I will now go home and get ready for the clay court season," Nishikori said. (Reuters)

<img alt="McLaren's Lando Norris arrives in Shanghai atop the drivers’ standings for the first time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796732_1_20250321100549.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 McLaren’s dominance, Lewis Hamilton’s bid to bounce back after a disappointing debut for Ferrari, and the passing of Eddie Jordan have generated headlines as Formula 1 prepares for its first "Sprint weekend" of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lando Norris arrived in Shanghai on top of the drivers’ standings for the first time following his win at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix last Sunday, but it was his qualifying pace for McLaren – and not just holding off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen – that had his rivals on edge ahead of practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes driver George Russell went so far as to say McLaren could win every race this season, describing its raw pace advantage as “bigger than Red Bull has ever had”.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, while Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri strongly refuted the claim — stating the form would change between rounds – the rest of the paddock wasn’t so sure.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They're definitely ahead,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The gap in qualifying, the gap that there was in Australia is more or less what there is."
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think we are around Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of lap times if we put everything together," Leclerc said, "so there’s still a big chunk to get McLaren then.”
  <br>
  <br>
  For seven-time world champion Hamilton, meanwhile, China is a chance for a reset after a difficult Ferrari debut at Melbourne’s Albert Park last weekend, where he qualified eighth, briefly took the lead, but couldn’t hold onto it because of the team's tire strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 40-year-old, who is F1's most successful driver with a record 105 GP wins and 104 pole positions, says he still needs more time to bring the full force of his experience to his new team.
  <br>
  <br>
  “As I get more comfortable and more knowledgeable about the car, I can start making more decisions,” Hamilton said of his preferred set up. “I’m having those discussions, and I’m going to lean a little bit more with adding my experience hopefully a bit more in it.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton is hopeful that the Australian GP was an outlier for him and for Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope so,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think our car looked pretty decent in Australia and even on Saturday morning. So, I think it’s a bit of a one-off.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Saudi Arabia in a Fifa 2026 World Cup qualifying match on Thursday, leaving it struggling at the bottom of Group C in the Asian zone.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decisive moment came five minutes into the second half when Saudi midfielder Salem Al-Dawsari scored from close range, capitalising on a rebound after Chinese goalkeeper Wang Dalei blocked an initial shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's task became even more challenging just before the break when Lin Liangming was shown a red card for a reckless kick to the face of Saudi defender Hassan Kadish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident resulted in a lengthy stoppage as Kadish received treatment before being carried off the field on a stretcher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite dominating possession, the hosts were unable to convert their chances, with a first-half goal by Faisel Al-Ghamdi ruled out by video footage for handball, further compounding their frustrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  After seven matches, China remains at the bottom of Group C with just six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will next take on Australia at home on Tuesday and will look to turn their fortunes around. (Xinhua)

    Perisic stars as Croatia stun France in Nations League

<img alt="Croatia's Ivan Perisic celebrates after scoring his team's second goal against France. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796706_1_20250321061557.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ivan Perisic scored one goal and made another as Croatia beat France 2-0 to seize the upper hand in the first leg of their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Perisic crossed for Ante Budimir to head in the opener at the Stadion Poljud in Split after the home side had squandered an early penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  With France out of sorts, Perisic made it 2-0 before the break and a Croatia side captained by Luka Modric saw out the victory to take to Paris for the return match on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not a good night for France as captain Kylian Mbappe made his comeback having not featured in either of the last two international windows, in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappe did have chances, notably seeing a deflected second-half shot from Ousmane Dembele's cutback kept out by a fine Dominik Livakovic save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid superstar has now failed to find the net in his last six appearances for his country, since scoring a penalty in a 1-1 draw with Poland at Euro 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus will now have to find a way of overturning the deficit at the Stade de France on Sunday, otherwise Croatia will be heading to the final four of the Nations League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals and final will take place in June and will be hosted by either Italy or Germany, depending on which of those sides emerges victorious from their last-eight encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won the Nations League in 2021 but suffered a first ever defeat against Croatia in the group stage of the following year's edition.
  <br>
  <br>
  This latest repeat of the 2018 World Cup final, won 4-2 by the French in Moscow, saw Croatia win a spot-kick just five minutes in.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool centre-back Ibrahima Konate was penalised for a blatant handball inside the area, but Mike Maignan saved Andrej Kramaric's penalty after a long delay due to the goalkeeper having a laser pen shone in his eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Croatia did get the breakthrough on 26 minutes as Budimir, who has 15 goals in La Liga this season for Osasuna, got in front of William Saliba to connect with a Perisic cross from the left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Budimir's header was blocked by Maignan, but the ball still spun into the net in cruel fashion for the goalkeeper.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was 2-0 in first-half stoppage time as Saliba blocked a shot by Martin Baturina, only for the ball to fall for PSV Eindhoven veteran Perisic to fire in.
  <br>
  <br>
  France made changes, sending on Dayot Upamecano for Konate at the restart and later bringing on Bradley Barcola for Randal Kolo Muani and Michael Olise for Dembele.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter spent more time on the right flank after the break having previously been deployed more centrally.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they could not get a goal back and now face a daunting task in trying to recover the tie. (AFP)

    NBA's Boston Celtics sold for record US$6.1 billion

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA's Boston Celtics are being sold to the head of a California private equity firm for US$6.1 billion, a record price for a US sports franchise, according to reports by The Boston Globe.
 <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper, citing a league source, said the Celtics ownership had agreed to sell the iconic team to William Chisholm, managing director and co-founder of Symphony Technology Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the US$6.1 billion purchase price is the highest ever offered for a North American sports team, surpassing the US$6.05 billion paid for the NFL's Washington Commanders in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of the Celtics, the current NBA champions, still requires the approval of the NBA Board of Governors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team is one of the most storied in the league's history, with a record 18 championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, is a longtime fan of the team, according to the Globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the new ownership group also includes current Celtics co-owner Robert Hale; Bruce Beal Jr., president of Related Companies; and the global investment firm, Sixth Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newspaper said three other buyers had been under consideration: Steve Pagliuca, a Celtics co-owner; Stan Middleman, a co-owner of MLB's Philadelphia Phillies; and The Friedkin Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Grousbeck family and Pagliuca purchased the Celtics for US$360 million in 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three NBA teams were sold in 2023 – the Phoenix Suns for US$4 billion, the Milwaukee Bucks for US$3.5 billion and the Dallas Mavericks for US$3.5 billion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry became the first woman and African to be elected president of the International Olympic Committee on Thursday declaring it to be an "extraordinary moment."
 <br>
  <br>
  At 41, the two-time Olympic swimming champion is also the youngest ever elected to be the most powerful person in sports governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  She succeeds Thomas Bach, who steps down after 12 years, and said she would work with the six other heavyweight rivals she beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year-old girl I never thought that I would be standing up here one day, getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours," Coventry said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not just a huge honour but it is a reminder to every single one of you that I will lead this organisation with so much pride, with the values at the core and I will make all of you very, very proud and, I hope, extremely confident in the decision you've taken today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
  <br>
  <br>
  Coventry, who was strongly believed to be Bach's favoured candidate, was thought to be in a tight-run race with IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior and World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, to general surprise, the race was over after the first round of voting a majority of the 100-plus IOC members placing their faith in her to meet the serious challenges that lie ahead. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan became the first team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup after second-half goals from Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo gave them a 2-0 win over Bahrain on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The runaway Asian Group C leaders failed to sparkle on a chilly night in Saitama until Crystal Palace forward Kamada pounced for the opener in the 66th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo added another in the 87th minute as Japan punched their ticket to next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will be their eighth straight World Cup appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's 5-1 home win over Indonesia earlier in the evening meant Japan would have clinched their place even with a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Kamada made sure they did it in style in front of an expectant crowd of just under 60,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  He latched onto Kubo's reverse pass and dispatched the ball past Bahrain goalkeeper Ebrahim Lutfalla just three minutes after coming on as a substitute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Kubo added some extra gloss to the night with a left-footed shot from a tight angle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's players sprinted onto the pitch at the final whistle and celebrated with the home supporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan have been in unstoppable form in the Asian third round of qualifiers and went into the game having won five and drawn one of their games so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Hajime Moriyasu started with an experienced line-up featuring Premier League talent in Liverpool's Wataru Endo and Brighton's Kaoru Mitoma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Captain Endo thought he had given his team the lead in the ninth minute when he rammed home a loose ball in the box, only for the goal to be disallowed by VAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan continued to press for the opener but Bahrain had several dangerous raids on the counterattack and Komail Al Aswad should have done better just after the half-hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan were also wasteful and Mitoma blazed over the bar with the goal at his mercy in first-half injury time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Moriyasu shuffled his pack midway through the second half, bringing on Kamada and Junya Ito for Takumi Minamino and Ritsu Doan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impact was immediate as Kamada gave Japan the lead with his ninth goal for his country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kubo went close to adding another with a curling shot that Lutfalla clawed away with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the attacker got his goal with time running out as Japan made sure of the win, and with it a place in North America. (AFP)

<img alt="Eddie Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called 'quite aggressive' cancer of the bladder and prostate. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796629_1_20250320172623.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ex-Formula 1 team owner and media personality Eddie Jordan has died, according to his family. He was 76.
 <br>
  <br>
  He ran his own Jordan team in the 1990s and 2000s in F1 and became a popular pundit on TV after selling the team in 2005.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan had been undergoing treatment for what he had called “quite aggressive” cancer of the bladder and prostate, which spread to his spine and pelvis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The family said in a statement Jordan “passed away peacefully with family by his side in Cape Town” early on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “EJ brought an abundance of charisma, energy and Irish charm everywhere he went. We all have a huge hole missing without his presence. He will be missed by so many people, but he leaves us with tonnes of great memories to keep us smiling through our sorrow.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish businessman Jordan operated his own racing team in lower-level series before moving up to F1 in 1991, giving future seven-time champion Michael Schumacher his first race that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other drivers over the years included Damon Hill, who won the 1996 championship with Williams, future Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was third in the championship for Jordan in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jordan Grand Prix won four races before Jordan sold the team in 2005. Following more sales and name changes since then, the team competes as Aston Martin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 76-year-old Jordan also acted as the manager for car design great Adrian Newey when he left Red Bull for Aston Martin last year. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic raced to the 200th 30-point game of his career as the Los Angeles Lakers took advantage of an under-strength Denver Nuggets line-up to score a 120-108 victory over their Western Conference rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Slovenian star Doncic, once again spearheading the Lakers offence in the absence of the injured LeBron James, rattled in 31 points, with nine rebounds and seven assists as the Lakers cruised to a wire-to-wire win on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets, missing Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, were never in the hunt after Doncic poured in 21 points in the first quarter alone as the Lakers sprinted into an early 46-29 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers maintained a double-digit cushion for most of the remainder of the game, with Austin Reaves adding 22 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers improved to 43-25, leapfrogging Denver (44-26) into third place in the Western Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers in February in a shock trade from Dallas, has now scored 30 points or more in eight of his 16 games with the Lakers following his blockbuster move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, every day gets better," Doncic told ESPN following the win. "That's three wins in a row now so we've got to just keep it going.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We go game-by-game because if you think too far in the future maybe you forget about the next game. We know the (standings) are tight but we've just got to try and win every game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' victory ensured that the Oklahoma City Thunder must wait a little longer before clinching the No 1 seeding from the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could have sealed the top seed with a Lakers loss after dismantling the hapless Philadelphia 76ers 133-100 earlier Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder could afford to rest Most Valuable Player front-runner Shai Gilgeous-Alexander but were still far too strong for a Sixers team whose regular season is ending in disarray.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Sixers stars Joel Embiid and Paul George ruled out for the rest of the campaign and Tyrese Maxey missing with a lower back injury, the Thunder coasted to a blowout, wire-to-win after leading by as much as 41 points at one stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven Oklahoma City players finished in double figures with Aaron Wiggins topping the scoring with 26 points as the Thunder improved to 57-12, 12.5 games clear of the Houston Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The in-form Rockets meanwhile remained in second place in the West after rolling to their eighth straight win, a 116-108 victory on the road over the Orlando Magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Green led the Houston scorers with 26 points, Alperen Sengun providing offensive support with 22 points, 12 rebounds and four assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland slid to their third straight defeat in a 123-119 loss to the Sacramento Kings in California.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers fell to 56-13 after 27 points from the Kings DeMar DeRozan -- one of seven Sacramento players in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves' bid for a top six finish -- and an automatic playoff berth -- lost further momentum in a 119-115 home defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zion Williamson scored 29 points for New Orleans in what was only their seventh away win of the season. The Pelicans (19-51) are already eliminated from postseason contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was another sizeable upset in New York, where the San Antonio Spurs routed the Knicks 120-105 thanks to a sharp-shooting 34-point performance off the bench from Sandro Mamukelashvili.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 25-year-old New York-born Georgian centre rattled in a perfect seven-from-seven three-pointers in a blistering 19-minute spell.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio improved to 29-39 with the win to keep alive their faint chances of advancing to the Western Conference play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks are 43-25 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-placed Indiana Pacers meanwhile edged closer to the Knicks after staging a late rally to down the Dallas Mavericks 135-131.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers trailed by 11 points with six minutes remaining but conjured a late charge to snatch victory, with Pascal Siakam finishing on 29 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 23 points -- 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Kyrgios wins first match since 2022

<img alt="Nick Kyrgios hits a running shot against Mackenzie McDonald in Miami Open action at Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Geoff Burke-Imagn Images/Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796553_1_20250320103836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian Nick Kyrgios came from behind to defeat Mackenzie McDonald 3-6 6-3 6-4 in the first round of the Miami Open to earn his first win since October 2022.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kyrgios, who retired from his first-round match at Indian Wells this month due to pain in his surgically repaired right wrist, soaked in the moment on Wednesday, looking skyward and taking a deep breath after sealing the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a long journey even to get to the start line of matches and be scared to even be able to finish them," he told Tennis TV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So to come in and get a win and feel like I belong again, it's pretty special."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyrgios, who had lost all three matches he played this year, got off to a slow start on a hot and humid day in South Florida but after dropping the first set, he began to settle in, finding his rhythm on serve to level the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the decider, he hit a well-disguised drop shot to set up a break point and converted when his American opponent double-faulted to hand Kyrgios a 4-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  From there he rode his best shot, his booming serve, to the finish line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Kyrgios is Russian Karen Khachanov, who stunned the Australian in a hard-fought quarter-final at the 2022 US Open, a tournament Kyrgios was among the favourites to win that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soon after that bitter disappointment he would take a lengthy break from the court to tend to a series of knee, foot and wrist problems that threatened to permanently derail the 29-year-old's career before returning to the tour this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frenchman Gael Monfils, Belgian David Goffin, and Russian-born Kazakhstani Alexander Bublik were among the players who also advanced out of the first round with wins on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women's side, former US Open champion Emma Raducanu barely broke a sweat as she brushed aside Japanese wild card Sayaka Ishii 6-2 6-1 to reach the second round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raducanu, who was ousted in the first round at Indian Wells, regained her footing against Ishii as she won 77 percent of her first-serve points, fired down six aces and converted five of her six break point chances in the 65-minute match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Britain's Raducanu will be American world number 10 Emma Navarro, who won a WTA 500 event in Mexico in early March for her second career title before losing in the third round at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other women's action Belinda Bencic, fresh off a run to the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, overcame a 5-3 third-set deficit to beat Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska on Grandstand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss former world number four gave birth to her daughter Bella in April and won her first WTA title as a mother when she triumphed at the WTA 500 event in Abu Dhabi last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twice Grand Slam winner Victoria Azarenka strolled into the second round with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Ukrainian wild card Anhelina Kalinina in the evening session at Hard Rock Stadium. (Reuters)

    Edinburgh to host start of 2027 Tour de France

<img alt="The Red Bull–BORA–hansgrohe team at the 2024 Tour de France. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796524_1_20250320071819.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 2027 Tour de France will start in Edinburgh with the first three stages taking place in Scotland, England and Wales, the organisers ASO announced at a ceremony in the Scottish capital.
 <br>
  <br>
  The women's Tour de France will also start from Britain in 2027, from a location yet to be revealed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This will be the third men's start from the United Kingdom but the two previous Grand Departs both took place in England, making these the first stages ever to be raced in Scotland and Wales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first two stages of the 2007 edition were in London with Yorkshire hosting the start of the 2014 race.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to an official report, the Grand Depart of the 2014 race attracted 3.5 million spectators to the roadside as two stages took place in Yorkshire, with a third between Cambridge and London.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The popular success was absolutely phenomenal," Tour director Christian Prudhomme said. "We were faced with walls of people, a great mass of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Prudhomme said setting off from the "magical city" of Edinburgh was something he had in mind for some time but its remoteness had worked against it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scotland was already a candidate against Yorkshire for 2014 and one of the major differences at the time was the distance from France," added Prudhomme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But since then, there have been new UCI regulations which mean that, once every four years, we have a 'joker' to start on the Friday, which fundamentally changes the deal."
  <br>
  <br>
  The ASO organisers used the exemption in 2022 for the start in Copenhagen instead of a Saturday. They will use it again in 2027 to start on Friday July 2, 2027 for three complete stages on British soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Details of the cities have yet to be revealed, but the peloton will head straight for England, where the second stage will also take place. (AFP)

    Ohtani hits home run as Dodgers sweep Cubs in Tokyo

<img alt="Shohei Ohtani scores a home run at the Tokyo Dome. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796480_1_20250319221213.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani hit a home run but Roki Sasaki had a wobbly Major League Baseball debut as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 6-3 in Tokyo on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Ohtani thrilled another sold-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome when he blasted a one-run shot in the fifth inning as the World Series champion Dodgers completed a two-game season-opening sweep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese pitcher Sasaki showcased his ferocious fastball but struggled with his command in his first start since joining the Dodgers over the winter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old hit 60 kph with his first three pitches and struck out three batters but also gave up five walks in three innings on the mound.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tommy Edman and Kike Hernandez also hit home runs for the Dodgers, who beat the Cubs 4-1 in Tuesday's Game 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 40,000 fans erupted when Ohtani hit a home run to right centre field in his third trip to the plate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The call was reviewed but eventually upheld, giving fans an excuse to celebrate a second time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs walked Ohtani at his next at-bat, prompting loud boos from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is a national hero in Japan and his first visit with the Dodgers has been eagerly anticipated for months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were also waiting to see the hotly tipped Sasaki, whose father and grandparents were killed in Japan's 2011 tsunami.
  <br>
  <br>
  The right-hander got his first MLB strikeout against the Cubs' Japanese batter Seiya Suzuki, letting out a loud grunt as he launched another thunderous fastball.
  <br>
  <br>
  His command faltered as the game went on and he walked three batters in a row in the third inning before getting himself out of trouble with two straight strikeouts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Edman hit the Dodgers' first home run of the season off Cubs starting pitcher Justin Steele in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hernandez crushed another in the fourth inning, hitting the ball high into the stands with a massive shot. (AFP)

    Snooker tournament slips spur Rugby Sevens resolve

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sports chief Rosanna Law said on Wednesday that parties involved in the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament to be held later this month have to liaise and communicate closely for the Kai Tak event to be considered a success.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual extravaganza is moving to the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time, having been held at the Hong Kong Stadium for decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law's reassurance came after lawmakers in a Legislative Council meeting asked why officials, the sports park and organisers of a snooker tournament earlier this month had come up with different versions about wrong information given out to people at the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paul Tse cited incidents where spectators were told they had to leave before midnight and a sign wrongly showed that there was a "curfew" in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Describing the tournament as "a Cinderella event," Tse said it's important for authorities to clean up their act at the Sevens for a better fan experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien expressed concern over whether the government could get the sports park to have a designated spokesperson in time for the Sevens, which will kick off in less than 10 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, Law said the park is actively looking into this and that officials are paying close attention in a bid to minimise the risks of problems popping up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The organisers and government departments will have to work hand in hand. This is no exception. On top of that, this is a new venue. We need enhanced communications," she told the lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sports commissioner, permanent secretaries and I myself are all involved. We have been in close communication with the operator. We want the Rugby Sevens to be a successful event."
  <br>
  <br>
  The sports minister also responded to lawmaker Yang Wing-kit's concern over transportation measures for spectators when events end late or overrun, saying arrangements will be in place to tackle these scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  A catering association had earlier complained that it was unable to host a bar culture festival in Kai Tak during the tournament, saying it didn't have enough time to obtain licences.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said the administration is willing to streamline procedures and offer as much help to different parties as possible when it comes to hosting mega events.
  <br>
  <br>
  She stressed the authorities never received a formal application, and that she personally checked and found that had the association applied, there would have been enough time for a licence to be approved.

    HK men's rugby squad unfazed by pressure at Sevens

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men’s rugby team on Wednesday said they are looking forward to feed off the energy from the home crowd when the Rugby Sevens are held for the first time later this month at Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad is looking to defend their title in the Melrose Claymores competition – a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coach Peter Jericevich says he is confident his players can use last year’s success as fuel to deliver on the SAR's biggest sporting stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, he warned his squad not to let their guard down ahead of their opening match against team China on March 28.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to achieve that last year," Jericevich said. "The key thing now is that first game. That's all we're really thinking about right now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't look too far ahead. Right now, it's about making sure we prepare well this week and how we can ensure we're accurate in the key areas of our game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added home support will provide a major boost to his side's mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I really like about the new stadium is that it feels really close to the pitch. There's a lot of energy that we can definitely use. Sevens is a tough game since you're under fatigue very quickly when you're out there, so the home crowd behind us will hopefully drive us to perform well."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Christie, the captain of the team, said he will draw on the personal experience from the past two editions of the Sevens to lead the young up-and-coming players on the squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can tell them how [the Sevens] was before and how it felt," Christie said after an open training session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all help each other out and talk to each other," he added. "If any of the new guys need anything, we'll be there for them. On the field we hope to just play the way we want to play, and the rest of the team will follow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, who was appointed captain in September, also noted the team will be looking to feed off the home crowd’s energy at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last year we couldn't hear anything because the crowd was super loud," recalled Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You just got to embrace it and enjoy, because it only comes around once a year."

<img alt="Armand Mondo Duplantis makes a run for the pole vault event during the Mondo Classic in Uppsala, Sweden, this month. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796377_1_20250319105616.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Armand 'Mondo' Duplantis headlines a stellar cast in Nanjing for a world indoor athletics championships delayed three times by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nanjing was picked to host the biennial event back in 2020, then in 2021 and then again in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were all moved due to coronavirus rules. In 2022 the event was instead held in Belgrade and in 2023 in Glasgow.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now has the green light and Nanjing's Cube will play host to 576 athletes from 127 countries competing in 26 events over three days of action from Friday to Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That number includes 11 individual defending champions, notably world record holders Duplantis (pole vault), Devynne Charlton and Grant Holloway (60m hurdles), and 20 medallists from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis, Holloway, Hamish Kerr (high jump), Thea Lafond (triple jump) and Miltiadis Tentoglou (long jump) followed up their Glasgow indoor successes with Olympic gold. They will be joined in Nanjing by fellow Olympic gold medallists Yaroslava Mahuchikh (high jump) and Jakob Ingebrigtsen (1500m and 3000m), also world record holders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super excited," Duplantis said. "It was my first time competing in China last outdoor season for the first two Diamond League meets and I jumped extremely well, broke the world record, to 6.24m.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US-born Swede comes into the competition having bettered his world record, for the 11th time, to 6.27m at an indoor meet in the French city of Clermont on March 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Duplantis insisted there would be no recalibration of his season goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No, not really," he said. "It's not the first time I've broken the world record in the indoor season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's according to plan right now, as far as I want."
  <br>
  <br>
  Duplantis said he knew he was capable of "higher heights," insisting that he was "not fixated" by a certain height.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It takes a little bit of time and it's by fairly small increments and it does get a little bit more difficult every time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'd like to get over 6.30m in the near future and then keep pushing it from there. Indoors is a great opportunity always to break the world record because we don't have to deal with the wind and whatnot so we have a lot more controlled variables in that sense."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine's reigning Olympic, world and European outdoor champion Mahuchikh, will compete fresh from winning a third European title in Apeldoorn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahuchikh won her latest accolade with a best of 1.99m before deciding not to go any higher, towards her record mark of 2.10m.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won the gold medal for my country. Of course, I am a little bit disappointed because I wanted to try and jump a bit higher," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope at the next championships I will be in better shape."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norway's Ingebrigtsen completed a distance double in the 1500 and 3,000m at the Apeldoorn Euros.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Competitions and championships are what it is all about," Ingebrigtsen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have always been training towards something and setting goals, with the championship in mind. That is what sport is about. Racing, representing our nation and celebrating the sport."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US team does not feature Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles. Marcellus Moore, Emmanuel Wells and Ronnie Baker instead head the 60m entries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Holloway will bid to become the first hurdler to win three consecutive world indoor titles. Teen prodigy Quincy Wilson is another absentee, the 17-year-old having turned down an invitation and insisting "school comes first!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, who was edged into Olympic silver by Lyles in Paris, is ruled out with an injury. Nishion Ebanks and Rohan Watson will compete in the 60m. (AFP)

    Ohtani leads Dodgers to MLB season-opener win in Tokyo

<img alt="Ohtani shook off the nerves to deliver two crucial hits during the Dodgers' season-opening win. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796342_1_20250319070737.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani admitted he was "nervous" playing in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as the Los Angeles Dodgers started the new Major League Baseball season with a win.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese baseball superstar delivered two important hits as the World Series champion Dodgers beat the Chicago Cubs 4-1 in front of over 40,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Ohtani, a national hero in Japan, said he needed time to feel his way into his first MLB regular-season game in his home country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a while since I've been this nervous playing a game," the 30-year-old said. "It took me a couple of at-bats to get into it but I was glad that I was able to do well in the later part of the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The series has been eagerly anticipated for months in Japan and excitement was at fever pitch at the start of the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said the occasion left its mark on the normally ice-cool Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I've ever seen Shohei nervous, but one thing I did notice was how emotional he got during the Japanese national anthem," Roberts said. "That was telling."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers' Japanese starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto struck out four batters in five innings to come out on top in his duel with Chicago counterpart Shota Imanaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first time two Japanese starting pitchers had ever gone head to head on MLB's opening day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The demeanour he has on the mound, even if he gives up a run he's still calm," Ohtani said of Yamamoto. "He was able to grow into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The action got underway after a Pokemon-themed opening ceremony that featured an appearance by Japanese world champion boxer Naoya Inoue.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani stepped up to the plate to start the game but the first pitch whistled past him for a strike before he grounded out to first base.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cubs had taken a one-run lead by the time Ohtani came back to bat and he again failed to get a hit, lining out to second baseman Jon Berti. (AFP)

    Tennis players' union launch legal blitz against tours

<img alt="The Djokovic-backed players union takes aim at the sport's governing bodies, the ATP and WTA. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796331_1_20250319053811.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tennis union co-founded by Novak Djokovic announced a series of legal actions aimed at the sport's governing bodies, alleging "anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices".
 <br>
  <br>
  The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) said it was suing both tour organisers, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Tennis Federation (ITF), and International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) were also named as defendants in a series of actions in the United States, United Kingdom and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the ATP and WTA responded by vowing to defend themselves against the claims with the men's tour saying the PTPA has "consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA was set up by Djokovic and Canadian Vasek Pospisil in 2020. Some 20 players were named as part of at least one of the actions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lawsuits expose systemic abuse, anti-competitive practices, and a blatant disregard for player welfare that have persisted for decades," said the PTPA statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ATP, WTA, ITF, and ITIA operate as a cartel by implementing a number of draconian, interlocking anti-competitive restraints and abusive practices," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tennis is broken," said Ahmad Nassar, Executive Director of the PTPA.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Behind the glamorous veneer that the defendants promote, players are trapped in an unfair system that exploits their talent, suppresses their earnings, and jeopardises their health and safety."
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement listed alleged abuses they are targeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the defendants "colluded", "fixing prize money and suppressing player earnings" forcing "an unsustainable schedule" and exploiting players financially.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bodies show a "disregard for players" by making them "compete in 100-degree (Fahrenheit) heat, endure matches that ended at 3 am, and play with different and injury-inducing tennis balls".
  <br>
  <br>
  The PTPA also cited image right ownership, sponsorship restrictions and the "draconian system of ranking points".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also complained that tennis violates player "privacy rights".
  <br>
  <br>
  "Players are subjected to invasive searches of personal devices, random middle-of-the-night drug tests, and interrogations without legal representation," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ATP said that it was continuing to make change, with player input and hit back at the union.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the ATP has remained focused on delivering reforms that benefit players at multiple levels, the PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We strongly reject the premise of the PTPA's claims, believe the case to be entirely without merit, and will vigorously defend our position. The ATP remains committed to working in the best interests of the game - towards continued growth, financial stability, and the best possible future for our players, tournaments, and fans," the tour concluded.
  <br>
  <br>
  The WTA also defended their approach to the game and said that PTPA's action "is both regrettable and misguided, and we will defend our position vigorously in due course."
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to Djokovic and Pospisil, the seven-member PTPA executive council also includes players, Hubert Hurkacz, Ons Jabeur, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Taylor Townsend and Zheng Saisai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Nick Kyrgios, France's Varvara Gracheva and American Reilly Opelka have joined the PTPA's case in the United States, while Frenchman Corentin Moutet and Japan's Taro Daniel have joined the case in the United Kingdom. (AFP)

    F1 boss holds talks with Thailand on hosting GP

<img alt="Thailand's Buriram track hosted the season-opening MotoGP races. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796287_1_20250318195022.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Formula One boss Stefano Domenicali held talks with Thailand's prime minister on Tuesday about possible plans to bring a grand prix to the kingdom.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Italian ex-Ferrari boss who has just extended his contract to lead the sport until 2029, is keen to examine new markets as the sport soars in popularity, and Thailand has suggested it may be interested.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most of Formula One's 24-race schedule is locked in for several years, but gaps are set to open up and Domenicali suggested at the weekend that Thailand could be a contender to join the circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the talks, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand would move ahead with a feasibility study to examine the pros and cons of hosting F1 – including the costs and where the race would be run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not just about the honour of hosting the race, but also a significant opportunity to develop urban infrastructure, welcome tourists from around the world to Thailand and develop industry and service sectors," she posted on social media platform X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thailand's northeastern Buriram track has become a regular fixture on the MotoGP circuit, hosting the season-opening race earlier this month, but the kingdom has never hosted Formula 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government spokesman Jirayu Houngsub said the prime minister told Domenicali that Thailand would work with F1 officials to see how a grand prix could work in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Domenicali visited Bangkok in April last year for talks with then-prime minister Srettha Thavisin, who pitched his vision of bringing a race to the sprawling, traffic-clogged Thai capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thai officials said at the time they envisaged a street circuit, possibly around Bangkok's historic centre, as the kingdom looks to boost its image internationally through a host of "soft power" initiatives.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Thailand is not the only country knocking at F1's door – historic hosts France and Germany are seeking a return to the calendar, while the Turkish Grand Prix, last held in 2021, is also seen as a likely candidate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-Pacific region currently hosts four races – in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore – while Thailand is represented on the grid by Alex Albon of Williams, who finished fifth in Melbourne. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China women’s rugby team on Tuesday said they are ready to take their game to the next level at the upcoming Rugby Sevens, to be held at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Team captain Natasha Olson-Thorne was brimming with excitement over playing in front of the home crowd in Kai Tak Stadium, telling RTHK her team is keen to deliver.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team wants to build on their success last year when they were runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition, a tournament among Asian teams which runs alongside the showpiece Sevens event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just got to take it in," Olson-Thorne said during an open training session. "Take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pressure is something that we should enjoy, because we don't often get the chance to perform in front of our home crowd, friends, and family," she added. "So taking that and knowing they're behind us, that's a really important feeling."
  <br>
  <br>
  Olson-Thorne, who made her international Sevens debut during the 2011 Hong Kong Women's Sevens, also said intense training sessions ahead of this year's competition has strengthened the bond between her teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been working on our physicality in the contact area, and also learning to trust ourselves and the team more," she explained. "It's brought us closer together and we're excited to showcase what we've learnt come the Hong Kong Sevens."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chloe Chan, who late last year was selected as the new co-captain of the women's side, said she hopes to encourage her teammates to play to their strengths on the field.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The thing about our team is that we're all so different," said Chan. "We've got speed, we've got physical players, and bigger players who can help us build that foundation in our structure. That's the one thing we know we're good at – using each other's strengths.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added she will do what she can to lead her teammates on and off the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not a very vocal leader, so I don't really like to talk that much. But I like to think I can lead by example, so I'm hoping I can do my job the right way and build each other to do the same thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Head coach Andy Vilk, meanwhile, said he is looking forward to feeding off last year's energy, and said this year's Sevens will be a "unique experience" for his young squad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think last year was a fantastic experience. It's an important experience for the players and their growth and to be able to play with that kind of pressure. We need to understand how we're going to embrace that pressure and use it to our advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vilk – who took up coaching duties just weeks before the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou – said his side will be ready to take on powerhouses Thailand and Kazakhstan in the Melrose Claymores, when the highly-anticipated three-day sporting event kicks off on March 28.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lionel Messi will miss two World Cup qualifiers after he was left out of the Argentina squad for games against Uruguay and Brazil because he reportedly suffered an injury in a club game.
 <br>
  <br>
  After missing three games for his club, Inter Miami, at the start of March with a pulled muscle, the 37-year-old Messi returned with a goal off the bench in a Concacaf Champions Cup win. He played a full 90 minutes and scored again in an MLS win in Atlanta on Sunday but, Argentinian media reported, then felt muscle discomfort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, the defending World Cup champions, can ensure qualification for next year's tournament in their two games on the current international group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They lead the 10-team South American qualifying group by five points from Uruguay and visit Montevideo on Friday before hosting Brazil in Buenos Aires on March 25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams qualify directly for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The seventh-placed team is currently Bolivia with 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  After 12 rounds, Messi is the top scorer in the competition with six goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina are also without injured Roma striker Paulo Dybala and River Plate full-back Paulo Montiel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brazil, will be without 33-year-old Neymar, who has suffered a thigh injury and has had to postpone his return to the national team, who are fifth, seven points behind Argentina. (AFP)

 International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach has announced that boxing is set to be among the sports at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after a new governing body is selected.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bach said the IOC's Executive Board approved including boxing on the 2028 programme after his organisation recognised World Boxing to oversee the sport at the Olympics, ending years of divisions over the way the sport is run.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision still needs to be rubber-stamped by a full IOC Session of about 100 members later this week, but that is expected to be a formality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC stepped in to organise the boxing tournaments at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and the Paris Olympics last year after breaking with the Russian-led International Boxing Association over financial, governance and ethical concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bach had warned that boxing's national federations needed to find a new and "reliable" international partner if it wanted to be included at the 2028 Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, the IOC provisionally recognised World Boxing as the body to oversee the sport at future Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am very confident that the session will approve it so that all the boxers of the world then have certainty that they can participate in the Olympic Games LA 2028 if their national federation is recognised by World Boxing," Bach said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  IOC members will elect Bach's successor on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front-runners in the field of seven candidates are IOC veteran Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe and former Olympic swimmer Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe. (AFP)

    McIlroy wins second Players Championship title

<img alt="The win was McIlroy's second in his career at the annual PGA Tour competiton. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796153_1_20250318053122.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy cruised to a St. Patrick's Day victory at the Players Championship after defeating J.J. Spaun in a playoff at TPC Sawgrass in Florida.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-time major champion completed the three-hole shoot-out in one over par, while Spaun's challenge wilted after a disastrous triple-bogey on the second playoff hole.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the third time I've won on St. Patrick's Day, so it's been a good luck charm for me," McIlroy said after sealing the second Players Championship of his career and 28th PGA Tour title overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was lucky enough to do enough to get it done, but unbelievably proud and happy to win my second Players. It's really nice," McIlroy added. "I went home last night thinking 'I should have had this.' But I went home and reset, didn't have a great night's sleep, but was lucky enough to get it done."
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy had finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with Spaun following Sunday's storm-hit final round after failing to hold on to a three-shot lead with five holes to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after returning to the course on Monday in bright, breezy conditions, there was no sign of a repeat of the late stumble by McIlroy on Sunday that had allowed Spaun to force his way into the first playoff of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy struck first on the opening playoff hole, the par-five 16th, crushing a 336-yard drive straight down the fairway before reaching the green in two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun meanwhile looked out of sorts from the get-go, finding the fairway rough off the tee before landing his second shot into the greenside bunker.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy failed to make his 33-foot eagle putt but calmly rolled in an awkward five-footer for birdie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, whose recovery out of the bunker left him with a long, unsuccessful birdie putt, could only par.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that early wobble, things got worse for Spaun at the par-three 17th island hole, with the American plunging his tee-shot into the water behind the green.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun then missed a long 10-foot putt for double bogey and eventually finished with a triple-bogey six.
  <br>
  <br>
  While McIlroy missed his birdie chance and a 10-footer to save par, his bogey four still left him three shots clear heading to the 18th. McIlroy's tee-shot on the last went well wide of the right fairway, but Spaun was unable to exert pressure, also going wide of the fairway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players reached the green in three and missed their par putts. McIlroy coolly tapped in for bogey to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy's win marked the second title of the season for the Northern Irishman as he build towards the Masters in Augusta next month – the only major missing from his collection.
  <br>
  <br>
  McIlroy said his early season form was a reward for the hard work he has put in over the years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've worked really hard – I feel like I'm a way more complete player than I was a few years ago," McIlroy told NBC. "I feel like I can play in all conditions and anything that comes my way. Really happy that I was able to get it done today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Spaun, meanwhile, was left reflecting on a disappointing outcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's hard not to feel discouraged a little bit, but nothing but positives," Spaun said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Putting myself in contention and giving myself a chance to win in a playoff – if someone had told me that would happen at the start of the week I would totally have taken it," he added. "Hopefully I can just learn from this and get it done next time." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triathletes from the SAR will try to book a spot in this year's National Games by competing in a selection race next month along Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Asia Triathlon Sprint Championships will take place on April 5 and 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race will start with a swim at the Central-Wan Chai Waterfront Promenade, followed by cycling around Lung Wo Road and the IFC, before ending the running portion at Tamar Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the first time the SAR is hosting the Asia Championships and Mixed Relay Championships for adult athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR athlete Jason Ng said he hopes to take advantage of home turf to challenge a strong field of competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the Hong Kong team, as a generalisation, we have raced on this course for a handful of times now in the last of couple years, and I think we are beginning to know it quite well now, so I think just the experience on the course will give us a bit of an advantage," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other local athletes such as Oscar Coggins, Wong Tsz-to and Hilda Choi will be competing against international contenders from 13 Asian countries and regions.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic women's badminton champion An Se-young came from behind to beat China's Wang Zhiyi 13-21, 21-18, 21-18 in a classic All England Open final as top seed Shi Yuqi lifted the men's crown.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Wang won the first game convincingly on Sunday and edged into a 13-10 lead during a captivating second game in Birmingham but the South Korean 2023 champion pegged her back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang scented victory when the scores were tied at 18-18 in the second game but her South Korean opponent took the next three points to level the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decider was also a tight affair but again An, 23, pulled away when the players were level at 18-18, winning her fourth tournament in a row and second at the All England.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had all sorts of emotions going through my mind during the second game," said An. "The thought that was concrete in my mind was not giving up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That thought motivated me to keep playing and I think that led to today's win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't even try to describe how hard today's match was. The match didn't go as I'd planned, which made me extra tired.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I'm pleased with the outcome of the match."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, China's men's world number one Shi delivered a composed performance to see off Lee Chia-hao of Chinese Taipei 21-17, 21-19, also collecting his second All England crown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, ranked 22nd, was quickly out of the blocks and opened up a three-point lead, but Shi reeled off six straight points to lead 9-6 and never relinquished his advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tenacious Lee held a 10-9 lead in the second game but he could not pull away from his 29-year-old opponent, who also won the tournament in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shi was briefly made to sweat after his 20-16 lead narrowed to 20-19 but he held his nerve to seal victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been seven years," said Shi. "A lot has happened during these seven years, ups and downs. I've been to a few semi-finals and didn't make it in the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After these seven years I'm delighted I could win it again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great that I can pass on some positive energy and values to the fans and in return they offer me support and encouragement." (AFP)

    Draper powers past Rune to claim first ATP 1000 title

<img alt="Draper will make his top ten debut at seventh in the world after the victory at Indian Wells. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795988_1_20250317081126.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Britain's Jack Draper roared past Denmark's Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 to win his first ATP Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 14th-ranked Briton, who toppled two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals, didn't face a break point as he subdued the 13th ranked Dane in just 69 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He'll make his top 10 debut on Monday at seventh in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's incredible," said Draper, a US Open semi-finalist last year whose preparations for 2025 were hindered by a flare-up of hip tendinitis. "I'm just so grateful and happy to be out here, to be able to play, my body feeling healthy, to feel great in my mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the work I've done over the last few years, it feels like it's all coming together on the big stage and I can't put that into words," added the 23-year-old, who also missed significant time with a shoulder injury in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper was rock-solid in his first Masters 1000 final, racing to a 4-0 lead as Rune made a nervous start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper dropped just four points on serve in the opening set as Rune, who burst on the scene with a precocious Paris Masters triumph in 2022, had 10 of his 19 unforced errors in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dane had managed to hold serve twice before Draper pocketed the set, giving himself set point with an ace before Rune thumped a backhand into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper broke Rune to open the second set, and even though the Dane got a few more looks at Draper's second serve he couldn't take advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper seized a second break for a 5-2 lead and after sending a forehand long on his first match point he had the win when Rune went long with a backhand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Draper's run to a third career title included victories not only over Alcaraz but also over 2022 Indian Wells winner Taylor Fritz and big-hitting home hope Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty," Draper said. "It's an emotional feeling to know how much you've gone through and put in and to be here now to say that I'm going to be number seven in the world tomorrow, I can't tell you how much that means to me." (AFP)

    Australia's Gout Gout clocks world-leading 200m time

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian sprinting prodigy Gout Gout ran the fastest men's 200m in the world this year, with the 17-year-old saying he felt "literally free".
 <br>
  <br>
  The youngster rose to prominence in December when he clocked the quickest time ever by a 16-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  That mark broke Usain Bolt's personal best at the same age, with his 20.04secs also bettering Peter Norman's Australian record of 20.06 from the 1968 Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  He turned heads again on Sunday with a 20.05 in the heats of the Queensland State Championships – the fastest in the world this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gout then smashed through the 20-second barrier in the final with a 19.98, but it was wind-assisted so deemed illegal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt literally free. I had 80 metres left to go, and I thought, let's send it," he said of the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Only from then did I believe I had a chance of going sub (20)," he added. "Seeing the clock, I was really happy and surprised in a way, but it just felt like a weight off my shoulders. Now that I've done it, I've just got to do that more consistently."
  <br>
  <br>
  The lanky Gout, who was born in Australia after his parents migrated from South Sudan, has drawn comparisons with eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics President Sebastian Coe recently said he was a rare talent but needed "nurturing and protecting".
  <br>
  <br>
  The qualifying mark for this year's World Athletics Championships in Tokyo is 20.16, which Gout has now beaten twice. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paolo Banchero scored 24 points as the Orlando Magic overturned a 13-point deficit to end the Cleveland Cavaliers' 16-game unbeaten streak with a gutsy 108-103 road victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland, the runaway Eastern Conference leaders, had looked poised to extend their franchise-record winning run after surging clear of Orlando early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after a season where they have staged hefty winning comebacks of their own, the tables turned on Cleveland in the face of a furious burst of Orlando scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic outscored Cleveland 35-23 in the third quarter, with Franz Wagner leading the charge with nine points and Banchero adding seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Cleveland led by a slender 83-82 margin heading into the fourth quarter, and threatened to stretch away once more after Donovan Mitchell's driving layup made it 91-84, Orlando refused to roll over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight more points from Wagner in the final frame and five apiece from Banchero and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope saw the Magic home to silence a 19,432 sellout crowd at Cleveland's Rocket Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former number one NBA Draft pick Banchero finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists while Wagner added 22 points with eight rebounds and two assists as Orlando improved to 32-37 to remain eighth in the Eastern Conference standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell led the Cleveland scoring with 23 points, with Jarrett Allen finishing on 20 and Darius Garland adding 19. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva toppled world number one Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to capture her second WTA 1000 title at Indian Wells.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, who last month become the youngest ever player to win an elite 1000 level crown with her triumph in Dubai, ended a frustrating run against the Belarusian to ensure she will rise to a career-high sixth in the world on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva shook off her first set problems and broke Sabalenka three times in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a match of swinging shifts of momentum, Andreeva was in full control by the end, giving herself a match point on Sabalenka's serve with a defensive lob that forced a miss from the number one and clinching victory with a forehand winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank myself for fighting to the end," Andreeva said. "I was running like a rabbit today because Aryna she was sending bullets and it was really hard to keep up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva claimed her first hard court victory over Sabalenka, who had beaten her twice already this year at Brisbane and the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka had powered into the final without dropping a set but it was another disappointment for the Belarusian, who was stunned by Madison Keys in the final at Melbourne to see her bid for a third successive Australian Open title denied.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva had Sabalenka under pressure early, and the youngster's frustration was evident as she was unable to convert four break points in the third game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka took full advantage, breaking the Russian to love for a 3-1 lead and keeping her foot firmly on the accelerator from there.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka backed up her power from the baseline with some confident forays to the net, breaking Andreeva to take the opening set in 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka fought off another three break points to open the second set, but Andreeva finally gained a foothold with a break for 2-1, pouncing on a Sabalenka second serve to end a run of 18 missed break point chances against the Belarusian this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva followed with a quick hold for 3-1 and suddenly it was Sabalenka who looked lost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva saved a pair of break points to push her lead to 4-2, her winners tally climbing with her confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  After missing one chance to take the set on Sabalenka's serve, Andreeva sealed the set with her first love service game, complete with a pair of aces to close it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Russian maintained her momentum as she broke Sabalenka to love to open the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka promptly broke back, but that proved just a speedbump as Andreeva broke again for 2-1 and didn't face another break point on the way to her first career win over a reigning number one. (AFP)

    Newcastle win the League Cup, stunning Liverpool

<img alt="Newcastle United players celebrate after the final whistle. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795975_1_20250317053653.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win," Howe said. "We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled "entertainers" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.
  <br>
  <br>
  All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failures
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to "write your name in the history books".
  <br>
  <br>
  They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn's goal – Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 – capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's challenge for a place in next season's Champions League faltered in a toothless 1-0 defeat at Arsenal, as Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the only goal of a disappointing contest at the Emirates as Arsenal pulled clear in second place and to within 12 points of runaway leaders Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea badly missed the presence of the absent Cole Palmer due to injury as they meekly surrendered to a damaging defeat for their hopes of a top-four finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues remain in fourth for now but have five sides from fifth-placed Manchester City to Aston Villa in ninth within four points of Enzo Maresca's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both managers are hoping to be stronger after the upcoming international break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka is nearing a return for Arsenal, while Maresca is confident of having Palmer, Nico Jackson and Noni Madueke back when they are next in action at home to Tottenham on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did enough to deserve to win the game," said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. "Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal have struggled badly for goals since the loss of Kai Havertz to a season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino into a makeshift centre-forward role.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish international proved the match winner from a corner as he looped a header from Martin Odegaard's delivery inside the far post on 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's Robert Sánchez made a brilliant stop to prevent Merino doubling Arsenal's lead with the best effort of the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the game petered out with little goalmouth action as a limp performance will do little to quieten the critics of Maresca's style of play among the Chelsea support.
  <br>
  <br>
  United extended their unbeaten run in open play to seven games with a comfortable victory at seemingly doomed Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rasmus Hojlund ended a 21-game goal drought by firing United in front on 28 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Garnacho was made to wait for his first goal since November as the Argentine was flagged offside early in the second half. Garnacho, though, was not to be denied with a snap shot that Mads Hermansen should have kept out.
  <br>
  <br>
  United have won all four meetings against Leicester this season, two of which the Foxes' current boss Ruud van Nistelrooy was in interim charge of the Red Devils.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dutchman has not had the same impact at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester have lost 13 of their last 14 league games to fall nine points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van Nistelrooy's men also set an unwanted record of becoming the first Premier League side to go seven home games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bruno Fernandes unsurprisingly set the seal on United's win with a stunning strike from the edge of the box for his seventh goal in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tottenham kept their season alive by reaching the Europa League quarter-finals with victory over AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, but suffered the latest in a series of European hangovers in a 2-0 defeat at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ange Postecoglou's side have won just three times in the 10 league matches that have followed a midweek European fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a difficult campaign for sure," said Spurs captain Son Heung-min. "But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory for Fulham propels Marco Silva's men into the race for Champions League places as they climb to eighth, four points off the top four and three outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five finish will almost certainly secure a place in Europe's top club competition next season thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions. (AFP)

    'National Games test events show room for improvement'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The local official who heads the National Games Coordination Office on Sunday said test runs for cross-border sports events have shown there is room for improvement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is set to co-host the November Games with Guangdong and Macau for the first time, and will host events for eight sports, including fencing and basketball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung Tak-keung told a radio programme that organisers are working to improve cross-border marathon and road cycling events, particularly in supporting athletes who lag behind the leading group.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We found that for some of the arrangements we can make further improvements, like how to support our athletes, and how to monitor [them]," he told reporters after the radio show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the road cycling and marathon [events], sometimes there may be a distance [between] the leading group and the other athletes – they may be not so close together. So how we can provide better support to them, that is one area that we think we can further improve."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Games will also feature 23 mass participation events, including bowling which will be hosted by the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local selections will take place in April and successful candidates can compete with bowlers from other Greater Bay Area cities in the finals in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung added that officials are still working out the pricing for tickets but promised they will be affordable.

<img alt="France's scrum-half Antoine Dupont (centre) holds the trophy while celebrating. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795897_1_20250316063919.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France claimed their seventh Six Nations trophy in a record-strewn 35-16 victory Scotland on Saturday, shaking off their beautiful runners-up tag on a crisp evening at the Stade de France.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus matched England's number of titles since Italy joined the championship in 2000 and did so in style, scoring 30 tries in a pulsating campaign to make sure they would not end up runners-up for the fifth time in six years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their only defeat came against England at Twickenham but Fabien Galthie's side put that 26-25 loss behind them by humiliating Italy before crushing Ireland despite losing their talismanic captain Antoine Dupont through injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts turned on the gas after the interval on Saturday, and prevailed through tries by Yoram Moefana (2), Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Thomas Ramos, who kicked the other points to become came France's all-time record points scorer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland made a game of it and scored a try through Darcy Graham with Finn Russell kicking their other points.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who gave Galthie his second title after the 2022 Six Nations since he took charge in 2020, finished on 21 points with England second.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was party time at the Stade de France but Les Bleus only really got into their groove after the break, relying again on forward power to finish off a combative but limited Scotland team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dupont, who ruptured his ACL against Ireland, stayed with the squad and the mercurial scrumhalf received the loudest cheers as he watched from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  France started well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gael Fickou tore through the middle and set up fellow centre Moefana for a try between the posts while Scotland were down to 14 after Jamie Ritchie was shown a yellow card.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, however, suffered a blow when Peato Mauvaka was sin-binned for head-butting Ben White and the hooker look relieved when he heard the sanction was not upgraded to a red card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos slotted a penalty from under the sticks to beat Frederic Michalak's record of 436 points scored for France and give them a 13-3 lead. He now has 450 to his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors reduced the arrears when Graham touched down after collecting Russell's inside ball. The flyhalf converted and added a penalty to level the scores as French prop Jean-Baptiste Gros was sent off for 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos, however, restored a slim advantage with a penalty on the stroke of halftime before giving away possession with a poor kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scotland's Tom Jordan went over after a superb Blair Kinghorn break but the try was ruled out by the TMO as the fullback was ruled to be in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielle-Biarrey scored a championship record eighth try in a single campaign after being set up by Romain Ntamack who had sprinted through the defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then came the bomb squad as Galthie sent five forwards on from the bench and Scotland cracked.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ramos crossed the whitewash after another devastating rolling maul and Moefana, who bulldozed past Russell after Fickou's offload, claimed the bonus-point try. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shohei Ohtani fever in Tokyo reached boiling point on Saturday as the Japanese baseball superstar hit a home run in his first game in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform in his home country.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani is in the Japanese capital with the World Series champion Dodgers to open the Major League Baseball season with two games against the Chicago Cubs next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old was in action as the Dodgers beat Japan's Yomiuri Giants 5-1 in a warm-up game at the Tokyo Dome, which was packed to its 45,000-capacity rafters.
  <br>
  <br>
  He gave the crowd what they were looking for, smacking a huge home run in the third inning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was great to see so many fans at an exhibition game," Ohtani told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It really made me feel like I was back in Japan for the first time in a while."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Ohtani's first game in Japan since he helped his country win the World Baseball Classic two years ago in Tokyo.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was his first-ever appearance in an MLB uniform in his home country, having left Japan for the Los Angeles Angels in 2018 before joining the Dodgers in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yurie Sakamune, who was at the game with her husband Junji, said the couple had entered 10 times into a lottery to buy tickets and had paid 50,000 yen (US$335) in total after snagging a pair.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's like a dream," said the 30-year-old, dressed in a Dodgers uniform with Ohtani's name and number 17 on the back.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've been working every day to see Ohtani and I've put up with all the tough times for this. It's become like a life goal to see him."
  <br>
  <br>
  A huge cheer went up as Ohtani stepped up to the plate to open the game, drawing a walk from Giants starting pitcher Shosei Togo.
  <br>
  <br>
  He crushed the next pitch he faced, slamming a two-run home run into the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shohei, to be quite honest, in the last seven years has represented almost single-handedly the people of Japan," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for him to come back here in person, it's going to be an emotional night for a lot of people."
  <br>
  <br>
  Excitement has been building for Ohtani's visit, with around 500 fans waiting for the Dodgers to arrive at Tokyo's Haneda airport on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thousands more paid 2,000 yen (US$13) each to watch the team practice the following day, with Ohtani emerging for a brief workout lasting about 10 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slugger, who has been described as a modern-day Babe Ruth, gave fans more for their money against the Giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's really cool," said American Dodgers fan Michael Artukovic, who travelled from his home in San Francisco just to watch the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is going on in our country where we're becoming insular.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great to see this where people from all over the world are coming to a baseball game in another country."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dodgers play another warm-up game against Japan's Hanshin Tigers on Sunday, before starting their two-game series against the Cubs on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vast majority of fans at the Tokyo Dome were wearing Dodgers uniforms, although there was also a smattering of support for the Giants, Japan's most successful team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atsuko Onuma said she was rooting for the Giants but said she had also come to see Ohtani.
  <br>
  <br>
  She confessed she would have "mixed feelings" if he were to hit a home run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to see it but I also want to suppress that feeling," she said. (AFP)

<img alt="Lando Norris says he knows Sunday's race conditions will be completely different to those during Saturday's qualifying. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795861_1_20250315171554.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lando Norris clinched pole position on Saturday for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri as McLaren fired a warning shot to their rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  In scorching hot conditions at Melbourne's Albert Park, world champion Max Verstappen came third in tense qualifying.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mercedes' George Russell will keep Red Bull's four-time world champion company on the second row. Lewis Hamilton will start in eighth on his Ferrari debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the perfect way to start the year. A big congrats to the team, everyone has done an amazing job to start with a one-two," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it is just quali, right? Let's see tomorrow," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The car is extremely quick. When you put it together it is unbelievable, but it is hard to put it together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm never going to get ahead of myself, I'm confident the car is in a good place but we have never run it in the wet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The forecast for Sunday's race is for cooler temperatures and rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris eclipsed his rivals with a flying lap of one minute 15.096 seconds on soft tyres, 0.084sec ahead of Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy, great to start the year on the front row," said Piastri.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Pretty happy with how qualifying went, but just not quite enough in Q3, but it is a long season so a good start," added the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe left a little bit on the table."
  <br>
  <br>
  No Australian driver has won their home race since Alan Jones in 1980, but that was a non-championship race before Australia was added to the F1 calendar in 1985.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen, who was the pole-sitter in 2023 and 2024, was three-tenths behind Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen is chasing a second win in Australia after his 2023 victory to kickstart his bid for a fifth consecutive world title, a feat only Michael Schumacher has achieved.
  <br>
  <br>
  RB's Yuki Tsunoda will start a surprise fifth alongside the Williams of Alex Albon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Hamilton were a disappointing seventh and eighth with Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz in the other Williams filling out the top 10. (AFP)

    'Rugby Sevens tourists opting for HK Island hotels'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, one of the city's most popular and highly anticipated events, will be hosted at a brand new location this year, but the retail and tourism sectors are still expecting a boost in spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event kicks off on March 28 and will be staged at the newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park - after three decades of being held at the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told a Commercial Radio programme on Saturday that many tourists coming for the tournament have opted for hotels on Hong Kong Island despite the change in venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that it will take time for visitors to adjust to the new location.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because they used to live in areas like Causeway Bay and they are used to the area, so they would continue to stay there," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They also know that transportation is convenient on Hong Kong island side, so maybe during the first year, they will adopt a wait-and-see approach."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yiu was also pleased to see that around 80 percent of the three-day tickets have been sold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow lawmaker Peter Shiu from the retail sector believes Lan Kwai Fong in Central will remain a hotspot for revellers, on top of the new attractions in Kai Tak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said the so-called "Hong Kong Super March", which features a series of world-class events such as LIV Golf, and the Coldplay concert next month, will attract long-haul visitors to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the sector still lacks manpower, particularly coach drivers, he added.

    Sabalenka books Indian Wells title clash with Andreeva

<img alt="Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka shakes hands with USA's Madison Keys after winning their semi-final match at the Indian Wells Tennis. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795836_1_20250315123114.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aryna Sabalenka avenged her Australian Open loss to Madison Keys on Friday, thrashing the American 6-0, 6-1 to book an Indian Wells title showdown with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva.
 <br>
  <br>
  Red-hot Russian 17-year-old Andreeva showed plenty of poise in a 7-6 (7/1), 1-6, 6-3 victory over defending champion Iga Swiatek, ending the second-ranked Pole's bid to become the first woman to win three titles in the California desert.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hungry," said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge after Keys denied her bid for a third straight Australian Open title in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused, I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was riding a 16-match winning streak, couldn't get a foot in the door.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think tactically I played really great tennis," said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to "just keep her out of the rhythm".
  <br>
  <br>
  The mis-firing Keys finally held serve for 5-1 in the second, but minutes later Sabalenka sealed the win and lined up a shot at the WTA tour's newest sensation Andreeva in what 26-year-old Sabalenka quipped would be "kind of like an old mama playing against a kid".
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva beat Swiatek for the second time in as many tournaments, having stunned the Polish star in the quarter-finals at Dubai last month on the way to becoming the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek, who hadn't dropped a set in winning 10 straight Indian Wells matches, looked supremely confident as she dropped just one point in her first three service games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was Andreeva who claimed the first break of the tense first set for a 5-4 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva stepped up her attack and broke Swiatek to open the third, and she sealed the win with her third break of the set. (AFP)

    Rashford recalled in Tuchel's first England squad

<img alt="Marcus Rashford has looked more like his old self since his loan move to Aston Villa. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795783_1_20250314215113.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel said Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson are contenders for England's 2026 World Cup squad after earning recalls in his first squad on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn were handed their maiden call-ups for Tuchel's first matches in charge in World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia.
  <br>
  <br>
  England have turned to the former Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain coach in a bid to win a first major tournament since 1966 after losing the last two European Championship finals under Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford last played for the Three Lions a year ago but has been revitalised since a January loan move to Aston Villa from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Henderson, 34, made the last of his 81 appearances for England back in November 2023 as moves to Saudi Arabia and then Ajax saw the former Liverpool captain fall down the pecking order for Southgate and interim boss Lee Carsley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone who's with us on this journey in the first camp is a contender for the World Cup," Tuchel said at a press conference at Wembley.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Jordan, I think this is a pretty easy one," he added. "What he brings to every team is his leadership, his character, personality, energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He makes sure that everyone lives by the standards and with this characteristic he embodies everything we try to build as a team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford had been an outcast at United under Ruben Amorim, but has looked more like his old self in helping Villa to reach the quarter-finals of both the Champions League and FA Cup with four assists in nine appearances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said he wanted to "bond" with the 27-year-old and encourage Rashford not to fall back into bad habits with his work rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I felt that Marcus had a huge impact in Aston Villa since he changed," said Tuchel, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His hard work in counter pressing, his tracking back on his position was impressive and I had the strong feeling that we should nominate him, we should bring him in, to push him to stay on that level. To not fall back in old routines."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis-Skelly was expected to be included after excelling in his breakout season for the Gunners at 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn is at the other end of his career, but is rewarded for his consistency with a first call up at 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel is the third non-British coach of England after Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German's appointment stirred controversy among some England fans given their long-standing rivalry with Tuchel's homeland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Prince William, now an English Football Association patron after 18 years as the organisation's president, believes Tuchel's pedigree makes him well suited for the job.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without doubt he is one of the top five managers in the world. It would be amazing if he could win the World Cup next year. It's gearing up to that and it's definitely possible," William told The Sun on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel said it was an "honour" to have met William during his first few months in charge and is keen to prove the decision to appoint him was the correct one by the Football Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Exciting and a bit surreal," he said of becoming the first German to lead England. "It's a big honour and I'm very proud of it. I'm very well aware of it, I will make sure that I earn my rights to be in this place." (AFP)
