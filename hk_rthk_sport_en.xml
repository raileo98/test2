<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic faced a series of obstacles in the Miami Open final: a delay of more than five-and-a-half hours before the match, an eye infection and a slippery court due to high levels of humidity following the rain.
 <br>
  <br>
  But the largest roadblock was the youth and power of 6-foot-4, 19-year-old phenom Jakub Mensik, who outdueled the 37-year-old Serbian in two tiebreakers 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) to win his first ATP title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 54th entering the tournament, the Czech Republic teenager plowed through Djokovic with poise and a stellar 130 mph serve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He collected 14 aces and got broken only once.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik bashed a service winner on match point and fell on his back.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You’re the one I idolized when I was young,″ Mensik said to Djokovic during the ceremony after the match that lasted two hours and three minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I started playing tennis because of you.″
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik’s victory spoiled the party for Djokovic, who was seeking his 100th career title and a record seventh in the Miami Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will have to wait, while the teenager looks ready to join the elite.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is a joyous moment for him and his family – an unbelievable tournament, first of many,″ Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It hurts me to admit it, you were better. In the clutch moments you delivered the goods. For a young player like yourself, this is a great feature.″
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd pulled hard for Djokovic, who hadn’t played here since 2019.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than three-quarters of the fans stuck around despite the massive delay, chanting “No-vak!’’ and singing his name across critical parts of the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, far from a fan favorite here earlier in his career, saluted the fans, saying it was one of the warmest crowds he’s had ever.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the men’s leader with 24 Grand Slam titles seemed compromised by his eye issue, with redness seen under the eyelid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic applied eyedrops during two changeovers in the first set. It was unclear if it affected his vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the set, he also slipped twice on the court.
  <br>
  <br>
  The humidity reached 90 percent after hours of rain disrupted the card.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweating profusely, Djokovic asked the umpire for a bucket of sawdust to sprinkle on his wet grip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik had lost to Djokovic in a three-setter in October at the Shanghai Masters but the youngster said before the match he had played too nervously.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik was playing his first ATP 1000 final.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was not quite two years old when Djokovic won his first Miami Open title in 2007.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was more fearlessness this time than in Shanghai.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik got up 3-0 with an early break but Djokovic broke back at 4-3, then held for 4-4 after fans chanted his name.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik held for a 6-5 lead in a game that saw Djokovic take a tumble in the doubles alley chasing a drop shot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik served it out with his seventh ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first-set tiebreak, Mensik charged ahead 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mensik executed a leaping backhand volley winner and Djokovic muffed a routine forehand drop shot into the net to fall behind 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  On set point, Mensik slugged an overhead smash for a winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was scheduled for 3am Hong Kong time but the players didn’t take the court until almost six hours later due to rain and organisers deciding on completing the women’s doubles final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South Florida rain began during the women’s doubles final pitting Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider against Cristina Bucsa and Miyu Kato, with Andreeva and Shnaider leading 3-0 in the first set.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women’s players returned to the court later after the rain stopped and the courts were readied by court-drying machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  But rain began minutes later before warmups and the umbrella-toting players left the court again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women returned to the court an hour later and resumed play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva and Schnaider went the distance, prevailing in a third-set match tiebreaker 6-3, 6-7 (5), 10-2. (AP)

<img alt="Pistons forward Ronald Holland drives towards the basket as Timberwolves center Naz Reid defends during the second quarter at Target Center in Minnesota. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798214_1_20250331103953.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Seven players and members of coaching staff were ejected after a wild brawl broke out during the Minnesota Timberwolves' 123-104 victory over the Detroit Pistons in the NBA.
 <br>
  <br>
  A testy duel between the two sides at the Target Center in Minneapolis erupted into chaos early in the second quarter when Minnesota's Naz Reid took exception to being bumped by Detroit's Ron Holland as he drove towards the basket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reid jabbed a finger angrily at Holland as the two players squared up after the incident.
  <br>
  <br>
  It escalated rapidly, with players from both sides being sucked into the melee that spilled into the spectator seats at courtside.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves' Donte DiVincenzo was in the thick of the uproar and tumbled backwards into the seating as a scrum of players and team officials grappled around him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protracted scrap lasted around a minute before tempers cooled and the officiating crew began to determine who was at fault.
  <br>
  <br>
  When it was over, the Timberwolves' Reid and DiVincenzo – who could be seen with what looked like large scratch marks near his neck – were tossed along with the Pistons' Marcus Sasser, Isaiah Stewart and Holland.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit Pistons head coach J B Bickerstaff was also ejected while Minnesota's assistant coach Pablo Prigioni was also tossed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minnesota head coach Chris Finch later suggested Detroit's overly physical approach early in the game had triggered the flashpoint.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked for his view of the incident, Finch replied: "Two guys went at it, and then spilled over into the crowd which was super dangerous.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then obviously it just kept escalating, and escalating, mostly from their side to be honest with you.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought leading up to that the game was way too physical.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a little lopsided in its physicality and I thought it was bound to happen. It just felt like it was coming.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew they were a super physical team. They hit you, they hold you...but I just thought it got to a point where players were going to take matters into their own hands, and you don't ever want that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit coach Bickerstaff, meanwhile, accused Prigioni of triggering the incident that saw them both ejected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was things said by their assistant coach," Bickerstaff said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I'm in the same boat as my guys are in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to defend each other and I'm not going to let people say belligerent things about my guys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And it's that simple. So he said what he said. He knows what he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Again, I didn't think it crossed the line to escalation of anything, but in that moment, I understand, you know, the refs' position."
  <br>
  <br>
  US media reported meanwhile that a young fan sitting at courtside who had been caught in the chaotic scrum was later presented with a Minnesota team jersey by Alex Rodriguez, the former Major League Baseball star who is now a part owner of the Timberwolves. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Marcus Rashford's first goals for Aston Villa inspired a 3-0 win against Preston that sent his side into the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 10 years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rashford struck twice in the second half at Deepdale to end Preston's stubborn resistance before Jacob Ramsey wrapped up Villa's long-awaited return to the last four.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa will face Crystal Palace, 3-0 winners at Fulham on Saturday, in the semi-finals at Wembley on the weekend of April 26 to 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revitalised since joining Villa on loan from Manchester United during the January transfer window, Rashford is beginning to show the form that made him one of England's brightest stars prior to his steep decline over the last two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid concerns over his attitude and off-field behaviour, Rashford was deemed expendable by United manager Ruben Amorim, after also clashing with former Old Trafford boss Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old hadn't scored since netting for United against Everton on December 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deployed in the central striker's role that often seemed to dent his confidence at United, Rashford was too dynamic for second-tier Preston to handle in the latest sign that his career might not be destined to end in disappointment after all.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's always nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues," Rashford said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I missed a lot of football before joining up with Villa. It's step by step. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now," he added. "We're very ambitious. We'll see where it takes us."
  <br>
  <br>
  While struggling United have been mired in turmoil, Rashford has benefited from moving to upwardly mobile Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester City came from behind to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for a record seventh consecutive season with a 2-1 win over Bournemouth, but victory came at a cost as Erling Haaland hobbled off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haaland had seen a first-half penalty saved before Evanilson put the Cherries in front.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian made amends by equalising four minutes into the second period before being forced off with an ankle injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  His replacement, Omar Marmoush, took just two minutes to score the winner from a second assist by the impressive Nico O'Reilly as City booked a semi-final clash against Nottingham Forest.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seven times in a row reaching semi-finals in the FA Cup – this is outstanding. This generation of players, they have done this," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have been a shadow of the side that won four consecutive Premier League titles this season and Guardiola said prior to the game that even FA Cup glory would not save a miserable season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' collapse in the Premier League began at Bournemouth back in November with a 2-1 defeat that kicked off a run of six defeats in eight games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guardiola hailed the difference in attitude in his side between then and now.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We came here in November with the flip flops on against a team that if you don't compete, it is impossible," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In football you have to run," he added. "People say about my teams 'how good they play' but no, it is how much we run, how much we fight and for many games this season it didn't happen." (AFP)

    Mitchell magic as Cavs down Clippers to bag 60th win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Donovan Mitchell led from the front as the Cleveland Cavaliers bagged their 60th win of the NBA season with a 127-122 victory over the in-form Los Angeles Clippers.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland talisman Mitchell finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in what Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson later described as his best performance of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunday's victory means Cleveland have reached 60 wins in a season for the first time since the 2009-2010 campaign, and for only the third time in franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  More significantly, the win leaves Cleveland four-and-a-half games clear of NBA champions Boston in the race for the number one seeding in the Eastern Conference playoffs with just seven regular season fixtures remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland coach Atkinson said reaching 60 wins was beyond his expectations at the start of the campaign following a 48-victory season in 2023-2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect 60 wins," Atkinson said. "My internal goal was 'Can we improve from last year?' That was kind of where my mind was. But for this team to take it to another level and kind of shatter that says a lot. And we're not done – we can still add to that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we've got to celebrate this," he continued. "It's not the end goal, but we should take a deep breath and celebrate 60 wins. It's so hard to do in this league. I'm really happy for the guys today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell received offensive support from Jarrett Allen with 25 points, while Evan Mobley added 22 and Darius Garland 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Atkinson reserved special praise for Mitchell, who was immense at both ends of the court for Cleveland, with four steals in addition to his points tally.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's at that kind of maturity and mental level where he can manipulate the game how he wants it," Atkinson said of the 28-year-old six-time NBA All-Star.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would argue that this was probably his best all around game all year," he added. "He did everything tonight and showed great leadership."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat left the Clippers in eighth position in the Western Conference, where they are locked in a ferocious dog-fight with Golden State and Minnesota for an automatic ticket into the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers are on 42-32 – the same record as the seventh-placed Timberwolves – with the Warriors sixth on 42-31 heading into the final two weeks of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in the Western Conference advance to the playoffs while teams ranked from seventh to 10th play a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff slots. (AFP)

    Bagnaia wins USA MotoGP after Márquez crash

<img alt="Francesco Bagnaia of Italy rides during the 2025 Grand Prix of the Americas at Circuit of The Americas. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798175_1_20250331060812.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Francesco Bagnaia won an eventful Grand Prix of the Americas to end crash-victim Marc Márquez's perfect start to the MotoGP season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Six-time elite class champion Márquez was set fair to make it six wins out of six in Texas after romping to victories in the sprints and main races in Thailand, Argentina and Saturday's sprint in Austin.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a crash on lap nine did it for the Spanish superstar, gifting victory to his Ducati factory teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alex Márquez, on a Ducati satellite bike, took second for the sixth time to move one point clear of his older brother in the riders' standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fabio Di Giannantonio, on another Ducati satellite machine, came in third at the Circuit of the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia supplied Ducati with their 20th consecutive grand prix success, just two shy of Honda's historic benchmark of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was chaos before lights out with riders on the grid, their bikes equipped with wet tyres, all set for the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  But then, with the changeable overcast conditions drying, pole-sitter Marc Márquez dramatically ran back to the pits to swop to a bike with slicks, triggering a domino effect as his grid rivals copied his example.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he had not sat on his bike Márquez did not break any rules, only causing mayhem, and a delayed start with a race reduced by one lap to 19 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was one last twist to the pre-race drama, when Maverick Vinales, last year's winner, had to wheel his bike off the grid with an issue to start from the pits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez got away to a flyer when they were eventually let go to lead from Alex Márquez with Bagnaia up from sixth to third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Márquez senior quickly stamped his authority on the race with more than a one second cushion over the chasing pack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bagnaia moved up to second after eight laps, albeit over two seconds behind the rider who lists the Circuit of the Americas (COTA) as one of his favourite tracks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then the race was turned on its head when Márquez crashed on lap nine, slithering off his bike after touching a kerb.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejoined in 18th place with 10 laps remaining, only to call it a day a couple of laps later.
  <br>
  <br>
  One frustrated bystander at COTA was world champion Jorge Martin who has missed the opening three rounds after breaking his right hand and foot in pre-season testing crash in Malaysia.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has delayed his title defence and his debut for Aprilia. He moved to the team after being overlooked by Ducati for the factory ride that was offered to Márquez.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robert Lewandowski bagged a brace as Barcelona eased to a 4-1 victory over Girona to move three points clear at the top of La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  After second-placed Real Madrid pulled level on points with them on Saturday by beating Leganes, Hansi Flick's side restored their advantage at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewandowski responded to Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe's double with one of his own to stay three goals ahead in the race for Spain's golden boot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona, unbeaten this year in 20 matches, took the lead through a Ladislav Krejci own goal near the end of the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arnaut Danjuma pulled Girona level but Lewandowski netted twice and Ferran Torres finished off the rout.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game," veteran striker Lewandowski said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old said he had the legs to keep playing for seasons to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know a lot of people are talking abut my age but I want to play more years at the top level," said the Poland international. "I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago."
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona beat Barcelona twice last season but have struggled to hit those heights again and sit 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They were superior," admitted Girona coach Michel Sanchez. "There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth. Barcelona dream of titles every year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick rotated some of his usual suspects with the Copa del Rey semi-final clash against Atletico Madrid in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were below their free-flowing best in the first half despite dominating, occasionally threatening through the dynamic running of teenage star Lamine Yamal and frantic energy of Fermin Lopez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona wanted a penalty when Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla on the edge of the box and a free-kick was given.
  <br>
  <br>
  A VAR review showed the contact was inside the area but the referee decided Lopez fouled Asprilla as they came together, much to Barcelona's chagrin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paulo Gazzaniga produced a sensational save with his fingertips to push out a Ronald Araujo header but Barca found a way through before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal's dangerous free-kick aimed at Eric Garcia was deflected into his own net by Krejci at the near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Girona had produced very little of note in the first half but were back level eight minutes into the second through Danjuma.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daley Blind played the Dutch striker through and he beat Wojciech Szczesny with a clinical low finish. However, Barcelona were swiftly back in front as La Liga's top goalscorer Lewandowski notched his 24th of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lopez nodded the ball across the six-yard box and Lewandowski contorted his body to reach it and flick it between Gazzaniga's legs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The forward secured Barcelona's victory with his 25th, slotting home after substitute Frenkie de Jong pushed forward into space and fed him.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was time for Torres to add a fourth after Gerard Martin found him and for the brilliant Yamal to bend a strike against the crossbar.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was remarkably the 20th time this season Flick's side have scored four goals or more from 45 games, with a potential treble in their sights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that," Flick told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, fourth-place Athletic Bilbao were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Osasuna, allowing Villarreal to cut the gap on them to six points after beating Getafe 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Betis, sixth, won their sixth game in a row to stay on Villarreal's tail, beating rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby clash.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valencia's 1-0 win over Mallorca took them 15th, four points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina on Sunday captured the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens for the first time, defeating France in a hard-fought men's final at the Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Neither team managed to break through in a defensive-minded first half, which finished 0-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the second half, tries from Santiago Alvarez and Marcos Moneta in quick succession, and an ensuing conversion, put Argentina up 12-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gregoire Arfeuil of France scored a last-minute try but it was too little, too late.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 12-7 win gave Argentina their third straight title in the World Series, having also come out on top in Perth and Vancouver.
  <br>
  <br>
  They extended their lead atop the standings to 12 points ahead of Fiji on 88 points entering the Singapore Sevens next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee presented the winning trophy to Argentina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alvarez, playing for his country for the 14th season, said it wasn't just about winning but also the connections he has built with his teammates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Difficult to describe what we're feeling, what we did [as] a team," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The connection we have, really, really happy and proud of this team. I will always say thank you to this team because for me, it's all I have in my life."
  <br>
  <br>
  While there was a bigger contingent of French fans at the Kai Tak Stadium, their team were unable to repeat the magic when they put away two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Zealand women's team had better luck, defeating archrivals Australia in the final 26-19 for their third straight crown in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides went back and forth for much of the game, before Jorja Miller scored two tries for the Black Ferns in the second half to open up a 14-point margin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's Mackenzie Davis scored late to add to two tries from teammate Maddison Levi, but their efforts came up short.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means everything... this puts us in a good place for the world series title as well so, I'm really stoked about it," New Zealand captain Sarah Hirini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Black Ferns now have 96 points in the World Series standings, eight more than Australia ahead of the trip to Singapore for the final stop on the Sevens calendar.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong, China Rugby Association, James Farndon, on Sunday hailed the first-ever Sevens at the Kai Tak Stadium, calling the event a massive success for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br>
  Farndon stressed the importance of the upgraded fan experience at the new venue, following nearly half a century at the Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an amazing experience for all involved," Farndon told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main point I'd make is what the experience is like for the fans -- and from what I see, it's obviously a bigger house, bigger party. The fan experience has been fantastic."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also spoke about the popularity of the stadium's South Stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The South Stand's been rocking, and the entertainment has been fantastic too," he added. "If you look at the other aspects of the stadium we've been able to add in... it's just a lot more for the fans to experience, and I think they really enjoyed it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Farndon also highlighted the work to bring the showpiece tournament to Kai Tak, having gone through multiple stress tests in the run-up to the three-day sporting event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a real journey for us, but a real positive one," Farndon explained. "We've had test events at various stages, which have been able to give experience to our event operations team -- to learn the back of house and how [the Sevens] is going to work for the players, coaches and the international teams coming in."
  <br>
  <br>
  Brett Robinson, the chairman of World Rugby, also spoke highly about new Kai Tak experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For those of us who had the chance to be around [the stadium], and also from an athlete's perspective, it's purpose-built for the game of Sevens," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got women that are singing songs, and athletes that are just really enjoying the experience and really feeling quite valued."

 Both the SAR men's and women's teams won an invitational in style at the first Hong Kong Sevens at Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local squads drew some of the loudest cheers from an electric home crowd, as the men's team successfully defended their Melrose Claymore title.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the final against the national team, Hong Kong, China conceded a try in the first half but quickly bounced back, racing to a 14-5 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR scored three more tries against China after the break to come away 35-5 winners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Max Denmark scored one of those second-half tries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just saw the ball in front of me and the try line's so close, so all I can think of was I've got to get over there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scoring at home, in this stadium, hearing the crowd is the best feeling on the planet."
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's team took advantage of a Kazakhstan player being sent off in the first half to score a 45-5 victory in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne scored a try for the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When you're going through, there's a moment when you break through and you're like, am I in the clear? And you're like, yes, yes I am. And I could hear (teammate) Chong Ka-yan behind me going, you've got this, keep going," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's good to have that confidence from the team, to know that they back you, it's quite special."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR co-captain Chloe Chan hailed the win, calling it a total team effort, adding that they now turn their focus to the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China women's squad improved from their runners-up finish a year ago.

 Rugby lovers from Hong Kong and beyond filled up the Kai Tak Stadium on Sunday to enjoy a final day of sport and partying at the Hong Kong Sevens.
 <br>
  <br>
  Now in its new home, the annual rugby showcase isn't just about the action on the pitch. The food and drinks, the raucous atmosphere and the people are also what attracted fans to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brian Hopkins, who supports Great Britain, said the Sevens is the perfect occasion to celebrate his 40th birthday.

   "There's no better place to do it. It's a great atmosphere, great rugby, great stadium as well," he told RTHK. "We tried the food, we tried plenty of drinks... It's going to be a keg of Guinness against my name."
   <br>
   <br>
   For Donna Hopkins, the stadium was friendly to wheelchair users.
   <br>
   <br>
   "Down and around here, I could get to the food, the toilets were really accessible. I could see the pitch really well," she said.

    Brett Muntz, who grew up in Fiji and now lives in New Zealand, stuck to his roots and supports the Flying Fijians.
    <br>
    <br>
    "It's all about the people, connecting and enjoying a magnificent occasion and this magnificent venue," he said. "Everyone seems to come for the right reason - have a good time, meet people, enjoy, and leave the results on the field and celebrate together."

     Epeli Buliciri, also a Fiji fan, was adding this year's Hong Kong Sevens to his impressive resume.
     <br>
     <br>
     "This is my 122nd tournament. It's my 17th Hong Kong Sevens tournament," he said.
     <br>
     <br>
     "Hong Kong is always special for Fiji. Even sometimes when life gets down and all that, you can always rely on the Hong Kong Sevens and the Fiji team to get you back up there."
     <br>
     <br>
     His hat with a glistening pin collection was not the only one competing for attention at the stadium.

<div class="itemFullText">
 France's emphatic run at the Hong Kong Sevens continued on Sunday as they scored a dramatic, nail-biting victory over Fiji to book a place in the final where they will battle Argentina.
 <br>
  <br>
  The French had knocked out two-time defending champions New Zealand in the quarterfinals the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar to that game, France fell behind against Fiji, but they quickly bounced back to take a 10-7 halftime lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides then went back-and-forth before the final play that went in favour of France.
  <br>
  <br>
  The referee called for video review over Matteo Garcia's try, eventually ruling it was successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  France won 24-17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina booked the other berth in the final by defeating Australia 31-7, thanks in part to a hat-trick of tries from German Schulz.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither France nor Argentina have won the title before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, New Zealand's quest for a third consecutive title is very much alive as they crushed Canada 41-0 in the semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  They'll meet rivals Australia in the title showdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jazmin Felix-Hotham scored two tries as New Zealand put the game out of reach in the first half, leading 26-0 at intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the other semis, Maddison Levi's hat-trick helped Australia to a 28-5 victory over France.

    Sabalenka beats Pegula to take Miami Open

<img alt="The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798090_1_20250330101920.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka powered her way to the Miami Open title on Saturday, beating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event at Hard Rock Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The title was the Belarusian's first at Miami and her second of the season following her January triumph in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having lost the final at Indian Wells to Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva earlier this month, Sabalenka was determined not to fall at the last hurdle again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final," said Sabalenka, who paid tribute to Pegula's performance after repeating her win over her from last year's US Open final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players struggled to hold their serve in the first set, which saw seven breaks of serve, with Pegula causing Sabalenka some trouble when she brought her up to the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the momentum shifted when Pegula was serving to stay in the set at 6-5 down and Sabalenka turned it on, producing a delicate forehand drop and then a superb down the line winner to take the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once she recovered from being broken on her first service game of the second set, it was easier going for Sabalenka, whose bid for a third straight Australian Open title was thwarted in the Melbourne final by Madison Keys earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka broke twice to go 3-1 up and never looked in danger from that point on as she wrapped up the win in one hour 27 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  In her last 14 matches against top 10 players, Sabalenka has won 12 and she credited her ability in the clutch moments for her record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the third time that Pegula has faced Sabalenka in a final and she has lost on all three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best," Pegula conceded after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her," she added
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pegula, the world number four, said she was pleased to again have been a serious contender in a tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 26-year-old Sabalenka has now won eight WTA 1000 titles and 19 titles on the WTA Tour overall - 17 of which have come on hard courts including all three of her Grand Slam singles titles -- the 2023 Australian Open, the 2024 Australian Open and the 2024 US Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  She looks a calmer, more focused, presence on court than in her earlier seasons when she was capable of bouts of rage when the going got tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka said that her struggles in the past with her serve had allowed her to develop a stronger all-round game and more positive mentality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's final on Sunday will feature Novak Djokovic up against Czech 19-year-old Jakub Mensik with the Serb looking for his 100th professional title. (AFP)

<img alt="The Toon Army had waited 70 years to see their beloved team lift a domestic trophy. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798039_1_20250329194334.jpg&q=70">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ending a 70-year wait for a domestic trophy deserves an official party.
 <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle will get one on Saturday when the team holds an open-top bus parade to celebrate their English League Cup title.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 150,000 fans are expected to join the celebration. The parade route runs from St James’ Park, through the city centre and ends at the Town Moor, an open space where a stage has been erected for an hour-long event that will include comments from players and a trophy lift.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi-backed team beat Liverpool 2-1 nearly two weeks ago at Wembley Stadium for their first major domestic trophy since the FA Cup in 1955. The club also won the now-defunct Inter-Cities Fairs Cup – a European competition – in 1969.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bus was scheduled to set off from the stadium at 4:30 pm local time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has been nominated for a municipal honour called the "Freedom of the City." Club legends who have received the recognition include Alan Shearer, Bobby Robson and Shaka Hislop. (AP)

<img alt="Tim Hardaway Jr connected on seven of 11 from three-point range for Detroit. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798019_1_20250329151714.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tim Hardaway Jr scored 32 points to lead Detroit to a 133-122 victory over the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, a triumph that assured the Pistons of their first winning NBA season since 2016.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hardaway connected on seven of 11 from three-point range on the way to his season-high, leading seven Pistons players to score in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  That included Ausar Thompson with 18 points and 10 rebounds and Dennis Schroder with 17 points and 10 assists as Detroit improved to 42-32 – tripling their win total from last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had to do it without Cade Cunningham, who missed a third straight game with a bruised calf, and Tobias Harris, who was a late scratch with Achilles tendon trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pistons withstood a 38-point performance from Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell, who helped the Cavs erase a 21-point deficit to close within two with 3:31 to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit responded with a 12-1 run to seal the win, which most importantly pushed their lead for fifth place in the East to one and a half games over the Milwaukee Bucks, who fell 116-107 to the New York Knicks.
  <br>
  <br>
  OG Anunoby scored 20 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter for the Knicks, who handed the Bucks a third straight defeat despite 30 points, nine rebounds and seven assists from Giannis Antetokounmpo – who returned after missing one game with a foot sprain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Golden State superstar Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his return from a two-game absence with a pelvic contusion, lifting the Warriors to a 111-95 victory over the Pelicans in New Orleans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors got off to a sluggish start against the struggling Pelicans, who were without Zion Williamson and CJ McCollum.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Curry scored 13 points in the second quarter to help the Warriors keep it close despite woeful shooting from three-point range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he thought Curry "looked great" and his team as a whole looked better as the game went on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't love the passing in the first half, but we took care of the ball better in the second half," Kerr said. "All in all a positive outcome, a positive effort on a night where we're clearly trying to get our rhythm back as a group."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors picked things up on both ends of the floor in the second half. Jimmy Butler added 18 points and 10 rebounds for Golden State, who remained seventh in the West and battling to avoid the play-in tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers remained in sixth – the final spot for direct entry to the playoffs – after a 132-100 victory over the Nets in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Clippers and Warriors have the same 42-31 record, the Clippers holding the head-to-head record tiebreaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves are just half a game back in eighth after a 124-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard scored 31 points to lead the Clippers, connecting on five of six three-point attempts and 10 of 14 overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added six rebounds, four steals and a pair of blocks, and Ivica Zubac added 21 points on perfect nine-for-nine shooting as the Clippers notched their 10th win in their last 12 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Denver Nuggets, fuelled by 27 points and 14 rebounds from NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, cruised past the Utah Jazz 129-93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver led from start to finish, Jokic and the rest of their starters sitting out the fourth quarter of the rout. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men’s and women’s squads for the SAR on Saturday kept their winning streak alive on day two of the Hong Kong Sevens, which also saw an end to New Zealand's campaign to win a third-straight title.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong China men’s squad beat Japan 43-21 in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team’s captain, James Christie – who came up big in the second half – said team effort played a big role in their victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You know it’s all about scoring tries and we all got people who could finish them off, you know, but it’s nice to come on on the end of a nice team try, and that’s what makes us good,” Christie told RTHK after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also described the atmosphere at the new stadium, which has a retractable roof, as “crazy”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “With the roof open, it’s still as loud, so it’s pretty crazy, especially some of [the people] at the South Stand [who have been here] since 8am I think…Thank you all for coming out, means the world to us.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the SAR women’s squad easily saw off their Thai opponents 47-0, with the crowd “absolutely pumping from start to finish," Pete Laverick, RTHK's sports correspondent who watched the match at Kai Tak Stadium, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both squads have secured a spot in the Melrose tournament’s finals which will be held on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the main Sevens tournament, there has been a major upset in the men's Cup quarterfinals, where France beat defending champions New Zealand by 21-14, denying the Kiwis' attempt to win a third consecutive title in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  France – who had trailed New Zealand by 14 points before coming from behind to take the win – will now take on Fiji, with Australia facing Argentina in the semifinals on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  And on the women's side, it will be Canada versus New Zealand, while Australia take on France in Sunday's semifinals.

<div class="itemFullText">
 There were winning starts for the Hong Kong, China men's and women's squads on Friday as the Rugby Sevens got underway to much fanfare at the Kai Tak Sports Park.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's representatives - who are looking to defend their Melrose Claymores title - cruised to a 31-7 victory over the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We're] feeling pretty good, we went down early there, so we [had] good composure, good fightback to score some good tries out there," men's captain James Christie told RTHK after the win, who also credited the support of home fans at the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to be here to witness it. It's nothing like I've seen before. Obviously [the fans are] the eighth man on the pitch, so it really helps us, inspires us."
  <br>
  <br>
  They will look to keep their winning momentum going when they take on Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's side, meanwhile, held on for a 29-14 win over Kazakhstan in the opener. They will next face Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Co-captain Chloe Chan was confident that the squad can clinch the top prize, having finished as runners-up last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We trained hard in and out every day," Chan said. "Once we're on there, it's all the same stuff – if we all do our job well, then we'll be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  The two matches were separated by an official opening ceremony featuring a dragon and lion dance, a performance by cheerleaders of South Korean baseball team Kia Tigers, and a laser show on the pitch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Irish rugby legend Brian O'Driscoll and former Hong Kong winger Salom Yiu also made an appearance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outside the Melrose Claymores, 12 teams in the men's - and another 12 for the women's - fought to reach the knockout round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the New Zealand men's and women's are aiming to defend their Hong Kong Sevens titles for a third successive year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The women's squad, who are 12-time champions in the SAR, began the day with a 45-0 demolition of the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a really good game, and I thought we played pretty well," captain Sarah Hirini said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We] did some pretty cool things out there, and obviously very stoked to get a win like that against China who are a very quality team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kiwis men's, meanwhile, also took care of business by beating Australia 21-12 in the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina, which fielded only a men's team, are also emerging as favourites. They were dominant on Friday, with big wins over Ireland and the United States.

<img alt="Jessica Pegula has a word with Alexandra Eala after squeezing through to the finals. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797850_2_20250328133508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Philippines sensation Alexandra Eala's remarkable run at the Miami Open came to a brave end with a three-set loss to Jessica Pegula in the semi-finals on Friday Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an enthralling and exhausting battle over two hours and 24 minutes, fourth-seeded American Pegula emerged with a 7-6 (7/3) 5-7 6-3 win to seal a place in Saturday's final against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old Eala, ranked 140th in the world, had only two WTA main draw victories to her name before arriving in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  She proceeded to beat three Grand Slam winners in Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and world number two Iga Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lowest-ranked semi-finalist in the tournament's history, Eala seriously threatened to go one step further with another accomplished and effervescent display.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tide looked to have turned against her when Pegula broke to go 3-1 up in the second set, but Eala broke back and her fist pump and look of determination was a sign of things to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke Pegula three times in the set and was broken twice herself but crucially was able to hold when serving for the set at 6-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both players protected their serve better in the deciding set but Eala's forehand let her down when the American broke to go 5-3 up and she served out for a victory that brought her visible relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka blasted her way into the final with a convincing 6-2 6-2 demolition of Italy's Jasmine Paolini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka needed just 71 minutes to wrap up her win against the sixth seed and with the win the Belarusian, who was beaten in the Indian Wells final earlier this month by Mirra Andreeva, will appear in the Miami final for the first time in her career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy with the level I played today. Of course super happy to be in my first Miami Open final," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was never behind against Paolini and the match was only tied twice – at 1-1 in each set.
  <br>
  <br>
  She served six aces and broke the Italian's serve four times,
  <br>
  <br>
  "I definitely would say that this was one of the best matches in the season so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know. I was just so focused on myself, on the things I had to do today.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt like everything was just going smoothly my way," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka will be keen to banish the memory of defeat in the Indian Wells final and in the Australian Open final, where she lost to Keys.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The lessons [of those defeats] was I believe focus on myself, not on what's going on the other side," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think in those finals I was more focusing on my opponents than on myself.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I just have to bring the same attitude, the same mindset that I had today, I think I have to bring it in the finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really feel this time I'm going to do better than I did in the last two finals," added the 26-year-old.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is only the sixth woman to reach the finals of both stops on the American "Sunshine Swing" in the same season. (AFP)

<img alt="Late triples from Coby White (L) and Josh Giddey helped the Bulls to a win over the Lakers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797835_1_20250328123014.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Giddey buried a miracle shot from beyond halfcourt at the final buzzer as the Chicago Bulls overturned an 18-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 119-117.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Bulls (33-40) trailed 115-110 with 12.6 seconds remaining before delivering down the stretch with a wild sequence of plays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Williams hit a 3-pointer to trim the deficit back to two points before Giddey, who moments earlier had airballed a floater, stole LeBron James' inbound pass, flicked the pass to White, who drained a trey to put Chicago in front 116-115 with 6.1 seconds to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers retrieved the lead on an Austin Reaves layup with 3.3 seconds on the clock, before the Bulls, who had no timeouts left, struck at the buzzer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey passed the inbound to Williams, who gave it straight back and the Australian nailed the game-winning 47-foot prayer over James.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giddey finished with 25 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for his fifth triple-double of the season, while Coby White scored 26 points and Kevin Huerter added 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves scored 30 points for the Lakers, and Luka Doncic had 25 points, 10 boards and eight assists. Jaxson Hayes contributed 19 points, and James paired 17 points with 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers' lead had ballooned to 91-75 on the back of a commanding 32-17 third period in which they dominated the Bulls at both ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers set a club record by scoring 162 points in their 53-point win over the Washington wizards, who also gave up the most points in their franchise history.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers scored five more than the previous record set last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton led the way with 29 points for the Pacers, becoming one of nine players who scored in double figures. (Reuters)

<img alt="Carlos Rodon's pitching was key to the Yankees' win to open the new season. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797817_1_20250328105734.jpg&q=90">
<img alt="Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers were also winners to start the new campaign. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797817_2_20250328105734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Rodon pitched effectively into the sixth inning and was backed by two early homers as the host New York Yankees hung on for a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the season opener for both teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Austin Wells hit a leadoff homer three pitches into the home half of the first inning and Anthony Volpe connected in the second as the Yankees improved to 7-1 in season openers under manager Aaron Boone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aaron Judge added an RBI double in the seventh and Cody Bellinger followed that at-bat with a sacrifice fly in his Yankees debut. Those runs proved crucial when New York's new closer, Devin Williams, struggled in the ninth against his former team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the third season of a six-year, $162 million deal, Rodon (1-0) allowed one run on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out seven and walked two in his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Milwaukee's Freddy Peralta (0-1) allowed two runs on four hits in five innings during his second career Opening Day start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eleswhere, Shohei Ohtani, Teoscar Hernandez and Tommy Edman hit home runs, Blake Snell went five strong innings and the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers capped a day of celebration with a 5-4 victory over the visiting Detroit Tigers.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his Dodgers debut, the free-agent addition Snell (1-0) gave up two runs on five hits over five innings with two strikeouts. The two-time Cy Young Award winner was able to work around four walks. Blake Treinen pitched a scoreless ninth for his first save.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ohtani hit his second home run in the third game of the season as the Dodgers played at home for the first time since a victory in Game 2 of the 2024 World Series against the New York Yankees.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Houston, Framber Valdez tossed seven shutout innings and the new-look Astros claimed a 3-1 victory over the visiting New York Mets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Valdez (1-0) became the first left-hander in franchise history to make four consecutive Opening Day starts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scattered four hits, issued two walks and recorded four strikeouts, seemingly strengthening as he worked deeper into his outing. Valdez tossed 90 pitches, 56 for strikes. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic turned on the style to take his place in the last four of the Miami Open with an impressive 6-3, 7-6 win over American Sebastian Korda, becoming the oldest man to reach a Masters 1000 semi-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old Serb made a strong start against Korda, breaking early to get a first set advantage that he never let slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Korda showed great resilience in the second set, taking the contest to a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the fourth-seed Djokovic, looking for his seventh Miami Open title but first since 2016, again came up strong, sealing the win with a powerful ace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, who will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on Friday, had no doubt what had been the key to his success, after winning 84 per cent of his first-serve points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One word, serve. I was serving very well, probably the best serving performance, not just here, but in a long time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Czech teenager Jakub Mensik marched into his first Masters semi when he defeated France's Arthur Fils 7-6, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils had enjoyed one of the biggest wins of his career on Wednesday when he defeated top-seed Alexander Zverev, but he struggled to repeat the feat against the impressive 19-year-old Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Czech will next face American third seed Taylor Fritz, who came through an enthralling battle with Italian Matteo Berrettini with a 7-5, 6-7, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini looked buried in the second set tie-break when he trailed 6-3 but his booming serve and some incredible returns gave him the opportunity of a deciding set. In total, Berrettini saved six match points in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was nip and tuck with the pair on serve until Fritz, working hard on the baseline, broke to go 6-5 up and then held on for the win. (AFP)

    New NBA All-Star Game format was 'a miss', says Silver

<img alt="The NBA said the four-team mini-tournament for this year's All-Star Game will be scrapped. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797807_1_20250328094751.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It's unclear what next year's NBA All-Star Game will look like, but commissioner Adam Silver said the league is "a bit back to the drawing board" as it moves away from the three-game mini-tournament that was implemented this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday following a board of governors meeting, Silver said the league will look for ways to improve the mid-season event, which this year drew 4.7 million viewers across TNT platforms - down 13 percent from last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The only NBA All-Star Game with fewer viewers came in 2023, with 4.6 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought we made almost an immeasurable amount of progress," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought this was a little better, but it was a miss. We're not there in terms of creating an All-Star experience that we can be proud of, that our players can be proud of."
  <br>
  <br>
  This season's format featured four teams competing in a three-game mini-tournament, with 24 All-Stars divided among three teams in San Francisco.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fourth team was the Rising Stars event winner, which was held two nights before the All-Star Game. Four-time NBA MVP LeBron James, a late scratch, was not among the participants. Anthony Edwards also scratched.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We recalibrated around this year's All-Star game in San Francisco, around more of an entertainment product, and I don't think it worked," Silver said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The breaks were too long. And I get it: It was an opportunity to celebrate TNT, as they were gonna have their last All-Star Game. It was well-intentioned."
  <br>
  <br>
  Next year's All-Star Game will be broadcast on NBC, which takes over following a 23-year run by TNT.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commissioner added that despite the success of the NHL's Four Nations Face-Off, the NBA doesn't appear to be set on adding a USA vs. World format for next year's All-Star Game in Inglewood, California, which will be the new home of the Los Angeles Clippers. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s men’s basketball team have made history by qualifying for the FIBA 3x3 Asia Cup for the first time ever, while their teammates from the women’s team representing Hong Kong, China fell just short of doing the same.
 <br>
  <br>
  The men’s squad of Chan Wing-hei, Lam Chun-tat, Tsoi Lung-tak and Wong Ho-yin fought their way into the tournament by topping their qualifying group.
  <br>
  <br>
  They beat Bahrain, Guam and Malaysia in the process, and a one-point loss to Indonesia didn’t stop them from becoming one of twelve teams making the group stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the first time the SAR progressed to the main draw in eight tries, since the competition made its debut 12 years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The team will play hosts Singapore on Saturday afternoon and Mongolia at night, as they look to advance further in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China's women's team would've also qualified for the Cup for the first time - but they dropped the final do-or-die game against Chinese Taipei, 17-19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona swept to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Osasuna to move three points clear at the top of La Liga despite their discontent at having to play their match on Thursday local time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' appeal against the rescheduling of this game was rejected but Hansi Flick's side, unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions, still made light work of Osasuna, 14th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo netted in the first half with Robert Lewandowski on target after the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca were without key winger Raphinha as he played for Brazil on Wednesday in South America in World Cup qualifying but cruised at the Olympic stadium regardless.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match was originally due to be played on March 8 but it was postponed after a Barcelona club doctor died.
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick put veteran striker Lewandowski on the bench, deploying Torres in his place to excellent effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona controlled the game from the start, taking the lead through Torres after 11 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Osasuna goalkeeper Sergio Herrera then brought down Olmo to concede a penalty for Barcelona's second midway through the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herrera saved Olmo's spot kick, but a re-take was ordered after an Osasuna player encroached, and this time the playmaker made no mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  The second half was a low key affair as Barcelona were content with their lead, until Lewandowski came on for Torres, hungry to get in on the action.
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran Polish striker nodded home from Fermin Lopez's cross at the end of a quick break to extend Barca's lead and his own at the top of Spain's scoring charts with 23 league goals. (AFP)

    LeBron snaps Lakers' three-game slump with late tip-in

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James tipped in a buzzer-beating rebound with 0.1 seconds remaining as the Los Angeles Lakers halted their three-game losing streak with a pulsating 120-119 road victory over the Indiana Pacers.
 <br>
  <br>
  A thrilling duel in Indianapolis saw the Pacers climb out of a 13-point fourth-quarter hole to snatch a 119-118 lead with 42 seconds remaining, and leave the Lakers staring down the barrel of a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with the clock ticking down, Luka Doncic made one last drive to the basket -- only to see his attempted 13-foot floater bounce off the rim.
  <br>
  <br>
  James reacted fastest, leaping to palm the ball into the bucket for the winning score and give the Lakers a precious victory in the race for Western Conference playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 40-year-old James -- who had failed to score from the field in the opening three quarters -- finished with 13 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lakers coach J.J. Redick saluted the veteran superstar's perseverance in dragging his team over the line despite having an offensive off-night.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's another great example of where he doesn't necessarily have it going early, and got off to a slow start offensively," Redick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he was so good defensively for us. And then he takes over in the fourth quarter and gets rewarded by the basketball gods because he didn't let go of the rope and didn't stop competing."
  <br>
  <br>
  James said he hadn't been bothered by his low-key offensive performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whatever it takes to help your teammates win," James said. "For me, I can always do other things that still impact the game, even when I'm not scoring."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic led the Lakers scoring with 34 points, seven rebounds and seven assists while Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura had 24 and 14 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win leaves the Lakers in fourth place in the west on 44-28. The top six finishers in the standings automatically qualify for the NBA playoffs. (AFP)

    Fils outplays top seed Zverev in Miami Open upset

<img alt="Alexander Zverev returns a shot against Arthur Fils in their fourth-round match at the Hard Rock Stadium. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797645_1_20250327114411.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 France's Arthur Fils upset top-seed Alexander Zverev with an outstanding display earning him a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over the German in the fourth round of the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old Frenchman will face 19-year-old Czech Jakub Mensik in the quarter-finals with both players chasing their first Masters 1000 semi-final spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rallying from a set down on Wednesday, Fils showed great determination to fight his way back and go 4-1 up in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev responded to take a 3-1 lead early in the third but again Fils refused to let the match slip from his grasp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils, using his athleticism and his powerful forehand, broke back to 3-2 and then when Zverev went long on a return took a 4-3 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev held when serving to stay in the game at 5-4 down but Fils kept his composure to serve out for one of the biggest wins of his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory was all the more impressive given that Fils later revealed he was suffering from back pain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was feeling not great in the rallies. I've had a little problem in my back since I was young, so sometimes it hurts me a little bit," explained Fils.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had to find a rhythm, [be] more aggressive and come into the court to play my game and not let him play, because when you let him play he is one of the best tennis players in the world. I'm really happy about the way I did it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fils had also reached the quarter-finals at Indian Wells this month and he becomes the first Frenchman to make the last eight in both legs of the "Sunshine Double" since Gael Monfils in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the opening quarter-final, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov battled back from a set down to beat Argentine Francisco Cerundolo 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3) in a riveting duel.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Cerundolo edged the first, the 33-year-old Dimitrov found his rhythm and was relentless in forcing Cerundolo to work on the baseline for every point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo was 6-5 up in the third set and had one match point but Dimitrov showed his grit again and was able to hold and force the contest to a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimitrov raced out to a 3-0 lead and never looked in danger as he ran out the winner to book his place in the semi-finals where he will face the winner of Wednesday's later match between Novak Djokovic and American Sebastian Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  An exhausted Dimitrov needed medical attention at the conclusion of the match, skipping the on-court interview. (AFP)

    Teenage Filipino Eala stuns Swiatek at Miami Open

<img alt="Alexandra Eala is the first player from the Philippines to reach the semi-finals of a WTP 1000 tournament. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797607_1_20250327071056.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alexandra Eala, a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal," she said on court.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage," said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala will next face American Jessica Pegula, who outplayed Britain's Emma Raducanu 6-4 6-7 6-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just because I won this match or the one before doesn't make the next one any less tough. If anything it will be more tough, so it will take everything that I have," said Eala.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiatek will look forward to moving on to the clay season after conceding that she had been far from her usual level.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure I wasn't playing my best game and I felt like my forehand collapsed a little, so it wasn't comfortable and Alexandra, for sure, used her chances and pushed me, so for sure she deserves to win this match," she said. (AFP)

    Coleman Wong ready to climb up world tennis rankings

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's tennis star, Coleman Wong, said late Wednesday that he was more confident about cracking the top 100 in the men's singles world rankings, following his historic success at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  He became the first player representing Hong Kong, China to make the third round of an ATP Masters 1000 tournament, beating World No. 14 Ben Shelton in the second round before losing to Adam Walton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182 in the world, said he was glad to prove the doubters wrong with his play - and that it's possible for someone from the SAR to beat a top-20 player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to very much thank everyone in Hong Kong for their support. You all motivated me a lot. Especially the doubters - they always seem to say, oh you're not good enough. There isn't a tennis player from the SAR who is able to shine on the world stage, and beat a top 20 player," he told reporters at the airport after returning to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I want to tell everyone that it's possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old has been training at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he's very grateful that the tennis legend had called him to offer his congratulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was super. He found my agent asking for my number, and he called me on his own number. Nadal texted me his congratulations. He says he hopes I can keep going as he thought I gained a lot for Hong Kong," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He called me a world-class player."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he now plans to play at the Barcelona and Madrid opens, saying his coaching team think he's ready for more action on the clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also explained that he drank some coke during matches because he was a bit tired and he wasn't into coffee, so the coaching staff said he could down the soft drink for some caffeine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said he felt physically drained while playing in the third round as he wasn't used to the grind at major competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that's an area he would look to make improvements on.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The winner of this year's expanded Club World Cup in the United States will receive up to US$125 million in prize money, Fifa announced on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A total prize fund of US$1 billion for the event, which runs from June 14 to July 13, had already been made public, but Fifa has now broken down the sums for the 32 participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each team will share in the US$525 million pot for participating, while a further US$475 million will be distributed according to performance in the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  With additional bonuses, the team that emerges victorious from the seven matches played could receive up to US$125 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Europe will receive the lion's share of the prize money, with each of their clubs receiving between US$12.81 million and US$38.19 million, the exact amounts to be determined according to sporting and commercial criteria.
  <br>
  <br>
  South American teams will each receive US$15.21 million in participation bonuses, while those from North and Central America, the Caribbean, Asia and Africa will receive US$9.55 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Auckland City, the Oceania representative, will take home US$3.58 million for taking part.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The distribution model... represents the biggest prize money ever awarded to a competition comprising a group stage and a knockout phase," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino in a press release.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition to the prize money earmarked for the participating clubs, an unprecedented solidarity programme will be put in place with the aim of redistributing an additional US$250 million to football around the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino said all proceeds from the event will be redistributed to club football. (AFP)

<img alt="The Melrose Claymores, a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens, will be back this weekend. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797526_4_20250326175525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The men’s and women’s squad from New Zealand are chasing their third straight Hong Kong Sevens title this weekend when they battle it out at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated rugby tournament will take place for the first time at the new venue from March 28 to 30, having moved away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New Zealand men’s squad kicks off their campaign on Friday, facing off Australia in their first pool match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We managed to win the last one in the old stadium. We're trying to create history again and win the first one in the new stadium," men’s squad captain Dylan Collier said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It should be awesome. Looking around it at the moment, it looks unbelievable. The pitch looks good as well, so it's going to be an awesome tournament coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the women’s side, captain Sarah Hirini highlighted the importance of balancing fierce competition and camaraderie.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was seen handing out friendship bracelets to fellow captains during a photo shoot in the stadium on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We love it. We love what Hong Kong's all about. It's a party atmosphere. It's the home of Sevens, and we can't wait to get amongst it this weekend. Hopefully the South Stand will be rocking for us," Hirini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone's pretty competitive at the moment in the way teams are going, and improving over the series has been really awesome for our game. We hope that we do well, but we hope that the games itself are exciting as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hirini's squad opens their tournament against China, which will be joining the main event this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national women's team won the Melrose Claymores – a tournament featuring Asian teams that runs alongside the Sevens – last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the SAR squads say they are also looking forward to feeding off the home crowd's energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China team co-captain, Natasha Olson-Thorne, said her squad always gets an extra boost while playing at home, and they look to build on their success from last year when they were the runners-up in the Melrose Claymores competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great playing in front of a home crowd. They always got your back, so I think one of the special feelings to be running out of that tunnel and hearing the cheers from the crowds, and that's definitely motivational," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not pressure, it's just we want to embrace the pressure and play and have a good time."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the men’s side, Hong Kong, China will be looking to defend their Claymores title after last year’s triumph over Japan.

  <br>
  "There's always pressure being the winners from last year. I think some of us are used to it, but some of us are new in the team. So we help each other out and then just have to figure it out on the pitch together," captain James Christie said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The NBA is to review a proposal to create a European basketball league, a spokesperson has confirmed, after a report detailed a new competition that could feature up to 10 teams.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sports business news website Sportico said on Tuesday that league owners will consider a plan that includes eight to 10 franchises, including up to four teams who already play in the EuroLeague – Europe's top club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed league would also feature new franchises in cities such as London and Paris, which could be worth as much as US$500 million, Sportico reported, citing a source with direct knowledge of the plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  An NBA spokesperson said the league would consider the issue of a European league this week, noting that any new competition would be launched "in partnership" with FIBA, world basketball's governing body.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At this week's NBA board of governors' meeting, the league will report on its exploration of a new men's basketball league in Europe, in partnership with FIBA," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rumours of the NBA taking a bigger role in European basketball have swirled for several months, with deputy commissioner Mark Tatum saying in October there was an "untapped opportunity" to grow the sport in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no doubt that I think there is an opportunity for the game of basketball to continue to grow in Europe," Tatum said on a conference call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And, you know, what we're focused on is really working with FIBA and our partners in Europe to tap into this untapped opportunity to further grow the game of basketball there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tatum noted that despite basketball's popularity in Europe, the sport had "less than a one percent share of the commercial market."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So we just think there's an opportunity to have a better model for European basketball," Tatum said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sportico reported that while no formal vote on the European league proposal had been scheduled during this week's meetings in New York, team owners could nevertheless vote on the plan "at any time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sportico reported that under the proposal being considered, the NBA would sell permanent franchise slots to outside investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, private capital, wealthy individuals or existing European basketball clubs. (AFP)

    'All systems go at Kai Tak for rugby showcase'

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797464_1_20250326133017.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Kai Tak Sports Park said it's ready to host the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We are fine-tuning our arrangements, and we learn from our past experiences. We adjust our operations and enhance communication with various parties and maintain continuous improvement,” Tang King-shing, a Kai Tak Sports Park director, told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are confident that we are ready for the Rugby Sevens.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The venue experienced mishaps earlier. In one incident, fans at the World Snooker Grand Prix were told to leave while a match was still in progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rugby Sevens will take place from Friday to Sunday at the new Kai Tak Stadium, having moved from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Security checks will be conducted outside the venue, with spectators asked not to bring long umbrellas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also said they have retained the iconic South Stand – a ground for rugby fans donning elaborate outfits – which will have a “complete upgrade” in its new home.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We are very pleased to see our fans in fancy dress enjoying themselves in the South Stand,” said Hong Kong China Rugby executive director Bryan Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They have a good idea of what is appropriate and what is not. We have a list of prohibited items… We encourage all of our fans to follow that list, to ensure that they’re not bringing in any props that won’t be allowed into the stadium.“
  <br>
  <br>
  A fan village outside the stadium will hold various activities such as live stage performances, and all matches will be shown live on a big screen.
  <br>
  <br>
  But organisers said the opening hours at the village will be shorter than previously announced “to make egress as smooth as possible”.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There’s still plenty of time for people to enjoy themselves. We don’t view this as a negative, this is a positive response,” said Rennie.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said about 43,000 tickets have been snapped up, and is optimistic that the three-day event would be sold out.

    Son homes in on pitches for S Korea's World Cup slips

<img alt="Son Heung-min reacts at the end of the match with Jordan that saw South Korea draw again. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797449_1_20250326114106.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Son Heung-min blamed South Korea's shoddy pitches for their 2026 World Cup qualifying struggles after a 1-1 draw with Jordan left them sweating on an automatic place at the tournament.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Koreans were held at home for a second game in a row on Tuesday after also drawing with Oman last week and hold a precarious lead at the top of Asian qualifying Group B with an away trip to third-placed Iraq still to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's two qualifiers in March were moved away from Seoul because of the capital stadium's poor pitch but skipper Son said the turf was still below par and took aim at his country's football administrators.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we're at home we're supposed to enjoy the best playing conditions possible but things have not improved at all," the Tottenham striker told reporters after the game in Suwon.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know we can play better than this but when conditions on our home soil get in the way, then I wonder where we should get our home advantage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Poor pitches have been a running theme in South Korean football, with former Manchester United and England forward Jesse Lingard also weighing in last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lingard, who now plays for FC Seoul in the K League, tripped over a chunk of turf while playing at home for his club and later took to social media to air his frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's World Cup qualifier against Iraq in October last year was also moved away from the capital because of the playing conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know this may sound like an excuse, but every small detail matters in football," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It can make the difference of getting one point or getting three points. I hope people will pay closer attention to it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee Jae-sung gave South Korea the lead in the fifth minute before Jordan equalised later in the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves the Koreans on top of Group B with 16 points, three ahead of Jordan and four ahead of Iraq, who suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Palestine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top two qualify automatically for the World Cup in 2026 in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea play Iraq away in their next game before rounding off their campaign at home to Kuwait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite this disappointment we're still leading the group and that's a fact," said Son.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to stay there until the end of the round."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Indonesia head coach Patrick Kluivert said it was "just the beginning" after his Indonesia side beat Bahrain 1-0 in front of nearly 70,000 in Jakarta to breathe new life into their World Cup qualifying hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five days after Barcelona and Dutch great Kluivert saw his team thrashed 5-1 by Australia in his first game as coach, Oxford United's Ole Romeny scored the only goal in the 24th minute for a vital three points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan top Asian qualifying Group C and have already punched their ticket to North America in 2026, with Australia in distant second in the other automatic qualifying place on 13 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  With two rounds of matches to go, Saudi Arabia are third on 10 points, one point ahead of Indonesia in fourth, with Bahrain and China on six points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing third and fourth go into another round of qualifying – Indonesia's most likely route to their first World Cup since gaining independence as a country in 1945. (AFP)

    Sabalenka sets up Paolini semis with win over Zheng

<img alt="Aryna Sabalenka has a word with Zheng Qinwen after their Miami Open match at the Hard Rock Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797443_1_20250326112222.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World number one Aryna Sabalenka battled back in the second set to blast her way into the semi-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 7-5 win over China's Zheng Qinwen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory  on Tuesday gives Sabalenka her first place in the last four at Miami, with a clash against Italy's Jasmine Paolini standing between her and a place in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  It looked like it was going to be routine business for the Belarussian against the ninth-seed Zheng when Sabalenka took the first set comfortably.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng had worked something out between sets and came out firing, breaking Sabalenka twice to open up a 4-2 lead in the set.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka was in real trouble at 0-40 down but, after some signs of anger, was able to fight back to hold for 4-4 and then turned her aggression into a powerful finale.
  <br>
  <br>
  With some blistering returns, the top-seed broke to go 6-5 and then with her serve at full force, confidently held to secure the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us," said Sabalenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Paolini moved into the semi-finals with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, beaten in the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to make it to the last four in Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  It took just 77 minutes for Paolini to take care of business against Linette who had progressed into the quarters with a surprise win over Coco Gauff.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lengthy delay to the start of the game, caused by heavy rain in the afternoon, didn't cause any issues for the sixth-seeded Paolini who dominated from the off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolini, who is looking for her second title at the WTA 1000 level, after last year's triumph in Dubai, looked confident and said she had known her form would start to bring her results.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there – maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's two quarters see second-seed Iga Swiatek up against Alexandra Eala, the wild-card teenager from the Philippines, who has already beaten Australian Open champion Madison Keys.
  <br>

<img alt="Novak Djokovic breezed past Italy's Lorenzo Musetti to book his spot in the next round in Miami. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797434_1_20250326101120.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic cruised into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Italian Lorenzo Musetti in one hour 22 minutes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musetti, the 15th seed from Tuscany, got off to a flying start to take a 2-0 lead in the first set but then proceeded to lose the next nine games as the Serb, looking confident and sharp, ran away with the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic has won the Miami Open on six occasions but has not featured in the quarters since his last victory here in 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old is now just three wins away from winning his 100th tour-level title.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He had a really good start of the match. First couple games I started a little bit slow and then I knew that if I give him time, he's going to make his shots," Djokovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He loves kind of running around his backhand, hitting forehands. But he is so talented, he can play any shot in the game on any surface," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, particularly in the first seven, eight games of the match. But I think breaking his serve to come back to two-all and break right away at 3-2, it was a momentum shift and I tried to use that," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic will face American Sebastian Korda on Wednesday for a place in the semi-finals after the 24th seed beat French veteran Gael Monfils 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in a rain-affected match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda visibly struggled with his wrist, however, and said after the match that he had been in discomfort with an injury that has caused him trouble in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's pretty painful right now, we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Will do a lot of work with my physio now, we'll see how it is tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I haven't played a lot of tournaments this year. Hopefully I can play some good tennis and see where it takes me," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Korda later pulled out of his doubles match with partner Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo upset fifth-seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 6-2 to take his place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo, who enjoys plenty of support from South Florida's large Argentine community, has now reached the last eight in three of his past four appearances at Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cerundolo failed to make the most of three break points in the opening game but eventually broke through at 3-3, converting his fourth break point of that game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23rd seed, who lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals at Indian Wells, was dominant in the second set, but his victory was postponed by a three-hour, 30-minute rain delay that arrived when he was 5-1 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy. It's always difficult when you're playing a really good match, controlling the game, and you have to stop for rain," said Cerundolo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not easy, but I was chill and came back to the match confident and played a really good service game. I'm super happy to get back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals in the US, on hard courts. It's a great achievement," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next up for Cerundolo is 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated American Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-5.
  <br>
  <br>
  A day after a thrilling three-set win over Brazilian Joao Fonseca, Australia's Alex de Minaur was eliminated by tenth-seed Italian Matteo Berrettini who triumphed 6-3, 7-6 (9-7).
  <br>
  <br>
  Berrettini had the chance to close out the match when serving at 6-5 but let three match points slip and the match went into a tie-break.
  <br>
  <br>
  De Minaur then had a great chance to force a deciding set when he was 6-3 up but was unable to convert the three set points and Berrettini was able to claw back victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italian will face third-seed Taylor Fritz who progressed with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Australia lucky loser Adam Walton. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentina celebrated their 2026 World Cup qualification with a dazzling 4-1 thrashing of arch-rivals Brazil in Buenos Aires.
 <br>
  <br>
  Julian Alvarez, Enzo Fernandez, Alexis Mac Allister and Giuliano Simeone sealed an emphatic win on Tuesday for the world champions, who had been assured of their World Cup berth after Bolivia's 0-0 draw with Uruguay earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  That goalless stalemate ensured a festive atmosphere at the Estadio Monumental before a ball had been kicked and Argentina kept the party going with a blistering performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atletico Madrid forward Alvarez opened the scoring after just six minutes, latching onto Thiago Almada's through ball and dinking a close-range finish past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  It got better for Argentina six minutes later when Chelsea's Fernandez tucked away the hosts' second goal of the night after Brazil's back four failed to deal with a low cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Brazil being run ragged by a rampant Argentina, they were thrown a lifeline on 26 minutes after a blunder by Cristian Romero gifted a goal to Mattheus Cunha.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Romero was caught in possession 25 yards from goal, allowing Cunha to steal in and drive a low shot past Emiliano Martinez to make it 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  But any hopes of a Brazilian fightback were snuffed out in the 37th minute with a superb goal from Mac Allister.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almada was once again the creator, lofting a pass into the area which Mac Allister met with a first-time volley to make it 3-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Argentina in complete control, Simeone then brought the house down with a 71st minute strike to make it 4-1 – his first international goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone, the 22-year-old son of Argentine legend Diego Simeone, somehow blasted into the roof of the net from an acute angle to crown a dominant performance by the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means Argentina have qualified for next year's finals in the United States, Mexico and Canada with four games to spare.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentines lead the 10-team qualifying group with 31 points from 14 games and are guaranteed one of the six automatic qualifying slots awarded to South America. Brazil are fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other South American games, Ecuador stayed on course for qualification with a 0-0 draw against Chile in Santiago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ecuador are second in the standings, eight points adrift of Argentina on 23 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uruguay's draw with Bolivia – and Brazil's heavy loss – allowed them to move up to third place on goal difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Colombia meanwhile missed the chance to close the gap on the leaders after a 2-2 home draw with Paraguay in Barranquilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Luis Diaz and Jhon Duran fired Colombia into a 2-0 lead after just 13 minutes but Paraguay grabbed a share of the points with goals from Junior Alonso and Julio Enciso.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela boosted their hopes of a first-ever World Cup qualification with a 1-0 win over Peru in Maturin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salomon Rondon's 41st-minute penalty secured three precious points for Venezuela, who are the only South American team never to have qualified for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Venezuela's win lifted them into seventh place in the table, leaving them on course for an inter-confederation playoff. (AFP)

    World Athletics approves swab test to determine gender

<img alt="The president of the international track and field federation said the female category had to be protected. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797391_1_20250326033236.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World Athletics said on Tuesday it had approved the introduction of a cheek swab test to determine if an athlete is biologically female.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sebastian Coe, the president of the international track and field federation, said the test, whose introduction was given the green light by the World Athletics Council, was a "really important" way of protecting the female category.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it," Coe said in a press conference after the Council met over two days in Nanjing, China following the World Indoor Championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics has not fixed a date for the introduction of the test, but it is expected to be in place for the outdoor World Championships in Tokyo this September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe said the decision to introduce the swab testing was taken after a wide consultation on the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Overwhelmingly, the view has come back that this is absolutely the way to go," Coe said, adding that the swab test was not considered to be overly intrusive.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he was confident that the policy could stand up to legal challenge, but added: "You accept the fact that that is the world we live in.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would never have set off down this path to protect the female category in sport if I'd been anything other than prepared to take the challenge head on.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (difference of sex development) regulations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we'll do whatever is necessary to do it. And we're not just talking about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  World Athletics is looking at cheek swab tests but is also considering using blood spot tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The test for the SRY gene, which is "almost always on the male Y chromosome" and "is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex", would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career, the federation says.
  <br>
  <br>
  Coe warned during his campaign to be elected International Olympic Committee president "that we run the risk of losing women's sport" unless the female category was protected. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China and hosts Singapore battled to a goalless draw on Tuesday night as they began the final round of their AFC Asian Cup football qualifying campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  This extended Hong Kong’s unbeaten run against Singapore to seven games, of which the SAR had secured victories on three occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it was the hosts who dominated the first half, forcing the SAR squad to sub out attacking midfielder Wong Wai for defender Yue Tze-nam in the 34th minute to withstand the pressure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR squad had a much better performance after the break, building a more structured offence, but could not catch a break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts had two goals disallowed, including a lovely chip shot by Shawal Anuar in the 77th minute that was ruled offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will be back to play at Kai Tak Sports Park on June 10 against India for their next qualifying match.
  <br>
  <br>
  To earn a spot in the 2027 Asian Cup finals in Saudi Arabia, the SAR will need to come out on top of Group C, which also features Bangladesh.

 China's hopes of directly qualifying for the 2026 World Cup took a hit after suffering a 2-0 defeat against Australia on Tuesday night.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jackson Irvine scored a brilliant curling shot to open the scoring for the Aussies in the 16th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  An error by China’s goalkeeper Wang Dalei shocked the home crowds at Hangzhou Sports Park Stadium 13 minutes later, as he let a weak shot by Nishan Velupillay slip through his fingers.
  <br>
  <br>
  China made four changes after the break and threw bodies forward in search of a goal but those efforts were in vain.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the loss, the national team stayed at the bottom of the group of six, seven points behind second place Australia with two matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two teams of the group directly qualify for the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  China now need to fight for a fourth-place finish in the group to advance to the fourth qualifying round.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their two remaining group matches are against Indonesia and Bahrain.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Coleman Wong’s history-making performance at the Miami Open will serve as a huge morale boost for the SAR’s next generation of tennis players, Hong Kong, China’s tennis chief said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old became the first-ever player from the SAR to get a win at a Masters 1000 match, and reached the event’s round of 32.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Cheng, president of Hong Kong China Tennis Association, said it was a remarkable achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The draw size of a 1000 event is actually 96, which means that we're putting him inside the top 100 players in the world and he is able to get through a couple of rounds,” he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He's done something which no one has done before in Hong Kong.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The city’s tennis boss said Wong’s groundbreaking result would inspire a lot of young players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “What we're looking at in the tennis generation here overall is to make sure that one generation is better than the last one,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, tennis has retained its "Tier A" sport status for two more years, avoiding a significant funding cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng said the decision is vital to the development of the sport in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It's not just about the funding, but it's also about the coaching and the technical support and the strength and conditioning support and the sports science support coming from the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  “If you put it all together, it's the complete package,” he said.

    Blatter and Platini cleared of graft charges again

<img alt="Michel Platini, left, and Sepp Blatter were cleared of fraud mismanagement by a Swiss court. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797334_1_20250325173315.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court on Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former Fifa president and former Uefa president were acquitted for a second time on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of two million Swiss francs of Fifa money in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers and held his left hand over his mouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.
  <br>
  <br>
  The attorney general’s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter approved Fifa paying the sum to France football great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential adviser from 1998 to 2002.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly nine and a half years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of soccer’s most powerful men.
  <br>
  <br>
  That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at Fifa after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter’s reputation likely always will be tied to leading Fifa during corruption crises that took down a swathe of senior football officials worldwide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, one of football’s greatest players and later Blatter’s protege in the sport's politics, never did get the Fifa presidency he often called his destiny. (AP)

    Relief as billiards keep Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797283_1_20250325120446.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China welcomes the government's decision to retain the sport's Tier A status, saying the impact would have been devastating had the sport been downgraded.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme on Tuesday, Vincent Law said the retention announcement, made a day ago, comes as a relief to both athletes and coaches, as it allows them to focus on training.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he stressed that athletes would still face the pressure of having to perform well for the sport to retain the status in the next review, which will be held in two years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law pointed out that billiard has been an elite sport since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we had dropped to Tier B this year, our funding would have been cut by about 80 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Therefore, if we just look at it from a funding standpoint, it would already have been a great loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But a more severe blow would be the billiards' sector having to quit the Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There would no longer be a billiard sports department, meaning that our training facilities, coaches – as well as the support that players get, such as accommodation – would all go."
  <br>
  <br>
  Law also said the move to retain the sport's status will allow the public to get to know more about billiards, and he believes more children will also try out the sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  If there are more venues in the SAR that allow us to stage competitions, that will also help promote the sport, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will increase from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute and a Sports Commission member, said he hopes the increment can offer more stable lifestyles for athletes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said the commission took reference from the salaries given to management trainees at various organisations before coming up with the figure.

    De Minaur finds way through Fonseca fervor in Miami

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but de Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.
  <br>
  <br>
  But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last," de Minaur said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in two hours and 15 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while," said Osaka.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's rising tennis star Coleman Wong on Monday fell short of a third round victory at this year's Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old fell to Australian Adam Walton, who won 7-6, 4-6, 6-4 in a match-up that lasted for two hours and 18 minutes at the Hard Rock Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong previously pulled off a stunning win of his own in Miami, beating American 13th seed Ben Shelton.
  <br>
  <br>
  His victory provided him with a place in the third round of a Masters 1000 for the first time in his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong – currently ranked 182th in the world – was the second-lowest ranked player to reach the Miami Open third round in 10 years.

    Billiards, tennis retain Tier A status
   </title>

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797192_1_20250324223333.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Monday that tennis and billiards have retained their Tier A sport status for two years, avoiding a downgrade that would result in significant funding cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law also announced the promotion of golf as a Tier A sport, and canoeing and para swimming to Tier B status, effective from April 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Elite Sports Committee, overseen by the Sports Commission, reviews athlete performances at major international competitions biennially to determine the amount of support each sport gets from the Hong Kong Sports Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports are classified into three levels of Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming, cycling and table tennis are among the disciplines in the top tier and classified as the ones with the best chances to do well at the Olympic Games, and athletes receive the strongest resources as a result.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, to be classified as Tier A, a sport is required to be included in at least three of the past four or the next two Olympic or Asian Games, which billiards failed to meet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after chairing a Sports Commission meeting, Law said adjustments were made to accommodate sports with unique strengths, including billiards, to stay in the city's elite sports training system.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We will count from 1997, the year that we started to compete in the name of Hong Kong, China, from then till now at least three times a sport will have to be included in either Olympic or Asian Games," she said. "Billiard sports will meet the criteria upon this adjustment."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for tennis, the sports minister said officials would also consider results of other major tournaments apart from the Olympics or Asian Games, such as the Grand Slam events.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law cited the performance of local tennis star Coleman Wong, who is making history at the Miami Open as the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is an adjustment that is fitting for tennis in which we are also making good performances recently.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is a system that is ever-evolving in light of the latest development of the sports sector. And we will continue to see if adjustment is necessary in the future times to come,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sports Commission also agreed to give all elite athletes an 8.3 percent increase in direct government grants starting next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the minimum monthly grant for full-time athletes will go up from HK$7,130 to HK$10,000.

    Appeal crunch time for Blatter and Platini

<img alt="Michael Platini, left, with Sepp Blatter in 2014. File Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797152_1_20250324151246.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter and France football great Michel Platini will appear before a Swiss court on Tuesday to hear whether the case that finished their careers in football will end with their acquittals or convictions for corruption.
 <br>
  <br>
  The pair, once among the most powerful figures in global football, will appear at the extraordinary appeals chamber of the Swiss Criminal Court two-and-a-half years after they were acquitted of fraud.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swiss federal prosecutors rejected the decision at a lower court from 2022, leading to the new hearing in the town of Muttenz, near Basel. Both men deny the charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The case relates to a two million Swiss franc payment Blatter authorised for Platini, a former captain and manager of the French national team, which was made in 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini and Blatter said the payment was a consultancy fee paid to Platini for work between 1998 and 2002, which the Frenchman said had been partly deferred because Fifa lacked the funds to pay him in full immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  The affair, which emerged in 2015 when Platini was president of European soccer body Uefa, torpedoed his hopes of eventually succeeding Blatter at the top of Fifa.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter and Platini were suspended from football in 2015 by Fifa for ethics breaches, originally for eight years. Although their exclusions were later reduced, the ban ended their careers as senior football administrators. The 2022 indictment accused Blatter and Platini of deceiving Fifa staff in 2010 and 2011 about an obligation for world soccer's ruling body to pay Platini.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They falsely claimed that Fifa owed Platini, or that Platini was entitled to, the sum of two million Swiss francs for advisory work. This deception was achieved through repeated untruthful claims made by both accused parties," the indictment said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair were cleared in the 2022 case after a judge accepted that their account of a "gentlemen's agreement" for the payment was credible, while there were serious doubts about the prosecution's allegation the payment was fraudulent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter, who was Fifa president for 17 years until 2015, has insisted he had done nothing wrong. Now a frail 89-year-old, he said he was the victim of a witch-hunt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platini, a three-times European Footballer of the Year, insisted the money was related to backpay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no corruption, there's no swindling, there's nothing at all," he said at the start of the appeal.
  <br>
  <br>
  His lawyer Dominic Nellen said the case was designed to stop Platini becoming Fifa president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Platini was the most likely successor to Blatter in 2015, but someone wanted him out of the way," Nellen said. "At every turn there seems to be an attempt to stop Platini becoming president of Fifa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Blatter was eventually replaced by Gianni Infantino, who had worked for Platini at Uefa. Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, Platini, was banned from football.
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino has denied helping to bring about Platini's downfall, and said he only stepped up when Uefa asked him after the allegations against Platini emerged.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prosecutors want a sentence of 20 months in jail, suspended for two years for both Blatter and Platini, and to confiscate the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides can appeal against the judgement to the Swiss Federal Court, the country's highest legal authority. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italy striker Moise Kean admitted his team "got distracted" after Germany's Jamal Musiala scored an easy goal into an empty net when absent-minded goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma left his post during the Nations League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Germany saw off Italy 5-4 on aggregate following a 3-3 second-leg draw to reach the semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Kimmich, who scored the first goal for Germany, played a key role in the bizarre second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donnarumma left his goal after making a save to complain at the referee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kimmich, seeing the Italian keeper had drifted off his line, took a quickly-taken corner that was flicked into the empty net by Musiala.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got distracted. It can happen to concede goals like that. We'll work better on it next time," said Kean who scored twice in the second half as Italy rallied from a 3-0 interval deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said the quick thinking was "world-class and unbelievably smart," and admitted "I didn't see it at all."
  <br>
  <br>
  One person who did see it was 15-year-old ballboy Noel Urbaniak who noticed that Donnarumma wasn't paying attention and quickly threw the ball to Kimmich.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was very sharp, which isn't bad in a game like this, he did well," said Kimmich who autographed and presented a match ball to the teenager after the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He'll get a free ticket to the next home game," promised German football federation Rudi Voller.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've never been a ballboy before, this is my first time, and it feels really good," Urbaniak said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy coach Luciano Spalletti blasted his team's lack of maturity over the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We saw that they take corners quickly and must not turn our backs," said Spalletti. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva, coming off back-to-back WTA 1000 wins in Dubai and Indian Wells, exited in the third round, her 13-match winning streak ending with a three-sets loss to American Amanda Anisimova.
 <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva, the 11th seed, hoped to continue her rise up the rankings with a strong showing in Miami but appeared to be hampered by injury as she lost to 17th seeded Miami resident Anisimova.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andreeva received lengthy medical attention in her abdominal area when 2-1 down in the first set, which she lost 7-6 (7/5).
  <br>
  <br>
  She bounced back, dominating the second set 6-2 but Anisimova won the third set of the two hour and 49-minute battle 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anisimova will face Emma Raducanu in the fourth round, after the British player advanced when her American opponent McCartney Kessler retired injured in the second set of their encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic broke the record for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins with his 6-1 7-6 (7/1) win over Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb's 411th win at this level takes him past the previous record set by Nadal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian veteran David Goffin, who eliminated world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round, fell to American Brandon Nakashima, who won 6-3 6-7 (5/7) 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas, who won his first title in over a year last month at Dubai, fell to 24th-seeded American Sebastian Korda 7-6 (7/4), 6-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's awesome. I was born in Florida. My whole family is here. It's just a lot of fun to play here and get my first Top 10 win of the year," said Korda.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I tried to serve well, tried to come to the net when I could, and I'm just happy with my performance today," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov battled to a 6-7 (3/7), 6-4, 7-5 win over Karen Khachanov in a contest in which the baseline predictably dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old's victory, secured over two hours and 38 minutes, made Dimitrov the fourth active player to tally 100 Masters 1000 hard-court wins.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's great. Last year I think I hit 100 wins indoors, now this. It's beautiful I think every time you hit such a milestone," said Dimitrov.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know each other very well, we practice with each other a lot, so there weren't really secrets. At the end of the day, it came down to a few points."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils delighted his supporters defeating Spaniard Jaume Munar 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7/1). (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 NBA Eastern Conference leader Cleveland snapped a four-game losing streak with a balanced scoring performance in a 120-91 victory at Utah.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jarrett Allen scored 18 points and Donovan Mitchell added 16 to lead six Cavaliers in double figures while Evan Mobley added 11 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a long season. We're going to go through some ups and downs, we're not going to play our best," Mitchell said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If this streak had happened in November I don't think everybody would be tripping as much. This is all part of the season. It's all part of getting better. Won tonight. We've turned the corner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs, with the NBA's second-best record, improved to 57-14 after prior road trip losses at the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento and Phoenix, while the Jazz, with the NBA's second-worst record, fell to 16-56.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland stretched the lead atop the East to five and a half games over defending NBA champion Boston but remain one and a half games behind Oklahoma City (58-12) for the NBA's best overall record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 15-0 run to open the second half lifted the Cavs ahead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got some stops and then got in transition and made some shots. That helped," Mitchell said. "This is a great win. Now we're got to continue to take care of business."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kyle Filipowski led Utah with 18 points and 13 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Detroit, rookie forward Ronald Holland scored 26 points off the bench to lead the Pistons over visiting New Orleans 136-130.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Duren added 22 points and 12 rebounds for Detroit, which improved to 40-32.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Goalkeeper Mike Maignan saved twice in the shoot-out as France beat Croatia 5-4 on penalties after their Uefa Nations League quarter-final tie had ended 2-2 on aggregate, sealing a place in the last four in June.
 <br>
  <br>
  Les Bleus won 2-0 on the night with goals in normal time by Michael Olise and Ousmane Dembele at the Stade de France to wipe out their deficit from Thursday's first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  With no further scoring in extra time the tie went to penalties, where Maignan saved from both Martin Baturina and Josip Stanisic, while Franjo Ivanovic also missed his kick for the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez both failed to convert for the hosts, but Dayot Upamecano scored when he became the seventh France player to step up, sparking scenes of celebrations on the pitch and in the crowd of 77,502.
  <br>
  <br>
  France, who won the Nations League in 2021, will now take on title-holders Spain in the semi-finals in Germany on June 5, with the winners going through to the final three days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile Croatia, who lost on penalties to Spain in the final of the last edition of the Nations League in 2023, will now start their qualifying campaign for the 2026 World Cup in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will go into qualifying Group L with the Czech Republic, Montenegro, the Faroe Islands and Gibraltar.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's progress to the final stages of the Nations League means they will not begin their World Cup qualifying campaign until September, when they will be in Group D with Ukraine, Iceland and Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Nations League holders Spain reached the final four with a 5-4 win on penalties against the Netherlands, after a thrilling 3-3 quarter-final second leg draw had left the tie 5-5 on aggregate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donyell Malen missed and Barcelona's Pedri slotted home to settle a gripping match in which the Netherlands came from behind three times to force the shoot-out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Oyarzabal opened the scoring for Spain but Memphis Depay levelled from the penalty spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed Spain's second before Ian Maatsen rifled home to force extra-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona starlet Lamine Yamal, who also missed a penalty in the shoot-out, scored a brilliant goal to put Spain ahead but Xavi Simons netted another spot-kick to force penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so nice to wear this shirt and to be able to score this goal," Pedri said, with his side facing France in the semi-finals. "We're Spain and we don't have to fear anyone."
  <br>
  <br>
  After Spain's struggles in Rotterdam on Thursday in the 2-2 first-leg draw, coach Luis de la Fuente made a handful of changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal and Dani Olmo came in for Alvaro Morata and Pedri, while Dean Huijsen made his first start, against the country of his birth, and excelled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman brought in debutant Maatsen at left-back, giving him the unenviable challenge of shackling 17-year-old prodigy Yamal at Valencia's sold-out Mestalla stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spain's success in recent years has inspired their supporters and over 20,000 watched them train ahead of the second leg, which also served as a fundraiser for damage caused by the devastating storms which hit the Valencia region last October.
  <br>
  <br>
  They won a penalty early on when Jan Paul van Hecke clumsily brought down Oyarzabal, who scored the winning goal for La Roja in the Euro 2024 final last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Sociedad forward took it himself, smashing into the bottom right corner, past Bart Verbruggen's dive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal had a goal ruled out for offside and the Brighton goalkeeper denied Nico Williams with a superb stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth centre-back Huijsen, 19, was jeered by the travelling Dutch fans, upset he did not choose to play for them, but Spain supporters backed him in response and he shone. (AFP)

    Filipino teenager Eala sends Keys packing in Miami

<img alt="Eala is the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since 1975. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797077_1_20250324055913.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifth-seeded American Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion, crashed out of the Miami Open suffering a shock loss to 19-year-old Filipino wildcard Alexandra Eala.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 6-4, 6-2 win for the teenager prompted her to hug her team and celebrate passionately after she became the first Filipino woman in the Open Era to beat a top-10 opponent since the ranking system came into being in 1975.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eala, the 2022 U.S. Open girls' singles champion, who has been based to the Rafael Nadal academy in Mallorca since she was 13, will now take on Spain's Paula Badosa for a spot in the quarterfinals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growing up it was tough," Eala said in her on-court interview. "You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think – I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Keys, who was badly beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in the Indian Wells semi-finals, conceded she was well short of her best form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat – and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success," said the American.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek overcame a determined Elise Mertens to secure a 7-6 (7/2), 6-1 victory and take her place in the last 16 at a WTA 1000 tournament for a record 25th straight event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-seeded Swiatek has not lost before the last 16 at this level since Cincinnati 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pole was 5-2 up in the first set but Mertens fought back to make it 5-5 before Swiatek was able to regain her dominance in the tie-break. (AFP)

    Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen wins 1,500m in Nanjing

<img alt="Norway’s Jakob Ingebrigtsen celebrates after winning the men’s 1500m final during the Indoor World Athletics Championships in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797058_1_20250323214422.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Norway's Jakob Ingebrigtsen won the 1,500m in Nanjing on Sunday to claim not only a first global gold in his favoured distance, but also a rare world indoor track distance double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, who had won the 3,000m on Saturday for his first world indoor title, clocked 3min 38.79sec to emulate the double claimed by Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie in Maebashi in 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's Neil Gourley took silver in 3:39.07 while American Luke Houser rounded out the podium (3:39.17).
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course this is something special," said Ingebrigtsen, before adding: "A lot of things have changed and I'm not doing this because anyone else has done it before. So that's purely a coincidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to compare yourself against history and what others are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm only focusing on myself and I feel good to have done a lot of preparations, and that was always the main goal. It's not to do with something somebody else did before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I can do more, so I'll try to maximise that and grab the opportunity given to me."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen's victory also banished some of the Norwegian's 1,500m demons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The main goal is obviously to win both distances, but I would say so far a pretty good indoor season, getting out and succeeding with the things that I wanted to accomplish, so it's been good," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen, as his wont, was happy to sit at the back of the nine-strong pack as American Samuel Prakel took up the running in Nanjing, splitting the pack into single file.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian moved to the front with four laps to run, Britain's Gourley on his shoulder and Mariano Garcia of Spain also in the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ingebrigtsen surged again, shouldering off Austrian veteran Raphael Pallitsch's clumsy attempt at a pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next to try their luck was Portugal's Isaac Nader, but at the bell it was Ingebrigtsen in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gourley raced down the inside line of the far straight, but there was to be no Briton to spoil the party at the line, as there has been twice at the world outdoors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Norwegian kept not only his speed but also his nerve to see off his rivals, crossing the finish line with a brief look over his shoulder and a wagging index finger. (AFP)

    Reed qualifies for British Open after Macau finish

<img alt="Patrick Reed playing a shot during the final round of the 2025 International Series Macau at the Macau Golf and Country Club in Macau.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Masters champion Patrick Reed qualified for the British Open after coming second behind fellow LIV player Carlos Ortiz at the International Series Macau on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Mexican Ortiz also earned his spot at the major in Portrush, Northern Ireland, in July, after holding off the American for a three-shot victory at the Asian Tour event in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jason Kokrak also qualified as he finished third at Macau Golf and Country Club, three shots further back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American was one shot ahead of the 2017 Masters champion and another LIV player in Sergio Garcia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard missed a three-footer for birdie on the last which would have seen him tie with Kokrak and secure a place at the British Open through countback based on his higher world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Macau tournament was added this year to the Open Qualifying Series for the first time, with the top three players who are not already exempt earning a berth at the British Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  LIV players do not earn world-ranking points, severely restricting their chances of qualifying for golf's four major tournaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ortiz carded a final-round six-under-par 64 to triumph with a total 22-under.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, had shared the lead with Ortiz heading into the final round but had to settle for a runner-up finish after carding a 67.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reed's best performance at the British Open was 10th in 2019. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ticket sales for the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens are breaking records less than one week before the event kicks off at the Kai Tak Sports Park, according to the event's organiser.
 <br>
  <br>
  The highly-anticipated mega event will take place from March 28 to 30 at the brand new Kai Tak Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China Rugby said 43,000 tickets have been sold, including 8,000 in the past week alone.
  <br>
  <br>
  With a capacity of 47,000, that means over 90 percent of all tickets have been snapped up. Only three-day passes remain, with each adult ticket costing HK$1,950.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organiser expects a total attendance of 138,000 over three days, a new record for the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Brooke, chairman of Hong Kong, China Rugby said the SAR squad is ready to compete, and is excited to be entering a new era of rugby history with the move away from Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our Hong Kong, China teams have reached great heights both on the world stage and in the neighborhoods across the city. We look forward to together capitalising on the new opportunities presented by Kai Tak for our community," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR men's and women's squads will be competing in the Melrose Claymores, a tournament which runs in parallel to the main Sevens competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The men's team will be aiming to defend their Melrose title, facing China on Friday and Japan on Saturday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the women's team, who finished as runners-up to China last year, will play Kazakhstan on the opening day and Thailand next.

<img alt="McLaren's Oscar Piastri celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix with second placed McLaren's Lando Norris and third placed Mercedes' George Russell. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797037_1_20250323172831.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oscar Piastri led from pole to win the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren used a one-stop strategy to complete a dominant one-two with Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  George Russell was third in a Mercedes with Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen snatching fourth place after a thrilling late pass on Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lewis Hamilton came home sixth behind his teammate after his first Ferrari victory in Saturday's sprint race in Shanghai, when Piastri had been second.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an incredible weekend, the car has been pretty mega," said the Australian Piastri, who had been running second a week ago in Melbourne' season-opener before a late spin.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Very, very happy. The hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, so to go all the way to the end was a bit of a surprise, but a happy surprise."
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris had to cope with a late brake issue which forced him to settle for second rather than challenge his teammate.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Briton continues to lead the championship after two race weekends on 44 points from Verstappen on 36.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell started from second and knew it was imperative to try to grab the lead off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Instead he was squeezed by Piastri on the long first bend complex, which allowed Norris to surge past into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Ferraris got past Verstappen on the same bend, relegating the world champion from fourth to sixth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leclerc lost part of his front wing when it brushed Hamilton's rear right wheel but it did not affect his pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton was the first of the front-runners to dive in for new rubber on lap 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the others followed for hard tyres with Russell getting past Norris in the melee.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the McLaren showed superior pace and surged back past at the end of the pit straight with the help of DRS.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton began to struggle on the hard compound and allowed his teammate past on lap 21 freeing Leclerc to go after Russell.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 38 Hamilton had to pit again for new tyres, dropping him behind Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The front five all stayed out as it became clear they were going to attempt to make the hard tyres last till the end of the 56 laps.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen had nursed his tyres throughout the race which enabled him to have a late charge on Leclerc and pass the Ferrari at the start of lap 54.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haas finished with two cars in the points as Esteban Ocon was seventh and rookie Ollie Bearman 10th.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other points scorers were Mercedes teenager Kimi Antonelli in eighth with Alex Albon ninth in his Williams on his 29th birthday. (AFP)

 Hong Kong tennis star Coleman Wong pulled off the biggest triumph of his career in dramatic fashion, defeating 13th seed Ben Shelton of the United States at the Miami Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old wildcard prevailed 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 in a thrilling three setter, despite letting slip a 5-2 lead in the final set.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always trust myself to play in these big stages," an emotional Wong said after the match. "This is for you Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong, currently ranked 182th in the world, becomes the second-lowest ranked player to reach the tournament's last 32 in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  He already made history by beating world number 82 Daniel Altmaier of Germany in the first round, becoming the first player from Hong Kong to ever record a Masters 1000 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR's top men's player will next face Australia's Adam Walton, the lucky loser who's also enjoying a magical run at the prestigious Masters 1000 event.

    Oscar Piastri on pole for Chinese Grand Prix

<img alt="Now in his third season in Formula One, the Australian already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796987_1_20250323065602.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pumped Oscar Piastri seized his first Formula One pole position at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday and said he had done the hairpin of his life to smash the Shanghai circuit record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Australian, who had previously only secured the top slot for 100km sprint races, told reporters his qualifying time of one minute 30.641 seconds was secured at the end of the straight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My first lap was honestly better than my second lap, but just at the hairpin at the end of the straight I lost a bit of time and didn’t do the best hairpin," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And then the second lap I was about two-tenths down on myself, so I kind of just went 'why not send it into the hairpin?' and I gained those two-tenths back and then found a little bit more in the last corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Honestly, without that, I was tempted to box (pit) before that. So I’m pretty happy now that I didn’t...I just did a good corner, that’s all."
  <br>
  <br>
  As he told his team over the radio, it was "the hairpin of my life".
  <br>
  <br>
  Now in his third season in Formula One, Piastri already has two wins to his name and starts as favourite for a third on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  That would make up for the crushing disappointment of starting on the front row in his home race in Melbourne last weekend and sliding off while chasing winning team mate Lando Norris before finishing ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris leads the championship on 26 points, with Piastri level with Ferrari's sprint winner Lewis Hamilton on nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pole was the first for an Australian driver since Daniel Ricciardo for Red Bull in Mexico in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm a racing driver, so I'm selfish. So it's nice to do it for myself but it is also nice to do it for Australia as well," said the 23-year-old, who added that he has Chinese heritage.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The pole position is a really good confidence boost. It’s obviously my first one. So it's always nice to tick that box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been a good start to the whole year for both the team and myself, even if the points tally doesn’t look like that at the moment. So (I'm) happy with how things are going, and this is a nice step along the way." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kevin Durant scored 42 points as the Phoenix Suns reignited their playoff hopes with a 123-112 upset of the Eastern Conference-leading Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A superb performance from Durant secured a third straight victory for Phoenix as they aim to muscle their way into the postseason picture in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Durant erupted for 19 points in a third-quarter burst of scoring that took the game beyond Cleveland's grasp, with the Suns opening up a 98-79 lead heading into the fourth quarter which they never looked like letting slip.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifted Phoenix into 10th place in the Western Conference and into the play-in tournament reckoning.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six teams in each NBA conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while teams placed from 7th to 10th play in a mini-tournament to determine the final two playoff berths.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is the best team in the league," Durant said of Cleveland following the Suns win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've been struggling and we know we've got the toughest schedule for the last 10 games," he added. "So we just wanted to dial in and make sure we kept building on the work we've done over the last week."
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland's fourth consecutive loss leaves the second-placed Boston Celtics just five wins behind the Cavs at the top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics improved to 51-19 after thrashing the Utah Jazz 121-99 on the back of 27 points from Kristaps Porzingis and 26 points from Jayson Tatum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Detroit Pistons' progress towards the playoffs suffered a jolt in a surprising 123-117 defeat on the road to the struggling Dallas Mavericks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mavs – whose season has been blown off course by the trade of Luka Doncic to the Lakers and a season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving – powered to a precious victory thanks to 31 points from Spencer Dinwiddie and 27 from PJ Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result leaves Dallas perched on the edge of playoff contention in 11th place with a 34-37 record in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Detroit occupy the sixth and last automatic playoff berth in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the loss, the Pistons will fancy their chances of locking down a postseason ticket given a vastly superior record – 39-32 – to seventh-placed Atlanta (33-36).
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder celebrated their successful clinching of the number 1 seeding on Thursday with a ruthless 141-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Thunder were assured of top spot in the West despite not playing on Thursday after the Los Angeles Lakers' defeat to Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 30 points as no fewer than eight OKC players finished in double figures in a wire-to-win which leaves the Thunder with a 58-12 record at the top of the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said he wanted to see his team play with the same intensity for the remainder of the regular season as they build towards the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We got to play with a sense of purpose – you can't coast into the postseason," Daigneault said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great 48-minute effort. We played to our standards on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  With OKC already assured of top spot, Houston boosted their hopes of clinching second place in the West after rallying from 11 points down to squeeze past the Miami Heat, winning 102-98 on the road to bag their ninth consecutive win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet was the key man for Houston, finishing with 37 points after a devastating exhibition of long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  VanVleet drained nine-of-11 attempts from outside the arc as the Rockets improved to 46-25.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Minnesota Timberwolves remain hard on the heels of the sixth-placed Golden State Warriors (41-29) in the race for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Wolves, who are one place behind Golden State, improved to 41-31 after a 134-93 pasting of the New Orleans Pelicans.
  <br>
  <br>
  In another upset, the Portland Trail Blazers outgunned the injury-hit Denver Nuggets 128-109. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lewis Hamilton dominated from pole position to take his maiden victory for Ferrari in the sprint race at the Chinese Grand Prix on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton, on just his second race weekend for the Scuderia, took the chequered flag ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton emerged from his car after the finish line to a crescendo of cheers from the massed Shanghai fans who unfurled huge banners displaying the Englishman's number 44.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think people underestimate the steep climb it is to get into a new team, understand a new team," said a delighted Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it is great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car as in Melbourne I really didn't feel comfortable in the car.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It felt great today, I got a good start. I don't feel the pressure, I know the team wants to win and it means everything to them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rome wasn't built in a day, so one day at a time."
  <br>
  <br>
  His former teammate at Mercedes, George Russell, was fourth and his current teammate Charles Leclerc was fifth in the other Ferrari.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda in an RB was sixth, Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes was seventh and championship leader Lando Norris, who struggled for pace, took a solitary point in eighth for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hamilton got away safely from pole after setting a blistering lap record on Friday at the resurfaced 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of lap three he was 1.1 seconds ahead and out of DRS range from Verstappen with Piastri a further 1.6 seconds back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris started sixth but was caught up in traffic on turn five and dropped to ninth, outside the points, as he was passed by Antonelli, Tsunoda and Lance Stroll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russell took advantage of the melee to nip past Leclerc into fourth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen ran in second but was put under huge pressure by Piastri with five laps to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both of my front tyres are dead," the Dutch reigning world champion complained on team radio.
  <br>
  <br>
  On lap 16 Piastri got past Verstappen at the hairpin and set off after Hamilton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Australian could not make inroads and the Englishman managed his tyres to perfection in the clean air at the front of the field. (AFP)

    Boxing legend George Foreman dies aged 76

<img alt="The former heavyweight boxing champion is renowned for his iconic battle with Muhammad Ali. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796902_1_20250322102434.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, who fought and lost against Muhammad Ali in boxing's iconic 1974 "Rumble in the Jungle" before reclaiming the title two decades later, died on Friday aged 76, his family announced in a statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  "With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones," Foreman's family said in a statement posted on the boxer's official Instagram page.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own."
  <br>
  <br>
  Born in Texas on January 10, 1949, Foreman grew up in Houston. The man who raised him was frequently absent and often drunk. Foreman only found out that J. D. Foreman was not his biological father after he won the world heavyweight when his real father, a decorated Second World War veteran, got in touch.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an adolescent Foreman flirted with crime and dropped out of school at 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood," his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024. "And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 16, he took up boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to a football player," Foreman said on his website. "I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist."
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Mexico Games in 1968, the 19-year-old Foreman bludgeoned his way to the super-heavyweight gold. As he celebrated his final victory, 10 days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos had made a black power salute following the 200m track final, Foreman waved an American flag in the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  At 6-foot-4 (1.93m), 'Big George' was larger and stronger than the other leading heavyweights of the time. He was light on his feet, but slugged his way through the professional ranks, to earn a heavyweight title shot against champion Joe Frazier, demolishing the champion in two rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the time he fought his third title defence over 15 rounds against Ali in October 1974 in Kinshasa, Foreman was unbeaten in 40 professional bouts. He had won all but three inside the distance and had not needed to develop stamina.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ali's 'rope-a-dope' tactics, exhausted the big man who lost in eight rounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat punctured Foreman's intimidating aura, not least, in his own mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title," he said later. "It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating."
  <br>
  <br>
  His campaign for another title shot ended when he lost on points to another contender, Jimmy Young in March 1977 on a hot night in Puerto Rico.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman fell ill after the fight and said he sensed God telling him to change his life.
  <br>
  <br>
  He retired, aged 28 and became an ordained minister. When he announced his comeback 10 years later, bald where he had once sported an afro and flabby instead of chiseled, it seemed like a boxing gimmick. He wrote later that he needed money for his youth centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  - Knockout -
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the next three years he fought 21 times, mostly against mediocre opponents, winning every bout, 20 of them inside the distance.
  <br>
  <br>
  A big name in a weakened and fragmented division, he earned a title shot against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and then against Tommy Morrison two years later, losing both on points.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November 1994 he faced Michael Moorer, who had dethroned Holyfield. In the same shorts he had worn 20 years and six days earlier against Ali, Foreman was trailing badly when he caught Moorer on the chin in the 10th for a knockout. At 45 years and 299 days old he was the oldest heavyweight world champion.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was stripped of first his WBA title and then his IBF title for refusing to fight nominated opponents but won three more fights and was still 'lineal' world champion when he lost on points to Shannon Briggs in 1997, aged 48, and retired again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He fought 81 times as a professional, winning 76, 68 of those by a knockout.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 1994, he put his name to the "George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine", appearing smiling and friendly in the TV ads, becoming a celebrity outside boxing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Foreman, who hosted a 1996 TV programme 'Bad Dads', married four times, fathering 10 children and adopting two.
  <br>
  <br>
  He named all his five sons George Edward, explaining that he wanted them to know, "'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!'" (AFP)

    Tuchel starts his reign as England coach with a win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thomas Tuchel made a winning start to his England reign without delivering on his promise of a vibrant new era as the Three Lions beat Albania 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel had urged England to play without fear after claiming they were "afraid" in a scathing assessment of their Euro 2024 runners-up finish under his predecessor Gareth Southgate.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the early returns were underwhelming as Tuchel's side dominated possession at Wembley without providing much entertainment for the sell-out 82,378 crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  While it is far too early to judge Tuchel, the German -- England's third non-British manager -- must know significant improvements are needed on the road to next year's World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aged 18 years and 176 days, Myles Lewis-Skelly made history in the first half when the Arsenal defender became the youngest player to score on his England debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was the highlight of an inconsistent England display which was hard to distinguish from the erratic fare served up by Southgate during his eight years in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  England captain Harry Kane, who played under Tuchel at Bayern Munich last season, netted late in the second half to put a more flattering gloss on the Group K opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 31-year-old's 70th international goal came just 24 hours after England's record scorer claimed people were "bored" of his achievements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel was greeted with a banner unfurled by fans with the slogan "Welcome to the home of football Thomas" as he walked out of the tunnel before kick-off.

  True to his word, Tuchel did not sing the English national anthem after saying he had to "earn the right" and there were few songs of praise for Tuchel as Wembley started to empty well before the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel, whose side host Latvia on Monday, at least avoiding become the first England boss since Bobby Robson in 1982 to fail to win his first match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel gave debuts to Lewis-Skelly and Newcastle defender Dan Burn, who scored in Sunday's League Cup final win at Wembley, while Marcus Rashford was given a starting berth after his revival on loan at Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three looked comfortable in Tuchel's 4-2-3-1 formation but England could only muster a workmanlike start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel stood in the technical area making occasional notes and clapping vigorously when England followed his demand for a high press to win the ball back.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German was even more animated in the 20th minute as his decision to select Lewis-Skelly paid rich dividends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jude Bellingham was the catalyst as he deftly turned to find space in midfield before stroking a sublime pass towards Lewis-Skelly, who timed his run perfectly to slot home from close-range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel pumped his arms in celebration, with a sheepish grin spreading across his face.
  <br>
  <br>
  The smile was nearly wiped from his face when Burn's miscued block from Qazim Laci's cross hit the bar in a panicked sequence that ended with the defender heading off the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham's diving header was repelled by Thomas Strakosha before Kane's follow-up was brilliantly blocked by Berat Djimsiti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Burn almost reprised his Wembley goal against Liverpool last weekend with a towering header that clanged off the bar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuchel's hope that England would play with more intensity wasn't helped by the soporific atmosphere, a stark contrast the Premier League passion he wants his team to emulate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kane headed narrowly wide from Bellingham's cross after the interval, but England laboured to kill off an Albania side content to sit deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  They finally landed the knockout blow in the 77th minute as Declan Rice's cross reached Kane and he swivelled to curl into the far corner from 10 yards. (AFP)
