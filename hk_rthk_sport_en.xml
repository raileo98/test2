<div class="itemFullText">
 European champions England will renew their rivalry with France and the Netherlands, and also clash with debutants Wales in the group stage of the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament after the draw was made in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br>
  World Cup winners Spain, second in the Fifa rankings and hungry to claim a first Euro title, should have an easier path against Group B opponents Portugal, Belgium and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight-times European champions Germany, who are ranked third in the world, are in Group C with Poland, Denmark and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hosts Switzerland will play Norway, Iceland and Finland in Group A and will kick off the tournament on July 2 against the Norwegians in Basel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being holders, Sarina Wiegman's England team were placed in Pot 2 of the draw after finishing second behind France by a point in their Euro qualifying group, with the two teams splitting their qualifying games with identical 2-1 scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  England face France in their group opener on July 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding more drama to what should be a blockbuster group stage, familiar foes the Netherlands – Wiegman's home country and former team – kept the Lionesses out of the Paris Olympics by finishing ahead of them in the Nations League. The two teams will meet on July 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiegman is the only manager to have won the women's Euros with two different countries, having also lifted the trophy with the Dutch in 2017. (Reuters)

<img alt="The SAR lacrosse squad fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout. Photo courtesy of Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783618_1_20241216121924.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

    Bills defeat Lions in blockbuster; Chiefs roll on

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen leaps across the goal line for his second touchdown against the Lions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783650_1_20241216110904.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen delivered another barnstorming performance with two rushing touchdowns, as the Buffalo Bills handed the Detroit Lions only their second defeat of the season with a 48-42 NFL victory at Ford Field on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blockbuster clash between the two high-scoring potential Super Bowl contenders did not disappoint, with Bills quarterback Allen once again underscoring his credentials as the front-runner for this season's Most Valuable Player award.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who rushed for three touchdowns and threw three more in Buffalo's defeat to the Los Angeles Rams last week, was in commanding form with 362 passing yards from 23-of-34 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bills running back James Cook also played a key role with two touchdowns and 105 rushing yards, which included one 41-yard sprint to the end zone in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Buffalo were always in control after racing into an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Detroit's offence kept the Lions in touch – with quarterback Jared Goff throwing five touchdowns and 494 passing yards in a game that saw the two teams combine for nearly 1,100 yards of offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills improved to 11-3 with the win, while Detroit fell to 12-2 to leave the Lions tied in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles – who defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for 290 yards with two touchdowns, and rushed for one more to set up the Philadelphia win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for two touchdowns but suffered a late injury scare as Kansas City eased to a 21-7 win over the Cleveland Browns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes limped off the field midway through the fourth quarter of a win that leaves Kansas City on 13-1, putting them on course to secure post-season home-field advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes was uncertain as to the severity of the injury but said he could have played on if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually you have to wait until the day after to get a good sense of it," Mahomes said. "I could have finished the game in different circumstances." (AFP)

    Man Utd deepen Guardiola's gloom; Chelsea cruise

<img alt="Manchester United's Leny Yoro battles for the ball with City midfielder Jack Grealish. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783632_1_20241216101239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United scored two late goals to deepen the pain for beleaguered Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, as Chelsea moved just two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on a day of high drama in the English top flight, Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and Southampton boss Russell Martin were both sacked, paying the price for their teams' struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the marquee game of the day at the Etihad, City defender Josko Gvardiol opened the scoring, but Bruno Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot in the 88th minute and Amad Diallo struck two minutes later to seal a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions City – who have dominated English football over the past decade – now have just one win in 11 games in all competitions and Guardiola is desperately searching for answers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a defence, I'm the boss, I'm the manager – I have to find a solution, and I don't find a solution," said the Catalan after the low-quality encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a big club, when you lose eight out of 11, something wrong is happening," he added. "What can I say? The schedule is tough, the injured players? No. I'm the boss, I'm the manager and I'm not good enough – it's as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men trail leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand, by nine points and sit outside the Champions League places, in fifth spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-ravaged City were far from their best at the Etihad but appeared to be on course for a vital win as the clock ticked down against their neighbours before they self-imploded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Nunes' sloppy back pass was cut out by Diallo and the Portuguese midfielder then chopped down the United winger in his attempt to make amends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes coolly converted from the penalty spot to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo then raced onto a simple long ball over the top of City's flat-footed defence, finishing neatly to complete a remarkable turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win is a huge relief for new United boss Ruben Amorim, who had won just one of his first four Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for the fans it has a deep meaning, especially in this context, in this moment," the former Sporting Lisbon boss said after his first experience of a Manchester derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a difficult moment one week ago against Nottingham Forest at home with a storm," he added. "It was a really tough moment after the game. Today, we are more happy, but it's three points that we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  United finished the day 13th in the Premier League table – where they started – after Tottenham hammered bottom club Southampton 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca's high-flying Chelsea beat Brentford 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to close to within two points of long-time leaders Liverpool, who have 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home team dominated the first half and got the reward they deserved shortly before the break when Marc Cucurella nodded home Noni Madueke's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson doubled Chelsea's lead in the 80th minute and they held out for the win despite a late strike from prolific Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a fifth straight win for Chelsea, who look increasingly like being Liverpool's main challengers this season, with Arsenal and City faltering. (AFP)

    Haughey claims 5th world title with 200m freestyle win

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday posted the third-fastest time ever recorded for the women’s 200-metre freestyle event, clocking in a time of one minute and 50.62 seconds to capture gold at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, finished nearly a second faster than Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey, who clocked in a time of one minute and 51.49 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Claire Weinstein rounded out the podium to take bronze with her one-minute-51.62 second performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey's result stands just behind only her world record, set in 2021 in Abu Dhabi, and Swedish Sarah Sjostrom‘s one minute and 50.43 from 2017. She now owns four of the five fastest times in event history.
  <br>
  <br>
  With that result, the four-time Olympic medallist for the SAR now has four 200-metre freestyle world crowns – along with one other in the 100-metre event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey had recently announced she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

    Liverpool draw against Fulham; Arsenal stutter

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<img alt="Joel Embiid (21) drives for a shot past Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783507_1_20241214203457.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England were placed in a group with Serbia as the draw for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Europe took place on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  As they prepare to begin life under new coach Thomas Tuchel, England were also drawn alongside Albania, Latvia and Andorra in the five-team Group K.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matches will take place between March and November next year, with the group winners qualifying directly for the World Cup in North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runners-up in each of the 12 qualifying groups will get a second chance via a series of play-offs, with Europe now contributing a total of 16 nations to the expanded 48-team competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  The exact make-up of the groups is not yet completely clear as it depends on the outcome of the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals next March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those ties will see reigning European champions Spain face the Netherlands, while Germany play Italy, Portugal take on Denmark and France meet Croatia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The groups in which these teams end up depend on whether they win and progress to the Nations League semi-finals next June, or are eliminated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are six groups of five teams who will begin qualifying in March, while the six groups of four teams will only start next September. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton stars Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet on Friday crashed out of the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou, falling to the national team's Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin in three games.
 <br>
  <br>
  That result could be the end of the road for the SAR pair, with Tse having already hinted at retirement earlier this year as she continues to battle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei pulled ahead late to win the opening game, 21-16.
  <br>
  <br>
  It didn't take long for Tang and Tse to bounce back, though, claiming a nail-biting 21-19 victory in the second to force a winner-take-all third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Down by six at the break, the SAR pair put up a fight by scoring six straight points to cut the deficit at 14-11.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jiang and Wei pulled away to seal a 21-15 victory to round out the 63 minute match-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong duo finished group play with one win and two losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei will join compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong in the knockout round, which begins on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju became the youngest chess world champion on Thursday after beating defending champion Ding Liren of China in the final match of their series in Singapore.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju, 18, secured 7.5 points against 6.5 of his Chinese rival in the contest, surpassing the achievement of Russia’s Garry Kasparov who won the title at the age of 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Indian teen prodigy has long been considered a rising star in the chess world after he became a chess grandmaster at 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  He had entered the match as the youngest-ever challenger to the world crown after winning the Candidates tournament earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  After securing victory, Dommaraju burst into tears and raised his arms in celebration.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I was dreaming this moment for the last 10 years. I am happy that I realised the dream (and made it) into reality,” he told reporters after his win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dommaraju is now the second Indian to win the title after five-time world chess champion Viswanathan Anand.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s a proud moment for chess, a proud moment for India... and for me, a very personal moment of pride,” Anand, who has been a mentor to Dommaraju, said in a post on X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the 18-year-old on his “remarkable accomplishment,” calling it “the result of his unparalleled talent, hard work and unwavering determination.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday’s match was a 14-round long-time classical event with a prize fund of US$2.5 million. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former China men's national football team coach Li Tie has been jailed for 20 years, state media reported on Friday, following a lengthy trial on corruption charges.
 <br>
  <br>
  Li, who used to play for English side Everton, "was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years at an initial trial" at a court in Hubei province, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has waged a sweeping crackdown against official corruption since coming to power over a decade ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anti-graft authorities took aim at the sport industry towards the end of 2022 and have announced a string of convictions for former football administrators this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li, who was China's coach from January 2020 until December 2021, pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting over US$10 million in bribes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 47-year-old is one of China's most recognisable former footballers and notably played as a midfielder with Premier League side Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  He featured in a documentary aired by state broadcaster CCTV in January about widespread corruption in Chinese football.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the programme, Li said he had arranged nearly US$421,000 in bribes to secure the head coach position, and helped to fix matches when he was a club coach in the Chinese Super League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very sorry. I should have kept my head to the ground and followed the right path," said Li during the show.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were certain things that at the time were common practices in football." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City captain Kyle Walker has called for tough action to tackle online abuse after he received a "vile, racist and threatening" message following Wednesday's 2-0 loss at Juventus.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walker played the whole European Champions League match in Turin but could not help Pep Guardiola's team avoid a seventh defeat in 10 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international posted a screenshot of a message he received on Instagram from an unnamed user to his social media accounts on Thursday that used obscene racist language.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one should ever be subjected to the sort of vile, racist and threatening abuse I have received online since last night's match," Walker wrote on his X and Instagram accounts.

  "Instagram and the authorities need to stop this happening for the sake of all who are suffering this abuse – it is never acceptable," he went on to say. "To our fans, we will continue to work as a team to do better, to improve and to turn the corner together."
  <br>
  <br>
  City condemned the racist attack. A club statement read: "Manchester City strongly condemns the racist abuse that Kyle Walker was subject to online following last night's fixture.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We refuse to tolerate discrimination of any kind – regardless of whether that be in stadiums or online," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League also weighed in, saying in a statement that "racism has no place in the game or anywhere in society."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage anyone who hears or sees discriminatory abuse to report it so action can be taken," it wrote. "The Premier League will support Kyle Walker and the club to tackle online hate." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rasmus Hojlund fired Manchester United to a 2-1 win at Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League as Chelsea beat Astana 3-1 in the Europa Conference League.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim's United side came from behind to best the Czech side thanks to a second-half brace by Danish striker Hojlund, provisionally moving to fifth in the league phase standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top eight finish will see United qualify automatically for the round of 16, while finishing ninth to 24th will earn them a play-off tie to reach that stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matej Vydra opened the scoring three minutes after half-time to stun United, before substitute Hojlund scored twice in the last half-hour to seize a vital three points for the English club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner came two minutes from time when Bruno Fernandes cleverly slipped a free-kick into the 21-year-old's feet and he held off a defender before slipping home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere in the Europa League, Roma beat 10-man Braga 3-0 thanks to goals from Lorenzo Pellegrini, Saud Abdulhamid and Mario Hermoso to move to 12th in the standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic Bilbao top the standings with 16 points after beating Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahce 2-0 on Wednesday courtesy of an Inaki Williams double.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, a much-changed Chelsea side battled the frigid conditions in Kazakhstan and won to all but guarantee a top-eight finish in the league phase, which would ensure automatic qualification to the round of 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a solid performance," Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca. "We knew it was quite cold – we tried to adapt quickly. The players did fantastically with the weather conditions and long journey."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea sit top of the standings on 15 points, three ahead of Fiorentina in second and Legia Warsaw who lost to Switzerland's Lugano to break their perfect record in the competition. (AFP)

 Swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Friday finished fourth in the final of the 100-metre freestyle event at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong swimmer finished her two laps with a time of 51.41 seconds, more than a full second behind first-place American Gretchen Walsh who took gold with a 50.31-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beryl Gastaldello of France clocked in a time of 50.63 seconds for the silver medal, while 14-time Championships medallist Kate Douglass claimed bronze at 50.73 seconds.

  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Haughey is the 200-metre freestyle on Sunday, where she will be looking to defend her title as she competes in what will be one of her last races before going on hiatus.

<img alt="Chloe Chan says she is excited about leading the team in their coming campaigns. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783168_2_20241212162516.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The captain of Hong Kong, China men's team, James Christie, on Thursday said the squad would be looking to build on their recent success in Asia as they enter the final stretch of training in the run-up to the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens tournament in March.
 <br>
  <br>
  Having been named as the successor to Max Woodward in September, Christie weighed in on what the opportunity to lead Hong Kong meant to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've always said I'm not much of a talker," Christie said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not much difference between being a player and a captain – I need to lead from the front a bit more, but I like to lead through the games and matches that I play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Christie, 28, has already tasted early success in leading the SAR to a clean sweep of victories during the Asia Rugby Sevens Series this autumn.
  <br>
  <br>
  In November, the SAR defeated Japan in the final of the last leg of the tournament in Thailand, repeating its earlier successes in China and South Korea, to become the first side to win all of its 15 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Christie said the team's eyes are on the bigger prize on home soil, as the annual tournament makes its debut at the Kai Tak Sports Park for the first time next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge motivation, the new facilities look fantastic," said Christie.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just looking forward to running out a new spot with a new team and new faces, so hopefully, it'll be all good."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also added that fitness, skills, and cohesion are major aspects that the team are looking to polish up on ahead of the Sevens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chloe Chan, the new co-captain of the women's side, said she wants to encourage her teammates on and off the field, to ensure that the team bonds well together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I really want our team to come together and perform and do well in the Challenger Series," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for veteran co-captain Natasha Olson-Thorne, she said she's looking forward to working with a new partner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chloe Chan has actually been on the leadership group for quite a while, so she has stepped up. She's been a leader multiple times before, so I see it going quite smoothly," Olson-Thorne told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She's got a lot of experience and a lot of positivity leading into the team environment."

 The Houston Rockets edged Golden State 91-90 for their first win over the Warriors since 2020, as they reach the semi-finals of the NBA Cup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teammate Jalen Green's 12 points, including the game-winning free-throws with 3.5 seconds remaining, helped Houston end a run of 15 straight losses to the Warriors stretching back to February 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Rockets booked an NBA Cup last-four showdown against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Las Vegas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Atlanta Hawks, fueled by 22 points and 11 assists from Trae Young, erased a 10-point third-quarter deficit to beat the New York Knicks 108-100 and book an NBA Cup semi-final against the Milwaukee Bucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hawks point guard Young, the player Knicks fans have loved to hate since Atlanta's 2021 playoff series triumph over New York, came alive in the second half to get the Hawks offense firing after the Knicks dominated the first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  He scored 12 points and handed out nine assists after the break, directing a balanced Hawks attack that was led by 24 points from forward De'Andre Hunter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a big game, especially for us," Young said after the Hawks punched their ticket to the NBA Cup final four.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just try to play for each other and play til the end, and that's what we did." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR's star badminton pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet lost on Thursday at the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou.
 <br>
  <br>
  The national team's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, gold medallists at the Paris Olympics in the summer, came from a game down to beat Tang and Tse 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong, China pair took the first game with ease by the score of 21-14.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was tight in the second game before Zheng and Huang finished with a 6-0 run to win 21-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both teams exchanged runs in the nail-biting decider, with Tang and Tse going on a 6-1 rally to take an 11-6 advantage into intermission.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China duo bounced back with a 4-0 run of their own, before the SAR pair took a 15-11 lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Zheng and Huang took control from then on, winning 21-18, to the delight of the Hangzhou crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris gold medallists are playing in their final tournament after Zheng announced his retirement from international competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for Tang and Tse, they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin from the national team in their final group match on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiang and Wei have won both their matches, the SAR pair and Zheng and Huang are both 1-1, and the Chinese Taipei pair of Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang are 0-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs advance to the knockout stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  This could be the final tournament for the Hong Kong pair, after Tse indicated earlier she's pondering her future after battling a spate of injuries.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifa on Wednesday confirmed that Saudi Arabia will host the 2034 World Cup, underlining the Gulf kingdom's growing influence in world sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, a virtual Congress of world football's governing body confirmed that Morocco, Spain and Portugal will be joint hosts of the 2030 World Cup, in which three games will also be played in South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Saudi bid was waved through by acclamation during the meeting of Fifa's 211 national member associations, with no rivals standing in its way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a proud day, a day of celebration, a day that we invite the entire world to Saudi Arabia," said Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Faisal al Saud, the Saudi Minister of Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We intend to have an extraordinary version of the World Cup in our kingdom."
  <br>
  <br>
  Responding to condemnation from rights groups, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said his organisation is inclusive and non-discriminatory. “We want to obtain positive social impact," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are of course aware of critics and fears, and I fully trust our hosts to address all open points from this process and deliver a Fifa World Cup which meets expectations."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "social improvements and positive human rights impacts" are "responsibilities of hosting a World Cup". (AFP)

  "It was really emotional," said Pachuca coach Guillermo Almada. "It was a party in the stadium with all the supporters from Pachuca and Botafogo that came here – it was a football party."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very happy," he added. "We're already thinking about the next game, which could be even more difficult than this one."
  <br>
  <br>
  The winners of the all-American clash progress to the next round of the new Intercontinental Cup format, where they will meet CAF Champions League winners Al Ahly of Egypt on December 14.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid, the current Uefa Champions League holders, lie in wait in the final four days later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pachuca qualified for the tournament as victors of the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup – following their 3-0 win in the final against MLS side Columbus Crew in early June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat put a dampener on a brilliant fortnight for Botafogo in which they won the Copa Libertadores and wrapped up the Brazilian Serie A.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I won't look for an excuse," said Botafogo coach Artur Jorge. "Pachuca were better than us, more efficient and more capable in the second half."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 52-year-old Portuguese guided the Rio club to a first-ever Copa Libertadores and a first domestic league title since 1995 this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't the result we wanted, but we had an extraordinary year, made history," he added. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka's double fired Arsenal a step closer to the Champions League last 16 as the England forward inspired a 3-0 win against Monaco on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Saka netted late in each half and Kai Havertz struck in the closing minutes at the Emirates Stadium to lift Mikel Arteta's side into third place in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners have won four of their six European games this term and, with two matches remaining, they control their destiny in the race for the top-eight finish that guarantees automatic progress to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clubs that finish ninth to 24th in the 36-team first phase face a play-off to determine if they will advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  With games against Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come in January, the north Londoners will be confident of avoiding that unwanted obstacle.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a damaging 1-1 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Arsenal's fifth win in their last six games in all competitions was a welcome tonic.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Arsenal's defensive injury crisis showing no signs of abating, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ben White, Riccardo Calafiori, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Takehiro Tomiyasu were all absent.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey started out of position at right-back despite missing training on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly, 18, came in at left-back for just his second Arsenal start, with his other coming in the League Cup against third-tier Bolton.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngest player to start a Champions League match for Arsenal since Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011, Lewis-Skelly rose to the occasion with a composed display.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Gabriel Jesus has gone 32 games without a goal for Arsenal and the Brazilian's lack of confidence was clear in the hosts' first dangerous attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Picked out by Gabriel Martinelli's pass, Jesus should have hit the target but could only muster a tame shot straight at Monaco keeper Radoslaw Majecki.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus failed to time his run well enough to reach Mikel Merino's teasing cross moments later. (AFP)

    Man City crisis deepens with defeat at Juventus

<img alt="Manchester City's Erling Braut Haland (right) at the end of the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783110_1_20241212072102.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were plunged further into crisis on Wednesday after falling to a 2-0 defeat at Juventus which threatens their chances of reaching the last 16.
 <br>
  <br>
  Second-half goals from Dusan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie were enough for Juve to inflict a seventh defeat in 10 matches on Pep Guardiola's struggling City.
  <br>
  <br>
  English champions City languish in 22nd place in Europe's top club competition, having collected just eight points from their six matches in the revamped league phase.
  <br>
  <br>
  That leaves City just one point above the bottom 12 places and elimination, with matches against Paris Saint-Germain and Club Brugge remaining, a position that would have been unthinkable at the start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But City have unravelled in less than six weeks and are way off the pace both in the Premier League and Champions League thanks to just one win, over Nottingham Forest, since the end of October.
  <br>
  <br>
  City now have the Manchester derby at the weekend, hardly the sort of fixture they need in the midst of this dismal run from.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to get points, we'll go to Paris to try and do that and the same goes for the final match at home," said Guardiola to Amazon Prime in Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can get out of this period by playing like we did today. We lost very few balls and I think we played very well... they deserve more because they give everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vlahovic's header, his 10th goal of the season, and substitute McKennie's fine volley with 15 minutes remaining also snapped a frustrating four-match run of draws for Juventus and brightened the mood among fans who have been disappointed with Thiago Motta's opening few months as coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve had drawn 11 of their 20 matches in all competitions coming into Wednesday's match, but a rugged display moved them up to 11 points and ended with fans roaring with joy and colouring the stands of the Allianz Stadium with flag waving.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motta's team are level with fellow Serie A outfit Atalanta and two points from the top eight positions which give direct access to the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was little suggestion of Juve grabbing such a big result after a very drab opening period in frigid Turin, where two off-form teams ineffectually bumped up against one another.
  <br>
  <br>
  The best chance of the half came five minutes before the break when Michele Di Gregorio did well to charge down Erling Haaland as the Norway striker tried to flick home Kevin De Bruyne's neat through ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juve produced even less in front in increasingly frustrated supporters, who only had a Kenan Yildiz pot shot to shout about in a largely dismal opening period for the hosts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, that all changed in the 53rd minute thanks to Vlahovic just about forcing his close-range header across the line after City goalkeeper Ederson had kept out Federico Gatti's flying volley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stunned into action, City pushed for a leveller as Juve retreated into their own box, a move reminiscent of dozens of similarly dogged Italian defensive displays.
  <br>
  <br>
  Di Gregorio did brilliantly to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's powerful long-range effort in the 68th minute, seconds before McKennie came on for Khephren Thuram.
  <br>
  <br>
  The American turned out to be an inspired choice as he was on hand, completely unmarked, to lash in countryman Timothy Weah's deftly clipped cross and kill off City's hopes of saving a point. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's superstar swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Wednesday advanced to the 100m freestyle semi-finals at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest, in one of her last races before taking a break to ponder her future.
 <br>
  <br>
  Her time of 52.12 seconds topped her heat, and was good for second overall behind American Gretchen Walsh, who clocked a 51.64-second finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, was second at the first turn in the short course race and overtook Briton Freya Andersen shortly afterwards.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow SAR swimmer Li Sum-yiu, 15, was unable to advance after finishing eighth in the same heat with a time of 53.41 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The semi-finals are due to begin at 0:48am on Thursday, Hong Kong time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey will also be looking to defend her 200m freestyle title in Hungary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four-time Olympic medallist for Hong Kong, China recently announced that she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet from the SAR began their final tournament of the year on a high, defeating a pair from Chinese Taipei in straight sets in the World Tour Finals in Hangzhou on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was a strong performance for the long-time Hong Kong, China mixed doubles duo from start to finish, after they made it to the year-end finals for the fourth time in their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annual showcase could very well be their last as Tse, 33, who has battled a host of injuries in recent years, said earlier she has been contemplating her future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pair dispatched Yang Po-Hsuan and Hu Ling-fang in 39 minutes to take the first match in Group A, which has been described as a group of death.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tang and Tse set the tone early to claim the first game, 21-15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese Taipei pair put up a fight in the second match, though, drawing level at 17 before dropping the last four points and losing the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Tour Finals is a year-end showcase for those ranked in the top-eight in the world in eligible tournaments, with each country or region limited to sending two entries for each event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Up next for Tang and Tse are Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong from the national team on Thursday, before they face top-seeded Jiang Zhenbang and Wei Yaxin, also from the national team, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the top two pairs in each group qualify for a spot in the knockout stage, which will take place on Saturday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid got their European Champions League title defence back up and running after coming through a tough battle to win 3-2 at Atalanta.
 <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Kylian Mbappé, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham were just enough for Madrid to triumph in a red-hot atmosphere in Bergamo and move up to nine points from six matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's side would have been at risk of dropping out of the play-off places but came through a tough test at Serie A leaders Atalanta.
  <br>
  <br>
  The away side are now three points from the top eight positions which give direct qualification for the last 16 with two matches remaining in their league campaign and a round of fixtures coming up on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid inflicted on Atalanta a first defeat in this year's revamped competition and are now only two points behind Gian Piero Gasperini's ambitious team who performed well against 15-time European champions Madrid but now sit ninth.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously we're a little disappointed, but we're learning so much from these matches," Gasperini said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing tiny details, but we played with heart against great champions," he added. "We were defeated in result, but not in performance."
  <br>
  <br>
  Atalanta scored through a Charles De Ketelaere penalty which levelled Mbappé's opener in first-half stoppage time and a fine Ademola Lookman strike in the 65th minute which put the hosts back in the match after Vinicius and Bellingham's quickfire goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts even came to within inches of snatching a dramatic draw deep in added time when substitute Retegui somehow shot over Lookman's fizzing cross from from practically on the goalline. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 European Champions League group phase leaders Liverpool virtually sealed a place in the last 16 with a tight 1-0 victory at Girona after Mohamed Salah struck from the penalty spot.
 <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool have made a stunning start in the competition under coach Arne Slot, winning all six of their matches to move provisionally five points clear of second-placed Inter Milan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The English giants, six-time winners of the competition, were given a tough night by Champions League debutants Girona, who fell to a fifth defeat and are on the verge of elimination.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teams finishing in the top eight will avoid an extra round of play-off matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me about all six games, I'm really pleased with all the results – but I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight," Slot told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had hardly any control at all over the game, maybe the second half was a bit better but then I'm trying to be positive."
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot started fit-again goalkeeper Alisson Becker after a two-month injury lay-off and the Brazilian showed no sign of rust on a busy night.
  <br>
  <br>
  After their Merseyside derby clash at Everton was called off because of a storm at the weekend, Slot was able to pick a fresh side, going with arguably his strongest available team to try and assure a top eight finish as soon as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcomers Girona, who lost several key players in the summer and are still rebuilding, opted for Arnaut Danjuma in attack with support from spritely duo Bryan Gil and Yaser Asprilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool pinned the hosts back in the first 10 minutes and Girona stopper Paulo Gazzaniga pushed away a Joe Gomez header.
  <br>
  <br>
  After that Michel Sanchez's Girona found their footing on a chilly night at their sold-out Montilivi stadium, reduced to under 10,000 capacity due to UEFA regulations, and they began to put Alisson to the test. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jarrod Bowen eased the pressure on West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui as his superb strike sealed a vital 2-1 win that pushed Wolves manager Gary O'Neil closer to the sack on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a showdown dubbed "El Sackico" due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the futures of Lopetegui and O'Neil, it was the Hammers chief who earned some much-needed breathing space thanks to Bowen's moment of magic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bowen bagged a priceless winner in the second half at the London Stadium, just moments after Wolves defender Matt Doherty had cancelled out Tomas Soucek's opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham's first win in three games lifted them nine points clear of the relegation zone, while second bottom Wolves remain four points adrift of safety after their 10th defeat in 15 league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the aftermath of last week's 3-1 loss at Leicester, Lopetegui was reported to have survived a board meeting about his position.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard, who replaced David Moyes in the close-season, must build on this valuable victory over the team he managed in the 2022-23 season before he can fully relax.

  "I don't talk about noise, I talk about football. If you ask me about football, I will. A win is always good for me," Lopetegui said. "The fans have supported us a lot through the bad times. I'm happy for them."
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil, who played for West Ham from 2011 to 2013, heard Wolves fans call for his dismissal during their 4-0 thrashing at Everton on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Now he will anxiously await the verdict from the Wolves board on his future, which looks bleak after the latest blow to Wolves' survival hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "An awful lot of decisions went against us in a big game, big moments. You need some of them to go your way but they didn't," O'Neil said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not concerned," he added. "People above me are supportive, but the supporters want to be successful – I understand I have to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham were rocked at the weekend by the news that their Jamaica striker Michail Antonio had been in a serious car crash that left him needing surgery on a lower limb fracture.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 34-year-old had to be cut out of his Ferrari following the accident, with Lopetegui admitting it was a "miracle" he survived.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't an easy week. We dedicate the victory to Michail," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hammers fans held a minute's applause for Antonio in the ninth minute to match his shirt number. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China men's football team will kick off the final round of their campaign for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup when they travel to Singapore in March following Monday’s draw for qualification to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR were drawn in Group C, which also features India and Bangladesh. Only the winners from each of the six groups earn a spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong will begin their qualifying campaign by playing Singapore away on March 25, and India on June 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  These qualifiers will be the final chance for 24 teams to secure the final six spots, with the SAR being drawn in a tight and extremely competitive group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore are currently ranked 161 in the world, and are also gearing up to take on Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Timor-Leste in the Asean Championships being played across Southeast Asia this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, India – who qualified for the 2023 edition of the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar but finished bottom of their group – are ranked 127th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bangladesh, ranked 185th, has also shown rapid improvement in their level of play in recent times.

<img alt="Neuer during Bayern Munich's German Cup match against Bayer Leverkusen. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782800_1_20241210090342.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer will likely not play again in 2024, coach Vincent Kompany said ahead of Tuesday's clash with Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "He's got a broken rib, which means he probably won't play again this year," Kompany said. "What's important is that it heals now – hopefully from the start of January we'll have him back, but for now it's too early."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kompany confirmed Neuer broke his rib in a collision with Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong on Tuesday, for which the goalie also picked up the first red card of his 866-game career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern are missing several first-team players as an injury crisis sweeps through the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer, Harry Kane, Kingsley Coman, Alphonso Davies, Joao Palhinha, Serge Gnabry, Josip Stanisic, Hiroki Ito and Mathys Tel are all on the injured list, while back-up 'keeper Sven Ulreich is out for personal reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're missing a lot of players, but I think we've come through well so far," Kompany said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's absence means Bayern's third-choice goalie, Daniel Peretz, will start between the sticks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Israel goalkeeper will play his third game for Bayern having made his club debut off the bench after Neuer's sending off in the 1-0 German Cup last 16 loss to Leverkusen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The six-time Champions League winners sit in 13th spot on the Champions League table after five matches, after three home wins and away losses to Barcelona and Aston Villa.
  <br>
  <br>
  A win against Shakhtar would help Bayern's bid to finish in the top eight and avoid an additional playoff round. (AFP)

    Lawmaker urges more flexible sports funding system

<img alt="Lawmaker Kenneth Fok (second right) says if billiard sports are downgraded to Tier B status, it may affect their development. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782725_1_20241209170136.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's sports sector lawmaker has called for more flexibility in the funding system for sports, and not just focus on Olympic and Asian Games participation when determining the city's three-tiered support mechanism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kenneth Fok, who represents the sports, performing arts, culture and publication sector, said on Monday the global sports scene was evolving with events coming in and out in top-level international competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Are we just chasing Olympic and Asian Games medals or do we want more? Can we actually have our athletes shine in different international arenas and competitions too?" Fok questioned.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The system should allow for more flexibility, instead of just chasing the Olympic and Asian [Games] medals... The whole mechanism is now more rearward-facing. We're looking at past results only. It creates a system where you first get the results, and then you get the reward."
  <br>
  <br>
  Sports in Hong Kong are classified into three levels: Tier A*, Tier A, and Tier B, with those in the top tier like fencing and swimming being identified as ones with the potential to excel at the Olympics and athletes receiving the best resources.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those with a Tier A status are sports with athletes competing in previous Olympics or Asian Games, and are set to continue doing so. Athletes for such sports get funding for training programmes and dedicated coaching, among others.
  <br>
  <br>
  Support for athletes in the remaining tier depends on individual circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  But billiard sports do not meet the criteria of being included in enough Asian and Olympic games between 2010 and 2030, to pass for the Tier A level of support. As it stands, billiard sports are at risk of losing up to 80 percent of current funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lawmaker said the achievements of SAR snooker players should not be disregarded simply because they did not compete in the Olympics and Asian Games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the proven results of cue sports in Hong Kong, in terms of our athletes repeatedly gaining world championship status, that should be part of the equation too," Fok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If [billiard sports] are demoted to Tier B, it will not just send a negative image on government support for cue sports despite their results, but it might also impair the ability...to deliver other objectives besides elite athletes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vincent Law, chairman of the Billiard Sports Council of Hong Kong China, said it could happen as early as April next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our hands are quite tied, because we have no influence on the policy-making part... But we, and our athletes, will keep doing our job, and we won't waste the resources that the government has given us," Law said.

 Hong Kong, China on Sunday defeated Romania 8-2 to take bronze at the International Table Tennis Federation Mixed Team World Cup in Chengdu, as Team China successfully defended their title.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng Wing-lam and Yiu Kwan-to handed the SAR the perfect start, after claiming all three games in their mixed doubles showdown over Elizabeta Samara and Ovidiu Ionescu by a final scoreline of 11-3, 11-6, 11-9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting, who were paired during the Paris Olympics in July, defeated Bernadette Szocs and Eduard Ionescu in back-to-back showings to put the SAR within one game of claiming the bronze medal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong and Yiu rounded out the evening with an 11-4 win against Darius Movileanu and Ionescu to secure the prize.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Team China, successfully retained their title after recording an 8-1 win over South Korea in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  That result gave the national team a clean sweep of the tournament, having won all 10 matches leading up to the final.

    Soto to sign with New York Mets on record 15-year deal

<img alt="Soto during match against the New York Mets at Citi Field. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782686_1_20241209121559.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Dominican baseball superstar Juan Soto has agreed to join the New York Mets on a record-breaking 15-year, US$765 million deal, multiple US media reports said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  ESPN and Major League Baseball's official website both reported Soto's blockbuster move, which if confirmed would be the richest contract in the history of North American professional sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  Soto had entered free agency after playing last season for the New York Yankees, who had hoped to re-sign the gifted 26-year-old outfielder.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal reported on Sunday eclipses the US$700 million, 10-year contract the Los Angeles Dodgers signed with Japanese star Shohei Ohtani last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN reported that Soto's Mets contract could eventually be worth more than US$800 million if certain benchmarks were met.
  <br>
  <br>
  The guessing game over Soto's likely next destination had dominated baseball's rumor mill since the Yankees were beaten 4-1 by the Dodgers in the World Series in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Yankees had mounted a concerted effort to re-sign Soto, who blasted 41 home runs and amassed 166 hits for the Bronx Bombers last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Yankees were just one of several teams actively pursuing the explosive slugger, with the Mets and the Boston Red Sox amongst the teams who met with Soto's representatives to discuss a possible deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets, however, won the race for Soto after a season in which they made a giant-killing playoff run to the National League Championship Series, where they eventually lost to the Dodgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Mets will be the fourth team of Soto's relatively short career.
  <br>
  <br>
  He exploded onto the Major League Baseball scene during his first full season in 2019, helping the Washington Nationals score an upset World Series victory over the Houston Astros.
  <br>
  <br>
  He rejected a 15-year, US$440 million offer to stay with the Nationals in 2022, and was eventually traded to the San Diego Padres in August of that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Soto failed to settle in San Diego and headed back to the east coast in December 2023 in a trade that took him to the Yankees. (AFP)

    Jokić erupts as Denver rout Hawks, Heat stun Cavs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nikola Jokić produced another dazzling high-scoring performance with a 48-point masterpice as the Denver Nuggets crushed the Atlanta Hawks 141-111 on the road on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Jokić – who scored a career-high 56 points in vain during a defeat to Washington on Saturday – was nearly unplayable in a dominant display that included 14 rebounds, eight assists and three steals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Porter Jr. added 26 points for Denver while Christian Braun finished with 17 and Julian Strawther 13 in a wire-to-wire blowout against an Atlanta outfit who had gone into the contest on a six-game winning streak.
  <br>
  <br>
  Denver coach Michael Malone was left purring with pleasure at Jokić's performance, describing the opportunity to coach the Serbian superstar as a privilege.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't say I'm surprised because I've been spoiled by having the best seat in the house to watch this guy for 10 years, to watch him do it night-in, night-out," Malone said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As much as we put on his shoulders, he never runs from it, never complains," he added. "I love his mental toughness and physical toughness. I feel privileged to have the chance to coach him – I never take it for granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  Malone meanwhile was satisfied with a victory that lifts Denver to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a response that was needed," Malone said. "There's some stuff we can clean up, but we needed a win and we got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other games on Sunday, Tyler Herro scored 34 points as the Miami Heat sent the Cleveland Cavaliers crashing to only their fourth defeat of the season with a 122-113 victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro drained five three-pointers and was a perfect nine-from-nine from the free throw line to spearhead a third straight victory for in-form Miami.
  <br>
  <br>
  Herro was backed with 23 points from Duncan Robinson while Jimmy Butler added 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bam Adebayo also played a huge part in the victory with 16 points, 13 rebounds and six assists as Miami improved to 12-10 for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland meanwhile saw seven players finish in double figures, with Darius Garland leading the scoring with 23 points, five rebounds and five assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  A disappointing loss for Cleveland was exacerbated by an injury to Evan Mobley who suffered a right ankle sprain that left him able to play only for 11min 46sec.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a bad one," Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said of Mobley's injury, revealing the forward had initially sought to play through the knock.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's a tough kid," Atkinson said. "It's unfortunate for us." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Antoine Griezmann struck a 94th-minute winner to snatch Atlético Madrid a thrilling 4-3 victory over Sevilla on Sunday in La Liga.
 <br>
  <br>
  Diego Simeone's side, third, have won nine matches straight across all competitions and the win pulled them a point behind second-placed title holders Real Madrid and three behind leaders Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético showed character and quality as they fought back from two goals down in the second half to triumph.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo De Paul powered Atlético ahead but Dodi Lukebakio equalised for 13th-placed Sevilla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero sent the visitors ahead after half-an-hour and Juanlu Sánchez gave them a 3-1 lead before the hour mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Griezmann pegged one back before substitute Samuel Lino scored a stunning effort from the edge of the box and the Frenchman then blasted home in stoppage time to continue Atlético's superb run of form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lukebakio gave the ball away for De Paul's opener as he tried to dribble out of a dangerous area.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Argentine midfielder lashed the ball beyond the reach of Sevilla goalkeeper Álvaro Fernández from the edge of the box in the 10th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  However the Andalusians were quickly on level terms, with Lukebakio making amends two minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian forward, on the left of Atlético's area, took one step to beat his marker and smashed home at the near post, catching out Jan Oblak with his powerful strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla played with huge intensity, pressing Atletico and throwing themselves into tackles, up for the fight at the Metropolitano stadium in front of over 60,000 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took the lead in the 32nd minute when Romero broke in behind to reach Kike Salas' pass to net his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The striker fired past Oblak, who got a hand to his effort but could not keep the ball out.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts battled hard to find a way back in but Francisco Garcia Pimienta's Sevilla soaked up the pressure and netted their third early in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  They put together an excellent team move, involving Lukebakio, Djibril Sow and Salas, the latter of whom crossed for Sánchez to slam home at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were unperturbed and swiftly pulled one back through Griezmann, after an excellent through-ball from Spanish midfielder Pablo Barrios.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla goalkeeper Fernández made several good saves as the Rojiblancos pushed for an equaliser, denying substitute Alexander Sorloth twice, and the Norwegian striker narrowly missed a tempting cross with a diving header.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético pulled level thanks to Lino's spectacular strike from distance, which was reward for their heavy pressure in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sevilla were under the cosh in the final stages and eventually caved when Griezmann swivelled and smashed the winner past the helpless Fernández. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea roared back from two goals down to beat Tottenham 4-3 on Sunday, moving just four points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool after Arsenal were held by Fulham.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Gunners and Chelsea both started the day seven points adrift of Arne Slot's side, whose game this weekend was postponed due to stormy weather.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were forced to settle for a 1-1 draw but Enzo Maresca's Chelsea, kicking off later Sunday, mounted a stunning comeback at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski put Spurs two goals up inside 11 minutes but Jadon Sancho quickly pulled one back with a fine strike and the second half belonged to the visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cole Palmer equalised from the penalty spot in the 61st minute and Enzo Fernandez put Chelsea ahead 12 minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's ice-cool "Panenka" spot-kick gave the visitors a two-goal cushion before Son Heung-min added a late third for Spurs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Second-placed Chelsea now have 31 points after 15 games, two points ahead of London rivals Arsenal. Liverpool, with a game in hand, are on 35 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The plan or the idea is to not let the players slow down," Maresca told Sky Sports. "They cannot drop because they know another player is waiting to come in."
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Italian, in his first season at Stamford Bridge, played down his team's title chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool probably don't slide like what Cucurella did," he added. "To be serious, we are not ready – we are far from these teams, but we focus on day-by-day and trying to improve the team."
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat is a disastrous result for under-pressure Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, whose side hammered champions Manchester City 4-0 just two weeks ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a sore one, a painful one," said the Australian, whose team are now 11th in the Premier League table after their seventh defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Bukayo Saka had a late winner ruled out for offside by a VAR review as the Gunners' four-match winning streak was halted in west London.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raúl Jiménez fired Fulham into an early lead before William Saliba levelled after yet another Arsenal goal from a corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are very disappointed not to win the game – overall we absolutely dominated the game from start to end," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did all the things that we wanted to do during the game and unfortunately we concede one goal in one shot. The way the team played, the way the team wanted to win, it was unbelievable."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were still without influential defensive pair Gabriel Magalhães and Riccardo Calafiori through injury and Fulham exposed a makeshift left side of the Gunners' backline to take the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal underlined their threat from set-pieces when they scored twice from corners to beat Manchester United 2-0 in midweek. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR’s footballers on Sunday began their quest to make the final of an East Asian tournament with a dominant 3-0 victory over Mongolia at the Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China were in control from start to finish of the opener of the qualifying round of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Championship – in what was their fourth consecutive victory under coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Star winger Everton Camargo and midfielder Wong Wai each scored a goal for the home side before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the break, winger Nicholas Benavides came out to score his first goal for the SAR in only his second game by heading home a cross from substitute Mahama Awal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper and captain Edmond Yapp earned his 100th cap for Hong Kong, China, the first player from the SAR to reach the century mark.
  <br>
  <br>
  The football association marked the occasion by presenting him with a commemorative kit, to the delight of more than 3,300 spectators.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR will play against Chinese Taipei on Saturday in another Group B match.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam and Macau are the two remaining teams in Group A, after North Korea withdrew from the competition last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two teams topping their respective groups will play in the final on 17 December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

    Vissel Kobe win the J. League for domestic double

<img alt="Members of Vissel Kobe celebrate with the title cup following their victory. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782620_1_20241208191040.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's Vissel Kobe won on the final day of the season on Sunday to seal their second straight J. League title and complete a domestic double.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kobe, who lifted the Emperor's Cup two weeks ago, started the day one point ahead of nearest challengers Sanfrecce Hiroshima and sealed the deal with a dominant 3-0 win at home to Shonan Bellmare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima crashed 3-1 to Gamba Osaka while third-placed Machida Zelvia, who went into the final day with a slim chance of winning the title in their first season in the top flight, lost 3-1 to Kashima Antlers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe are also on course to qualify from the league stage of the Asian Champions League as they chase an unprecedented treble.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've played a lot of games this season and that's thanks to everyone in the team," said coach Takayuki Yoshida.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've won two titles and we're progressing well in the Asian Champions League. I appreciate the hard work of everyone in the team, all the players and staff."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe won the J. League for the first time last season, almost five months after Spanish legend Andres Iniesta left the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  The former Barcelona star spent five years in Kobe and played alongside two other World Cup winners in Spain's David Villa and Germany's Lukas Podolski.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of Kobe's high-profile overseas players have since departed and the club have found success through former Japan internationals such as Yoshinori Muto, once of Newcastle United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All the players have given 100 percent in games and in training," said Muto, who scored 13 goals for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The strong point of our team is that everyone is willing to take responsibility."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kobe lined up against lowly Shonan knowing that a win would guarantee them a second title, and Taisei Miyashiro put them in front in the 26th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto forced a save from Shonan goalkeeper Naoto Kamifukumoto with a powerful header and Miyashiro swept home the rebound from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Muto made it two just minutes before half time, finishing off a fast break.
  <br>
  <br>
  Takahiro Ogihara put the icing on the cake with a stunning long-range effort in the 70th minute, his first goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hiroshima, led by German coach Michael Skibbe, started the day with a better goal difference than Kobe but they conceded early against Gamba and never recovered.
  <br>
  <br>
  Machida had only a mathematical chance of winning the title just over a decade after being in non-league football. (AFP)

    HK Streetathon ends with some going the extra mile

<img alt="The Hong Kong Streetathon featured a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, a cross-harbour half marathon, and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782615_1_20241208180257.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly 17,000 runners took part in this year's Hong Kong Streetathon on Sunday, but some unintentionally went further than the standard distance during one of the races.
 <br>
  <br>
  The full marathon around Victoria Harbour kicked off the races early this morning under chilly weather, as temperatures dipped to their lowest so far this winter at 16 degrees Celsius.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day also featured a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race from Tseung Kwan O to Kwun Tong.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first time, local delicacies were dished out to runners as part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon".
  <br>
  <br>
  Music and fragrance diffusers also featured along parts of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tiffany, a 10km race participant, said she was delighted there was poon choi, a communal dish of foods served in layers which is often eaten on festive occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There was a band performing along the way to cheer us up, and someone gave me a high-five. There was also something to eat – poon choi with mushrooms. That could give runners a boost," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Patsy, a runner who's visually impaired, the route this time around was a bit different than last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I wanted to challenge myself and see what I was capable of. The most important thing was that I had a guide who took good care of me and encouraged me," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the 21-kilometre half marathon saw some runners go an extra nine kilometres due to unclear instructions.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, who was among those who ran the additional stretch, said he was unable to see where to go during part of the route.
  <br>
  <br>
  “There were traffic cones and a bunch of staff members. We couldn't see any of the signs at all," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If only one or two runners could not see the signs, then it could be their problem. But when you had more than 10 people go the wrong way, would it be an issue with the organisers?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers said they were looking into the incident to see whether there was human error involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almost all of the runners who showed up finished the race, organisers said, with more than 3,000 coming from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four participants were hospitalised, while 110 others suffered minor injuries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 LA Galaxy beat New York Red Bulls 2-1 with goals from Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic to win a record-extending sixth MLS Cup and snap a 10-year championship drought on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The final looked like it would be one-sided when hosts and favourites Galaxy scored twice inside 13 minutes through Paintsil and Joveljic in front of a sun-soaked crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The vaunted Red Bulls defence, who lost Andres Reyes just before the start of the game through illness, initially had no answer to Galaxy's aggressive offence despite playing without key injured midfielder Riqui Puig.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Bulls clawed one back in the 28th when the ball pinballed around in front of goal after a corner before finding Sean Nealis, who fired high past goalkeeper John McCarthy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal immediately changed the tone of the contest as the home side began to play more tentatively and the Red Bulls began to go on the attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both sides had chances in the second half and the Red Bulls battled to force extra time as the final whistle approached but Galaxy held firm as they sealed their first MLS Cup since 2014. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruben Amorim's Manchester United honeymoon is truly over after Nottingham Forest inflicted a second straight Premier League defeat on his side on Saturday while Manchester City stumbled again.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leaders Liverpool maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the table even though their match at Everton was postponed because of storms on Merseyside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford last month after a terrible start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began brightly, with a draw and two wins in his first three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  But reality is starting to bite hard after a 2-0 Premier League defeat at Arsenal in midweek followed by Saturday's chastening 3-2 loss to high-flying Forest, who capitalised on United's defensive blunders.
  <br>
  <br>
  United forward Rasmus Hojlund cancelled out Nikola Milenkovic's early goal at Old Trafford, but Morgan Gibbs-White and Chris Wood put the visitors in charge. Forest kept the home side at bay after Bruno Fernandes pulled one back.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's Andre Onana was embarrassed by a swerving Gibbs-White strike for Forest's second while the goalkeeper, Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs De Ligt all failed to deal with a looping Wood header for the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win lifts Forest to fifth in the Premier League table. United are languishing in 13th spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough game in a tough moment but we have to continue the job," a disappointed Amorim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a long journey. We are improving in some aspects. We have to win games to help us improve the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are in the start of something so big that we pay attention to every detail. We already know it's a big job so we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo said "I'm very proud of the way we work together, build things together, from the owner to everyone else in the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a moment to celebrate. But for me, I'm thinking about (next week's match against) Aston Villa."
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City failed to win for the eighth time in nine games in a 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men had the chance to go second in the table but failed to build on an encouraging 3-0 win over Forest in midweek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz fired the home team ahead early but Erling Haaland's towering header levelled the score.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors started the second half strongly but were hit with a sucker punch when Maxence Lacroix powered home Will Hughes' corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rico Lewis found the top corner to level once more for City, but was then sent off six minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fought incredible. We came back twice," said Guardiola. "We gave everything and we take a point."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-placed City are eight points behind Liverpool and a fifth straight Premier League title is looking increasingly unlikely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The final league derby between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park will be rescheduled after Storm Darragh battered western regions of England with high winds and heavy rain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford enjoy the best home record in the division and made it seven wins from eight games at the Gtech Community Stadium with a thrilling 4-2 victory over Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bryan Mbeumo, who has been linked with a move to the Magpies, opened the scoring with a sensational individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle quickly levelled twice in the first half through Alexander Isak and Harvey Barnes, either side of Yoane Wissa's second for Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  But calamitous defending cost Newcastle in the second period when Nathan Collins prodded home from goalkeeper Mark Flekken's long ball forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Schade then sealed the points for the Bees.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The players are growing, a lot of the players here for a while have taken another step up," said Brentford boss Thomas Frank, whose team are seventh in the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to carry on this home form but some wins on the road would be welcome too."
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 1-0 thanks to Jhon Duran's goal in his first Premier League start of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's postponement means Arsenal and Chelsea have the chance the cut the gap at the top to four points later on Sunday.

 US national champion Amber Glenn stunned three-time world champion Kaori Sakamoto to win women's gold ahead of five Japanese figure skaters at the ISU Grand Prix final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Glenn extended her lead from the short programme in the free skating final in south-eastern France, scoring a total of 212.07 points after two performances which both included her signature triple axel jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The elite six-skater competition included five Japanese skaters with Mone Chiba taking silver with 208.85 points and defending champion Sakamoto bronze with 201.13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sakamoto had not been beaten in a major competition since the 2022 Grand Prix final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Olympic bronze medallist paid for a fall on a triple toeloop which cost her points in the short programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Glenn, 25, who won both her Grand Prix events in Angers, France and China this year, had not won an international event before this season and steps into the spotlight just over a year ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  She becomes the first American woman to win the Grand Prix final, the third major event in the skating calendar after the Olympics and world championships, since Alissa Czisny in 2010.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, German figure skaters Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin successfully defended their pairs title. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending champion Ding Liren and his teenage challenger Gukesh Dommaraju of India remained even on Saturday with only four games to go in their World Chess Championship match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The score is deadlocked at five points each after 10 games in the 14-match series as both agreed to a draw.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each player has won one game apiece, with Ding taking the opening match on November 25 and Guksesh coming back to defeat the champion in game three. The rest ended in draws.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding, 32, gained an early advantage on Saturday playing with the white pieces but the game soon fizzled to a draw as neither player made any inroads after 36 moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the tournament neared the homestretch, both players admitted that each move will be crucial.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the cost of one game is higher than it was maybe ... a few games before," the 18-year-old Gukesh said after the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But my approach and my goal is still the same: to play good games in every single game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding said "there's not so much room to make mistakes" anymore and every loss "will result in a very bad situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  If both remain tied after 14 rounds, the match will move to a tie-breaker, which will be played on December 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ding beat Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi last year to become the world champion in Kazakhstan.
  <br>
  <br>
  At his age, Gukesh is the youngest player in history to compete in the World Championship and he is looking to surpass Garry Kasparov as the youngest undisputed world chess champion. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier League leaders Liverpool's Merseyside derby trip to Everton on Saturday was postponed due to adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Darragh.
 <br>
  <br>
  High winds and heavy rain have battered western parts of the United Kingdom, causing widespread travel disruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, Everton said the fixture had been postponed on safety grounds following a meeting between both clubs, local police and Liverpool City Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whilst we appreciate this will be deeply disappointing for supporters, the safety of fans, staff and players is of paramount importance," Everton's statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fixture will be the final Merseyside derby in the league at Everton's Goodison Park, home to the club since 1892, before they move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool lead the Premier League by seven points after 14 games of the 38-match season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fixtures in England's second tier Championship in Plymouth and Cardiff were postponed on Friday due to a rare red weather warning issued by the MET office, the UK's national weather service, for south-west England and Wales. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai will remain on the Formula One calendar until at least 2030 after a new five-year deal, officials said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai International Circuit hosted its first F1 race 20 years ago and China is seen as a major part of the sport's efforts to increase its fanbase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese GP will be the second round on the 2025 calendar, taking place on March 21-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sport returned to China this year for the first time in five years following the pandemic, with Max Verstappen winning the sprint and the main event.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Shanghai is an incredible city and the racetrack is a wonderful test for our drivers," Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO of Formula 1, said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I am delighted that Formula 1 will continue its successful partnership with the Chinese Grand Prix for a further five years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou Guanyu, a Shanghai native and China's first F1 driver, was a major draw during the race weekend in April but he will be leaving the Sauber team at the end of the season. (AFP)

<img alt="Tottenham's Son Heung-Min on-pitch after the match. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782328_1_20241206074358.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ange Postecoglou slammed Tottenham's flops as furious fans turned on the Australian and his spluttering side after Bournemouth condemned them to a shock 1-0 defeat on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dean Huijsen netted in the first half at the Vitality Stadium to leave Postecoglou's troubled team with just one win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old defender's first goal in English football after his close-season move from Juventus exposed the flaws in Tottenham's error-prone defence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacklustre Tottenham were fortunate not to lose by a bigger margin as Andoni Iraola's side wasted several chances to increase their lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's sixth Premier League defeat this season was another setback for the under-fire Postecoglou after last weekend's disappointing 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's not good enough. We again fell into the trap of starting the game really well and then we conceded a really poor goal," Postecoglou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's disappointing – we have this propensity to shoot ourselves in the foot when we should be controlling games," he went on to say. "It's something we've done consistently, and we always pay the price for it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having wasted a golden opportunity to qualify for the Champions League last season, Postecoglou is beginning to hear criticism of his overly-attacking tactics and this dismal display will add to the Australian's doubters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are languishing in 10th place, six points adrift of the top four heading into Sunday's London derby against second-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The fans have every right to be disappointed. I got some pretty direct feedback with the way that we are going at the moment and that is rightly so," Postecoglou said after he was jeered by Tottenham fans after the final whistle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't like what was being said, because I'm a human being but you're going to cop it," he added. "All I can say is I'm determined to get it right, and will keep fighting until we do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Bournemouth have now beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham at home this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alex Iwobi scored twice as Fulham took advantage of a howler from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen to beat the Seagulls 3-1 at Craven Cottage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Silva's men were gifted the lead in the fourth minute when Verbruggen, under minimal pressure, tried to pass to Carlos Baleba on the edge of the area, with Iwobi intercepting and slotting into the empty net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton levelled in the 56th minute when Baleba fired past Bernd Leno from 25 yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Fulham went ahead again with 11 minutes remaining when Andreas Pereira's corner skimmed off Calvin Bassey and went in off Brighton's Matt O'Riley for an own goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Iwobi's curler sealed the points with three minutes left as Fulham moved up to sixth place after their third win in their last five league games. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three-time Olympic dressage gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin was on Thursday banned for a year following a horse-whipping controversy that led to her withdrawal from the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  The British rider was provisionally suspended by governing body the International Federation for Equestrian Sports just days before the start of the Olympics in the French capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The FEI said it had received a video "depicting Ms Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare", which showed her repeatedly striking a horse with a long whip.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, who has also been fined 10,000 Swiss francs, said she had made an "error of judgement" and expressed deep remorse.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is now sidelined from all competition until July next year, with the suspension backdated to July 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "British Equestrian and British Dressage have reciprocated the suspension, resulting in Dujardin's ineligibility to compete in any national competition or training events during this period," the FEI said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dujardin, Britain's joint most-decorated female Olympian, has won six Olympic medals including individual gold in 2012 and 2016. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A 121st-minute Dejan Ljubicic penalty took Cologne to a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin and a spot in the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hertha took the lead early when Ibrahim Maza converted a penalty after Derry Scherhant was felled in the box.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berlin's hopes took a hit soon after when Deyovaisio Zeefuik was red carded for a headbutt in the 25th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors equalised five minutes later when Florian Niederlechner scored an own goal from a Cologne corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  With scores locked at 1-1, the match went to extra time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ljubicic missed a sitter inches from goal on the 100th-minute mark but made good on his error, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way, with penalties looming, to book Cologne's place in the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  2015 winners Wolfsburg beat Hoffenheim 3-0 at home thanks to three goals in 22 second-half minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scoreless at half-time, Denis Vavro and Jonas Wind scored within four minutes of each other midway through the second half, before Yannick Gerhardt added a third to seal the game in the dying stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win continues Wolfsburg's improvement under former Southampton and RB Leipzig manager Ralph Hasenhuettl, with the Wolves now unbeaten in seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Lois Openda scored a brace as RB Leipzig roared back into form with a 3-0 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the German Cup last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig and their coach Marco Rose came into the game under pressure, after five losses and a draw during a winless November, against a Frankfurt side sitting second in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayer Leverkusen, who eliminated 20-time winners Bayern Munich on Tuesday, have already booked their spot in the quarter-finals along with Stuttgart, Werder Bremen and Arminia Bielefeld, who are the sole third-division side in the final eight. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé said he will take full responsibility for a "big mistake" after the striker missed another penalty in champions Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at Athletic Bilbao in La Liga on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  A week after the French superstar failed from the spot in the Champions League against Liverpool, he endured further misery from 12 yards as Los Blancos allowed league leaders Barcelona to retain their four-point advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alejandro Berenguer fired Bilbao ahead early in the second half, with Jude Bellingham levelling for Madrid after Mbappé's penalty miss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, substitute Gorka Guruzeta snatched fourth-place Athletic victory in the 80th minute after a Fede Valverde error.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat and Mbappé's penalty miss will heap further pressure on to the former Paris Saint-Germain striker's shoulders after plenty of criticism in recent weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A big mistake in a match where every detail counts – I take full responsibility for it," said Mbappé in a post on social media network Instagram. "A difficult moment but it's the best time to change this situation and show who I am."
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward was downhearted after goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala saved his penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously (Mbappé) is sad, disappointed, but he has to continue," the Italian told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé has scored 10 goals in his first 20 games for Madrid across all competitions but is struggling for consistency.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's not at his best level but we have to give him time to adapt, he's scored 10 goals, he can do better and he's working to do that," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid were hoping to build on three consecutive wins in La Liga, despite missing Vinicius Junior and other injured stars, with Ancelotti bringing French midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni back into the starting line-up. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool's Premier League lead was cut to seven points by Arsenal and Chelsea after the Reds conceded a 90th-minute equaliser in a thrilling 3-3 draw at Newcastle on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea thrashed 10-man Southampton 5-1 to go second on goal difference ahead of Arsenal, who beat Manchester United 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's second-half double was not enough to extend Liverpool's seven-game winning run in all competitions as they failed to win for just the third time in 21 games under Arne Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league leaders were forced to come from behind at St James' Park twice, as Alexander Isak blasted Newcastle into a 1-0 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curtis Jones levelled before Anthony Gordon restored Newcastle's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah twice converted Trent Alexander-Arnold assists to turn the game around, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was a late sting in the tale as a rare error from Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher allowed Fabian Schar to squeeze in a late equaliser for the Magpies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He has done remarkably well for us and even today he was good. Unfortunately, he misjudged the situation," Liverpool boss Slot said of Kelleher's blunder.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Arsenal took full advantage by inflicting Ruben Amorim's first defeat as Manchester United boss. Once again, the Gunners were able to rely on their prowess from set-pieces to get the job done.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jurrien Timber broke the deadlock, heading in Declan Rice's corner nine minutes into the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  William Saliba did not know much about the second, as he diverted in Thomas Partey's header from Bukayo Saka's corner, but the Frenchman did not care as Arsenal had the breathing space they craved.
  <br>
  <br>
  A fourth consecutive win in all competitions confirmed Arsenal's return to form and applied a little pressure on Liverpool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special day – it's a joy to play in this stadium with that energy, it's something incredible," Arteta said. "We scored two set-pieces, but we could've scored from open play many more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim, meanwhile, said those set-pieces are what ultimately killed the game for United.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can put a lot of players near the goalkeeper, and it's almost impossible to fight for the ball," he said. "We already know we have to be better." (AFP)

    Man City thump Forest to snap seven-game winless run

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pep Guardiola said Manchester City had to break the habit of losing after snapping a seven-game winless streak by beating Nottingham Forest 3-0 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The English champions' barren run included six defeats, the worst run of Guardiola's managerial career.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, victory came at a cost as defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji had to be replaced due to injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We needed it. The club, the players needed to win – but it is just one game," said Guardiola. "The problems continue with Manu and Nathan."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In general, the most important thing was to break this routine of not winning games and finally we won," he added."But we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury woes have been at the heart of City's struggles in recent months with Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out for the season due to a serious knee problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne's return to the starting line-up for the first time in nearly three months showed what City have been missing as he helped restore order for Guardiola's men.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian teed up Bernardo Silva for an early opener and then fired home himself to double City's lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku rounded off the scoring in the second half as the home side did not suffer a repeat of last week's collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 against Feyenoord in the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola dismissed suggestions before the game that there had been a rift with De Bruyne, as he has been carefully managed back from injury problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Last season he out injured for many months, and this season as well – I'm so happy he's back," added Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He fought a lot," he went on to say. "In respect to his physicality and minutes against Feyenoord was not good, and that's why I decided not to play against Liverpool for the rhythm they play."
  <br>
  <br>
  Neither Akanji or Ake are expected to be fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday, but Phil Foden could return after missing the Forest match due to bronchitis. (AFP)

<img alt="Coleman Wong achieved the highest ever ranking recorded by a player from Hong Kong, at 128, on September 30. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782096_1_20241204170448.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s top-ranked tennis player Coleman Wong on Wednesday said he is ready for the thrills that come with competing on home turf, as he gears up for his return to the Hong Kong Tennis Open at the end of the month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Four of the world’s top 20 players have been announced as new additions to an already star-studded line-up, with Lorenzo Musetti of Italy, France’s Arthur Fils and Russia’s Karen Khachanov set to join defending champion Andrey Rublev on Victoria Park Centre Court from December 29 to January 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Wong, 20, remains unfazed by the prospect of competing among such star power, saying this has encouraged him to elevate his performance, and he's counting on the support of home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I really like playing in front of a huge crowd,” Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I’m really looking forward to it, because last year I already had this experience and it was amazing – I recall the stadium being full when I played, so I’m really excited to be out there again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The world number 170 enters the tournament coming off a rollercoaster of a season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting the year with an ATP ranking of 253, Wong qualified for his first Masters 1000 event in Miami back in March, and came within reach of the Hangzhou Open quarterfinals in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong rose to achieve the highest ever ranking recorded by a player from Hong Kong, at 128, on September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is confident in his ability and level of play ahead of the competition in Hong Kong – including the opportunity to compete against Rublev.
  <br>
  <br>
  “He’s such a good player,” said Wong. “He’s one of those guys I’ve watched videos of, and I’ve seen him quite a few times in other tournaments from outside Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  “So I’m looking forward to hopefully playing against him in one of these rounds this coming competition.”

    Bayern knocked out of German Cup, Neuer sees first red

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bayern Munich were dumped out of the German Cup by holders Bayer Leverkusen as Nathan Tella's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win for the Bundesliga champions on Tuesday, after Manuel Neuer saw the first red card of his 866-game career.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 38-year-old rushed out of the box in typical fashion 18 minutes in to the German Cup last-16 clash, taking out an advancing Jeremie Frimpong and seeing a straight red.
  <br>
  <br>
  Neuer's sending-off brought Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz on for his Bayern debut, 18 months after joining the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern, who were already without the injured Harry Kane, dug deep despite the one-man disadvantage and dominated the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors eventually broke through in the 69th minute, though, with Tella heading in an Alex Grimaldo cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tella had only been on the field for eight minutes having come on for injured striker Patrik Schick, who himself was subbed on at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Home winger Michael Olise lashed inches wide in the fourth minute of stoppage time but Leverkusen held on to inflict a first domestic defeat on Vincent Kompany since he became Bayern coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were too hectic and tried to go forward too quickly," Leverkusen captain Jonathan Tah said. "At half-time, we said we need to be patient – and we did it.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The red card decided the game," Neuer told reporters after the match. "It hurt us, and I'm sorry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's Leverkusen, who won an unbeaten league and cup double last season, are through to the last eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bayern have won the German Cup a record 20 times – 14 more than the next best – but have not made it past the quarter-finals since 2020, when they defeated Leverkusen 4-2 in the final. (AFP)

    Leicester, Palace record midweek Premier League wins

<img alt="Leicester striker Jamie Vardy celebrates after scoring his team's first goal. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781986_1_20241204071347.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said he had been "astonished" by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester's eight but failed to make it count.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze's pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles' first away win of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. (AFP)

    Barcelona return to winning ways at Mallorca

<img alt="Yamal returned to the Barca line-up after recovering from an ankle injury. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781977_1_20241204054235.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Raphinha and Lamine Yamal inspired Barcelona to a first win in four La Liga outings as they beat Mallorca 5-1 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comprehensive victory brings the Catalans to 37 points at the top of the league table, four ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, but with two extra matches played.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti's Spanish and European champions will have the chance to cut that lead back to one point on Wednesday when they travel to Athletic Bilbao.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca stay sixth in La Liga, still two points behind Athletic Bilbao in the final Champions League spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferran Torres gave Barcelona the lead, before Vedat Muriqi equalised to ensure the sides were level at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha and Yamal lit up the second half as the away side ran riot with the Brazilian scoring a double, followed by strikes from Frenkie de Jong and Pau Victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona were boosted by the return of teenage starlet Yamal, who started the match after recovering from an ankle problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hansi Flick's side dropped points in the two league outings Yamal missed, and were also defeated last time out at home to lowly Las Palmas when he was only fit enough to start on the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts gifted Barca the lead in the 12th minute when panicked defending resulted in Torres being presented with a golden opportunity when there seemed to be no danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a trio of Majorcan defenders shepherded the ball back to their goalkeeper, full-back Johan Mojica suddenly decided to try to lash it away, only to smash the ball straight into Antonio Raillo and it fell perfectly to the feet of the Barcelona forward, who duly stroked home the opener.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans' high defensive line caught Mallorca out on several occasions as they tried to spring their attackers with passes over the top.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mallorca were, however, starting to build pressure on Barcelona, though the visitors remained dangerous on the counter with their fleet-footed attacking quartet of Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha and Torres.
  <br>
  <br>
  A second goal in the match did not seem far away, for either side, and it came for the hosts in the 43rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inigo Martinez was deeper than the rest of the Barcelona line and Pablo Maffeo timed his run onto Sergi Darder's pass to perfection, before rolling the ball across to Muriqi to tap into an open net. (AFP)

 Australian international Jordan Petaia said Tuesday he has quit rugby to chase his NFL dream, joining a growing list of players setting their sights on the lucrative American sport.
 <br>
  <br>
  Petaia has earned 31 caps for the Wallabies since his 2019 debut, and is considered one of Australian rugby's most promising backline talents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The decision to step away from rugby hasn't been easy and one that took a great deal of consideration," the 24-year-old said in a statement on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels like the right time in my career to pursue this dream I've had for a long time," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Les Kiss, Petaia's club coach at the Queensland Reds, said he was "one of the most dynamic players in Australia, if not the world."
  <br>
  <br>
  The NFL said Petaia had joined its International Player Pathway program, which gives stars from other sports the chance to be signed by one of 32 teams in the league.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starting in January, he will spend 10 weeks learning the game in Florida before he gets the chance to impress scouts at a "pro day" in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Petaia follows in the footsteps of Australian Jordan Mailata, a little-known rugby league player signed by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018 after coming through the programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mailata, who has impressed during his six years with the Eagles, signed a US$66 million contract extension earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Welsh speedster Louis Rees-Zammit stunned the rugby world in January when he quit the sport on the eve of the Six Nations and announced his NFL ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rees-Zammit was used sparingly in pre-season games, and was cut from the Kansas City Chiefs' 53-man playing roster.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six athletes have made active rosters for NFL teams after completing the pathway program, according to the NFL. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal are set to host Manchester United in the FA Cup third round next month in a meeting of the competition's two most successful clubs.
 <br>
  <br>
  United are the holders after winning it for the 13th time last season, while Arsenal lifted the last of their record 14 trophies in 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie is set for the weekend of January 11-12 at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City, winners in 2023 and runners-up in May, host fourth-tier Salford, owned by United's 'Class of 92' made up of David Beckham, the Neville brothers, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are also at home to League Two opponents in Accrington Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea play Morecambe, the fourth division's bottom side, while Newcastle play other League Two strugglers Bromley.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham were drawn away to Tamworth, who are one of only two non-league clubs left in the competition. Fellow National League side Dagenham and Redbridge are away to second-tier Millwall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the third round the 44 clubs from the Premier League and Championship enter the competition, joining the 20 lower-league and non-league sides who won in the previous round. (AFP)

 Italy will host the Davis Cup Finals from 2025 to 2027, the International Tennis Federation announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eight-team men's event, called the "Final 8", was won this year by Jannik Sinner's Italy, who triumphed in Spain last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Malaga has hosted the event since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to partner with the FITP (Italian Tennis Federation) for the Davis Cup Final 8," said ITF president David Haggerty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Italy has a rich history in tennis and a proven ability to host world-class sporting events," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 finals will be staged in Bologna.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are thrilled to have been selected as hosts," Angelo Binaghi, president of the FITP, said. "We look forward to welcoming the best teams in the world to our country next November and for the next three years." (AFP)

    Ronaldo-less Al Nassr suffer first AFC defeat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cristiano Ronaldo watched on from the stands as already-qualified Al Nassr lost for the first time in this year's Asian Champions League Elite as they were beaten 2-1 in injury time by Qatar's Al Sadd on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese star, 39, was reportedly rested for the fixture in Riyadh given the Saudi club had secured their place in the knockout stages last week, with three rounds of the group phase remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo scored twice against Al Gharafa, another Qatari side, last time out, and then netted a double again in the Saudi Pro League on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Al Nassr captain was omitted from Stefano Pioli's matchday squad for the visit of Al Sadd.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo, who has 15 goals in 18 appearances for his club this season, was spotted at Al Awwal Park sitting alongside his mother Dolores Aveiro and his partner Georgina Rodriguez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Sadd took the lead eight minutes into the second half through Akram Afif, when the reigning AFC Player of the Year raced from the halfway line onto a long ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Afif outpaced defender Mohammed Al Fatil and finishing low past Brazil goalkeeper Bento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Al Nassr drew level on 80 minutes, once Brazilian youngster Wesley's low cross was turned into his own goal by Al Sadd defender Romain Saiss.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there would be a huge sting in the tail for Al Nassr, when Afif was tripped inside the hosts' penalty area and substitute Adam Ounas converted from the spot in the 99th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the defeat, Al Nassr stay third in the Western Region group stage, while Al Sadd move fourth to also claim a spot in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top eight teams qualify for the knockout stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow Saudi side Al Ahli remain top – even if they surrendered their 100 percent record in this year's tournament – thanks to an Ivan Toney double that secured a 2-2 draw with Iran's Esteghlal in Jeddah.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England striker twice equalised for the hosts from the penalty spot, with the first coming deep into first-half injury time and the second converted in the 86th minute. Esteghlal had Mohammed Hossein Eslami sent off five minutes before.
  <br>
  <br>
  It represented a second successive Champions League Elite match in which Toney has scored twice following his double last week against Asian champions Al Ain. (AFP)
