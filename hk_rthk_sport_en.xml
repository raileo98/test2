<div class="itemFullText">
 Justin Rose remained atop a star-studded leaderboard after the second round of the Masters on Friday , with defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau all within three shots of the lead.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rose followed his opening 65 with a 1-under 71 that left him 8 under for the tournament. He was one ahead of DeChambeau , the reigning US Open champion, whose rounds of 69-68 have him firmly in the mix for his first green jacket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking of first green jackets, McIlroy is in good shape to finally get his own. He had the low round of the day, a 6-under 66 to get to 6 under for the tournament. McIlroy needs only the Masters to complete the career grand slam.
  <br>
  <br>
  Corey Conners also was at 6 under, and Scheffler was in a group another shot back that included Shane Lowry, Matt McCarty and Tyrrell Hatton. Scheffler dropped a shot at the par-4 finishing hole, which played the toughest on the course Friday. (AP)

<img alt="Mohamed Salah says the prospect of winning before a full Enfield is what drives him crazy every day. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799966_1_20250411175726.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mohamed Salah said he is driven every day to deliver Premier League glory to Liverpool this season after signing a new two-year contract on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah, 32, has defied the distraction of months of speculation over his future by scoring 27 goals and providing 17 assists in the 31 league appearances to help open up an 11-point lead at the top of the table with seven games to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egyptian was part of the Liverpool side that delivered the club's first league title for 30 years in the 2019/20 season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Covid restrictions meant that the Reds lifted the trophy in front of an empty Anfield and there was no parade through the city's streets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I said in the beginning of the season, I just want to win the Premier League more than anything else," Salah told Liverpool's website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want it so bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we owe that to the fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  They deserve it, they deserve to enjoy it after that long time, with celebrating at Anfield and in the street and just enjoying ourselves winning the Premier League."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the prospect of winning the title in front of a full Anfield, Salah said "that's something that drives me crazy every day – to come to work and push myself and push the other players also, because we are closer than ever now that we can win it in a special way."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool manager Arne Slot has also had to deal with persistent questioning over the futures of captain Virgil van Dijk and right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who are also out of contract at the end of the campaign, during his first season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman said news of Salah's new deal may have come as a "pleasant surprise" for supporters but praised the club's sporting director Richard Hughes for ensuring the Egyptian remains at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how his contract situation went over the course of the whole season," said Slot.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer, of course, that things were heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend Mo Salah, who is such a great player as a free agent, that he can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But he stayed at our club and that's also a compliment for Richard." (AFP)

    Lazio freeze as Bodo/Glimt take 2-0 first leg win

<img alt="Ulrik Saltnes celebrates after breaking the deadlock against Lazio. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799883_2_20250411110636.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two goals from Ulrik Saltnes spurred Bodo/Glimt to a 2-0 home victory over Lazio in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, with the one-sided encounter played out in freezing conditions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lazio arrived on Thursday in a windy Bodo to find snow had blanketed the pitch in the early hours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although the artificial turf was cleared in time for kick-off, the Italians struggled to adapt to the challenging zero-degree conditions in northern Norway, spending much of the match pinned back and on the defensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aiming to become the first Norwegian team ever to reach a European Cup semi-final, Bodo/Glimt neutralised Lazio's defence, attacking the box time and again.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Lazio registered just a single shot on target throughout the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am incredibly pleased with a lot but I do not think we should get carried away," Bodo/Glimt coach Kjetil Knutsen told Viaplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have a clear identity and an incredible strength within us. We should be happy with that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts seized early control, with Jens Petter Hauge firing a clever, short shot in the opening minutes that Lazio keeper Christos Mandas had to stretch to push out of danger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just after the half-hour mark, Bodo/Glimt came close again when Ole Didrik Blomberg received the ball inside the box but it slid off his foot as he prepared his shot and the effort went well wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt made the breakthrough just two minutes after the restart when Saltnes finished at close range following a precise short pass from Ole Didrik Blomberg to give the hosts the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the hosts looked to double their advantage, their sharp, quick passing continued to trouble the Lazio defence but several promising opportunities were squandered as they struggled to convert their finishing touches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bodo/Glimt scored their second goal in the 69th minute when Saltnes was played through and he lofted the ball over Mandas. Although Alessio Romagnoli managed to clear it, the ball had already crossed the line.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saltnes came close to scoring a hat-trick in the final minutes but Mandas made a crucial save.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lazio back-up keeper made another save in the last seconds from Odin Bjortuft's attempt.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They had speed in their exchanges because of the artificial pitch," Lazio manager Marco Baroni told Sky Sport Italia.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe that the second leg will be a different game and qualification is still open."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be next Thursday at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. (Reuters)

    10-man Rangers hold Bilbao to Europa League draw

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rangers held Athletic Bilbao to a nail-biting goalless draw at home in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final, despite being reduced to 10 men early on.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage on Thursday after Rangers defender Robin Propper was sent off in the 13th minute for a foul on Inaki Williams.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors, appearing in the last 16 of a major European competition for the first time since 2015-16, had a couple of clear-cut opportunities in the first half, with both Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet coming close.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, goalkeeper Liam Kelly produced a series of fine saves to keep them at bay as the Scottish Premiership side defended strongly and even threatened when Cyriel Dessers fired wide from long range.
  <br>
  <br>
  The game was delayed for seven minutes in the second half due to an injury to 18-year-old Bailey Rice, who was carried off on a stretcher after taking a knock on the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bilbao, who finished second in the league phase, thought they had broken the deadlock when substitute Alex Berenguer scored in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winger, however, was flagged offside after a VAR review but a penalty was awarded as the ball had bounced off the hand of defender James Tavernier before the goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sending-off seemed pretty clear to me. I didn't see the penalty well though, but it seemed a bit strange," Bilbao coach Ernesto Valverde said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yet at the last moment we lacked clarity and didn't manage to convert the spot kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The draw is not what we wanted considering they played with 10 men and we had chances," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goalkeeper Kelly again emerged as the hero with a crucial save from Berenguer to keep the result scoreless as Bilbao failed to score in a European game for the first time in their last 19 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That was a proper Rangers performance," Rangers boss Barry Ferguson told TNT sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's the exact reaction I wanted.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's what I spoke about on Monday and the players tonight showed a performance full of heart, grit and determination."
  <br>
  <br>
  The return leg will be played on Thursday at the San Mames stadium in Bilbao and the winners will face either Lyon or Manchester United, who drew 2-2 in the first leg, for a place in the final in Bilbao. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China squash player Simmi Chan secured a historic silver medal at the inaugural Under-23 World Squash Championships in Pakistan.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fourth-seeded Chan launched a fierce battle in the women’s title decider against Egypt’s top seed Fayrouz Abouelkheir, stretching the opening game to a tense tie-break before narrowly conceding it 10-12 after 28 minutes of relentless rallies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Though the SAR athlete fought hard, Abouelkheir capitalised on her momentum to claim the subsequent games 11-9 and 11-6, sealing the championship victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the defeat, Chan’s performance marked a milestone for Hong Kong, as she became the city’s first female athlete to secure a silver medal at the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her path to the final included a first-round bye followed by dominant victories over opponents from South Africa, Japan, and a hard-fought semifinal triumph against Malaysia’s Yee Xin-ying.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Billie Jean King Cup finals in Shenzhen have been brought forward from November to September, organisers announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The event had already been reduced from 12 teams to eight, aligning with the men's Davis Cup Finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifiers for the finals started on Thursday, with teams fighting for six tickets to China to join the hosts and defending champions Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This rescheduling from November to September aligns the event with the start of the WTA tournaments in Asia, supporting player calendar flow," the organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finals will get under way on September 16, with the final to be played on September 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy won their fifth title in the women's team event last year by defeating Slovakia in the final in Malaga.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as world number 10 Elena Rybakina earlier in the day showed all her battling qualities to beat Kimberly Birrell 6-3 7-6(4) and give Kazakhstan an unassailable 2-0 lead over seven-times champions Australia in their Billie Jean King Cup qualifier in Brisbane.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, went down an early break in the Group D tie but cranked up her powerful forehand and drew level after six games before claiming the opening set on serve with a big ace at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Birrell raced to a 5-1 lead in the next but squandered a set point and Rybakina clawed her way back with some ferocious shot-making to clinch victory via the tiebreak.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was such a difficult match," said Rybakina, who secured her eighth victory in 10 singles matches since her debut in the competition in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm super happy to bring the win for the team ... it's always nice to be back in Australia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Yulia Putintseva defeated debutant Maya Joint 6-2 6-1 at Pat Rafter Arena to give Kazakhstan the early lead in the best-of-three matches contest. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United on Thursday assured SAR fans that a “full team” including captain Bruno Fernandes will be featured in a friendly against Hong Kong, China next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The match – set for May 30 at Hong Kong Stadium – is part of the Red Devils’ post-season Asia tour, which kicks off with a stop in Kuala Lumpur.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks the Premier League side’s return to the SAR after 12 years. They last visited the city in 2013, when they defeated local club Kitchee 5-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press event held a day before tickets went on sale, Manchester United’s Director of Tour and Friendlies Christoffer Komen said the lineup is still being finalised, but promised the team will put on a show.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted key players are not required for international duty until June and that a “full team” should be coming to the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  “You can be confident to see our stars, of course led by our team captain Bruno, we’ve also got all the players lined up currently to join us on a plane,” Komen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was backlash last year over Lionel Messi’s no-show at an exhibition match in the SAR, which left local supporters frustrated.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the press event, Eric Fok, chairman of the Football Association of Hong Kong, China welcomed the Red Devils’ return, calling it an opportunity to attract football enthusiasts across Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the event was Ashley Westwood, head coach of the SAR football team, who said the squad would treat the friendly as preparation for their Asian Cup qualifier against India in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  ProEvents, organiser of the friendly, said there are contractual agreements in place to ensure the appearance of United's key players.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You just heard from Manchester United's executive saying that they will be coming with the full team." said its chairman, Paul Kam.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have also seen the list and they are coming, with obviously the first one being Bruno Fernandes, the captain. Together with [Alejandro Garnacho] and other players, they're all in there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for the friendly fixture will go on sale at noon on Friday via ticketing platform Cityline. They will be priced between HK$390 to HK$2,990.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic rued a "horrible" performance as he crashed out of the Monte-Carlo Masters in his opening match.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fifth-ranked Djokovic struggled to find his rhythm in a 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chilean Alejandro Tabilo in the second round  on Wednesday, making an inauspicious start to his clay season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic, 37, went into the tournament hampered by an eye infection that has been troubling him since the semi-finals in Miami at the end of March and admitting that he did not have "very high" expectations for Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  As it transpired a sluggish performance meant that Tabilo, who also beat Djokovic on clay in last year's Italian Open in Rome, faced few difficulties in claiming a rare 2-0 head-to-head record against the 24-time Grand Slam winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was actually more like the worst day [at the office]," said Djokovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I'm going to play this way.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just horrible. Horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb, who is chasing his 100th ATP title, has not won a tournament since taking gold at last year's Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic brushed off any fitness concerns and said his main focus for the clay season was the French Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is set to play in Madrid later this month for the first time since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I expected myself at least to have put a decent performance. Not like this. It was horrible," said Djokovic, who has only once reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo since the last of his two titles in the principality in 2015.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I'm gonna have a tough opponent and I knew I'm gonna probably play pretty bad.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But this bad, I didn't expect."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tabilo, ranked 32 in the world, will face Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the last 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there," said Tabilo, who earned consecutive tour-level wins for the first time since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was an unreal match." (AFP)

    2028 Olympics to make a splash with six new events

<img alt="Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799728_1_20250410112258.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six new events were added to the Olympic swimming programme, with 50m backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke to be contested for the first time at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Previously, only freestyle was raced over the sport's shortest distance despite all four strokes being on the schedule at world championships.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Wednesday of their inclusion for Los Angeles brings the swimming gold medal count to 41 from 35 at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall there will be 55 medals awarded in aquatics – which also includes artistic swimming, water polo, diving, and open water – more than any other sport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's decision is a testament to the continued evolution of swimming at the Olympic Games," said World Aquatics president Husain Al Musallam after the move was ratified by the International Olympic Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Including these six new events enhances the programme's balance and adds more opportunities for athletes to showcase their skills on the world's biggest stage."
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimming is one only four sports contested at every Olympics since the first Games in 1896, alongside athletics, artistic gymnastics and fencing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States and Australia have long been dominant in the pool, with the two nations again at the forefront in Paris last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IOC also announced that the number of female athletes competing in Los Angeles (5,333) will exceed men (5,167) for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It follows the women's football tournament being boosted to 16 teams. The men's competition has 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  An additional women's weight category in boxing and two extra women's water polo teams ensure gender parity in those sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  A number of new mixed-team events were also confirmed, including in golf, gymnastics and table tennis, while a 4x100m mixed relay was added to the track and field competition. (AFP)

<img alt="Luka Doncic and LeBron James keep things cool in the fourth quarter against the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799727_1_20250410111305.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic shrugged off the raw emotion of his return to Dallas with a dazzling 45-point display against his former club as the Los Angeles Lakers downed the Mavericks 112-97 to punch their ticket to the NBA playoffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who joined the Lakers from Dallas in February in one of the most shocking trades in NBA history, was given a rousing reception by Mavs fans packed into the American Airlines Center to pay tribute to their former hero  on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  A pre-game video montage was screened in the arena just before Doncic was introduced to the sellout crowd of 20,841 fans, many wearing t-shirts bearing the words "Thanks for Everything", written in the 26-year-old's native Slovenian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic visibly teared up as he watched the tribute, and looked distraught as he was comforted by Lakers team-mate LeBron James moments before tip-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after that emotional pre-game ceremony, Doncic quickly snapped into game mode, swiftly getting into his scoring groove to give Mavericks fans a painful reminder of the generational talent that was traded away by the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic scored 14 in the first quarter alone, and added a further 17 in the second period to help the Lakers into a 60-57 half-time lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic's rate of scoring slowed in the second half, leaving James to produce a trademark fourth quarter burst to close out victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was still time for Doncic to sign off in style, nailing an imperious three-pointer to push the Lakers into a 108-94 lead shortly before exiting the game to a standing ovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The applause swiftly morphed into chants of "Fire Nico" – a reference to the Dallas general manager Nico Harrison who has been roundly criticised by Mavs for engineering the trade that sent Doncic to Los Angeles in exchange for Anthony Davis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic later admitted he had struggled to maintain his composure during the pre-game ceremony.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know how I did it because when I was watching that video I was like 'There's no way I'm playing this game'," he told ESPN.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But all my teammates had my back and were really supporting me.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There were so many emotions I can't even explain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It brought tears to my eyes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I came here as a young kid, aged 18, and they made me feel like it was home.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just a lot of great memories.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love these fans, I love this city but it's time to move on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory means the Lakers, who improved to 49-31, can clinch third seed in the Western Conference if they win one of their final two regular-season games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic's 45 points included seven three-pointers from 16-of-28 shooting, while James finished with 27 points, seven rebounds and three assists. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona coach Hansi Flick warned their Champions League rivals his team are still looking to improve after beating Borussia Dortmund 4-0.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Catalans put one foot into the semi-finals with the first leg thrashing of last year's runners-up at the Olympic Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barca are the competition's top scorers with 36 goals and their dynamic attacking trio of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Lamine Yamal strike fear into the hearts of opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to keep improving, today we saw some points we can improve on," Flick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will analyse this game and I will tell the players they did very well, but there are still things to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy with the result today but it's just the first step."
  <br>
  <br>
  Raphinha netted his 12th Champions League goal of the season – he is the top scorer in the competition – and added two assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian has 19 direct goal contributions this season in Europe, equalling former Barca great Lionel Messi's record for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always thought he's an extraordinary player... the team is set on his shoulders, his dynamism," said the coach.
  <br>
  <br>
  His opposite number Niko Kovac was disappointed with Dortmund's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a deserved defeat [but] we could have got a goal, as we all know the return leg will be very difficult," said Kovac.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am optimistic but I have to be a realist... it was a very big result, our chances of going through are minimal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We know it will be difficult but we have to have a spark of hope, because without that spark it will be impossible." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa coach Unai Emery insists he still believes his side can get the better of Paris Saint-Germain and reach the Champions League semi-finals despite a 3-1 defeat in the first leg of their last-eight tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa took the lead in the first half in Paris through Morgan Rogers, only for the hosts to turn the game on its head thanks to stunning strikes by Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia either side of the interval.
  <br>
  <br>
  And a Nuno Mendes effort in stoppage time, which gives PSG a two-goal cushion to take to Villa Park for the return leg, appears to leave Emery's side with a huge task to turn the tie around.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At 2-1 we were thinking about playing to win in the next match, and at 3-1 it is still the same," Emery said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we are here and enjoying it, and I am very proud of the players. We competed fantastically and we were close to getting a good result.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the end, with this goal, it is still more or less the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Villa Park is our home, and hopefully there we will be stronger.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But of course they are still favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They showed their power and individual quality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The second leg will be just as difficult at 3-1 as it was at 2-1. We have to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Emery's opposite number, Luis Enrique, expressed delight but emphasised that PSG would not sit back and "speculate" in the second leg on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The quality of PSG's goals was exceptional, with Doue's marvellous strike for the equaliser probably topped by Kvaratskhelia's remarkable individual effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mendes then rounded Emiliano Martinez to make it 3-1 following a superb Ousmane Dembele pass, capping PSG's victory in a game that saw them enjoy 68 percent possession and 30 attempts on goal to Villa's eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our objective in Birmingham is clear, to try to win the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how to speculate, or to sit back and defend deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will try to have the ball and attack more than the opposition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't doubt it will be harder there but that is what we will try to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  PSG will have skipper Marquinhos available again to line up in central defence in the return after he sat out the first leg due to suspension. (AFP)

 Hong Kong, China Sanda martial artist Leung Yu-hong triumphed at the 10th Sanda World Cup in Jiangyin, claiming gold in the men’s 60-kilos category.
 <br>
  <br>
  The victory adds to his historic 2023 achievement, when he secured Hong Kong’s first-ever Sanda gold at the World Wushu Championships in Texas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sanda, also referred to as Sanshou, is a Chinese combat sport blending traditional kung fu techniques - such as strikes, kicks, throws and grappling - with modern fighting tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR team further showcased its prowess at the biennial event, earning three additional medals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sunny Cheung secured silver in the men’s 70-kilos division, while Cai Jia-hao and Chan Tsz-ching added bronze medals to the team’s haul in the men's over 90-kilogrammes and the women's 56-kilogrammes respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biennial world cup saw participation from 26 countries and regions, with nearly 170 athletes competing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's 3-0 win over Real Madrid means at least five Premier League teams will play in next season's Champions League, the English top flight confirmed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top four sides in the Premier League automatically qualify for Europe's top club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But due to the success of English clubs in the three European competitions, England is now guaranteed a top-two placing in Uefa's association club coefficient rankings, which earns a European Performance Spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  England lead the way, with Spain and Italy next on the list.
  <br>
  <br>
  Five English teams are involved in the quarter-finals of the various European competitions – Arsenal and Aston Villa in the Champions League, Manchester United and Tottenham in the Europa League and Chelsea in the Conference League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League could potentially have as many as seven clubs in next season's Champions League – the top five teams in the league, plus the Champions League winners and the Europa League winners if they finish outside the top five.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool are almost certain to win the Premier League and Arsenal, in second, are well-placed.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there is a scrap for the remaining Champions League spots, with just six points separating third-placed Nottingham Forest from Villa, in seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal shocked 15-time European champions Real Madrid 3-0 on Tuesday in the first leg of their quarter-final, with Villa in action against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday. (AFP)

    Shai holds court as Lakers sink after Doncic ejection

<img alt="Oklahoma City Thunder guards shut down Pau Gasol of the Los Angeles Lakers in the midst of a shot. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799573_1_20250409122147.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 42 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder bounced back to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 136-120 in a hard-fought battle that saw Luka Doncic controversially ejected in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after suffering a 27-point defeat to the Lakers, the No 1-ranked Thunder avenged that loss on Tuesday thanks to Gilgeous-Alexander's 13th 40-point game of the season, with Jalen Williams adding 26 and Lugentz Dort 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The contest pivoted on the fourth quarter incident that led to the Lakers' Slovenian star Doncic picking up a second technical foul and being tossed from the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic was ejected following a one-handed jump shot that put the Lakers 108-107 up with 7min 40sec remaining after officiating crew member J T Orr judged he had been verbally abused by the player following the bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic protested, arguing he had merely been responding to a fan at courtside who had heckled him, but the decision stood and clearly rattled the Lakers, allowing the Thunder to seize the initiative and pull away for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a great game that unfortunately didn't get the finish that I think every basketball fan would want because of some decision making on some individuals' parts," Lakers coach J J Redick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  LeBron James, who finished with 28 points, was at a loss to explain Doncic's ejection.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't know why the ref was taking it personal," James said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The ref took it upon himself to think it was versus him. The game was just weird as hell after that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic insisted he had not been trash-talking Orr.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was nothing to do with the ref, so I didn't really understand it," Doncic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough, but you know that's on me too. I can't let my team down like that."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers remain in third place with a 48-31 record and need to win two of their remaining three regular-season fixtures to lock in third seeding in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cleveland Cavaliers clinched N.1 seeding in the NBA Eastern Conference playoffs after cruising past the Chicago Bulls 135-113.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland led the scoring with 28 points in a balanced offensive performance from the Cavs, who improved to 63-16 to ensure they will finish the regular season on top of the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory ensures Cleveland will have home advantage when the playoffs get under way next week following the completion of the regular season on Sunday. (AFP)

    Zverev suffers shock exit at Monte-Carlo Masters

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Top seed Alexander Zverev crashed out in his opening match of the Monte-Carlo Masters with Italy's Matteo Berrettini as defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and Britain's Jack Draper both advanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  World number two Zverev has struggled for any kind of form since his defeat by Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final at the end of January, winning just six of 12 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with a first-round bye in the absence of world number one Sinner, who is suspended for a doping violation until May 4, Zverev was among the favourites.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a controlled start to the game, the German slumped to a 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 defeat to 34th-ranked Berrettini, at the end of a high-flying match, which had included an impressive 48-stroke rally won by the Italian.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been the worst period since my injury [the] last few months," said Zverev who has suffered a string of early exits of late, including at Indian Wells.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a great first set, and once I got broken in the second set I play ten levels down. My ball is much slower. I stopped hitting the ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same story the last few months. Nothing changes. So it's me who lost the match, once again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I thought my level was terrible, but that's just my opinion."
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champion and three-time Monte Carlo winner Tsitsipas advanced past 38th-ranked Australian Jordan Thompson.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a lacklustre US tour, the Dubai winner won through 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in his second round tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Indian Wells champion Draper, seeded fifth, eased past 45th-ranked American Marcos Giron 6-1, 6-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Novak Djokovic – the winner in 2013 and 2015 – and Carlos Alcaraz start their campaigns on Wednesday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An 88th-minute Davide Frattesi goal took Inter Milan to a 2-1 win at Bayern Munich, giving the Italians the edge after the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Undermanned Bayern, nursing a bulging casualty ward, set the tone in the first half-hour on Tuesday, with Michael Olise and Harry Kane narrowly failing to break through.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter opened the scoring on the 38-minute mark when Marcus Thuram's clever back-heel found Lautaro Martinez who blasted home.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Italians maintained control until Bayern veteran Thomas Mueller, days after announcing a summer departure after 25 years at the club, scored the equaliser with a typical poacher's finish with five minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not content to be spectators to a Bayern fairytale ending, Inter broke on the counter just three minutes later, with Carlos Augusto finding Frattesi, who scored Inter's second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter, defeated in the final by Manchester City two seasons ago, have their noses in front in their bid to make the last four of the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inter goalscorer Martinez toasted the "complete performance", telling Amazon Prime his side showed "character, personality", adding "the boys showed what they were made of".
  <br>
  <br>
  The late goal consigned Bayern to their first home defeat in the Champions League since 2021, a run of 22 matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two-time Champions League winner Mueller lamented Inter's "stupid" late goal, saying "when we watch the footage, when we analyse it, we'll know we could have done better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It wasn't a brutal defeat. We've played the first half, the first leg – we imagined a different result but we know there's still something in it for us." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mikel Arteta admitted Arsenal defied the odds with their stunning 3-0 win against Real Madrid as Declan Rice's free-kick magic left the Champions League holders in disarray.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rice inspired one of the greatest results in Arsenal's storied history with two blistering free-kicks in the second half of the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino scored the third goal for Arteta's side as they moved within touching distance of a first Champions League semi-final appearance since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an incredible moment for England midfielder Rice, who had never scored a free-kick in his career – a period spanning 338 previous matches – before the first of his thunderbolts flashed past Real keeper Thibaut Courtois.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal had also failed to find the net from a direct set-piece in almost four years, with their last coming via Martin Odegaard against Burnley in September 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gunners captain Odegaard put his hands on his head in disbelief when Rice completed his set-piece double, while Arteta was equally surprised.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Declan's been very determined because we have said in the last few months that we have not scored a direct free-kick in three-and-half years," the Arsenal manager said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, to score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and of that quality from the same player, a player that has never scored a free-kick before in his career, what are the odds?
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a player who can do it, how clean he strikes it it's Declan. But you have to execute it at the highest level. And against one of the best keepers in the world as well. It's amazing."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a cathartic result for Arsenal, who have endured a rocky season marred by their failure to keep pace with Liverpool in the Premier League title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are 11 points adrift of Liverpool, leaving the Champions League as their last chance this season to win a first trophy since the 2020 FA Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Few would have expected them to get past 15-time European champions Real before the first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  But now Arsenal will travel to the Bernabeu for the return tie next week as firm favourites to progress to a last four clash against Paris Saint-Germain or Aston Villa. (AFP)

    Grand National winning jockey Mullins suspended

<img alt="Disciplinary officials found Patrick Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Patrick Mullins has been given an eight-day suspension after he was found to have breached whip rules when riding Nick Rockett to Grand National glory on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Irish amateur rider steered the eight-year-old to victory in the celebrated steeplechase at the Aintree course in Liverpool to complete a notable family double, given 33-1 shot Nick Rockett is trained by his father, Willie Mullins.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the race, Willie Mullins, who achieved the impressive feat of saddling the first three home in the world's most famous jumps race, in addition to being the father of the winning rider, said: "This is the best day ever, this will never be topped."
  <br>
  <br>
  Disciplinary officials, however, found Mullins had used his whip one above the permitted level of seven from the final fence.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the Grand National is deemed to be a Class One race under British rules, the usual penalty of four days for such an offence was doubled.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Mullins was, therefore, suspended for eight days in April and May.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result of the Grand National remained unaltered, however, as is often the case with whip offences in British horseracing.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a situation critics believe encourages jockeys to break the rules, particularly in showpiece races such as the Grand National, rather than face the possible anger of owners, trainers and punters who might otherwise claim their horse has not been 'ridden out' fully in a finish. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Denver Nuggets, mired in a four-game losing streak as the NBA playoffs approach, fired coach Michael Malone on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Malone led the Nuggets to the NBA title in 2023, but despite the exploits of three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets have struggled for consistency this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are fourth in a tight Western Conference race with four teams just a half-game behind them.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Denver Nuggets have relieved head coach Michael Malone of his duties and will not extend general manager Calvin Booth," the Nuggets said in a statement, adding that assistant coach David Adelman will assume head coaching duties for the remainder of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nuggets have three games remaining in the regular season, which concludes on Sunday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Referees at this year's Club World Cup will be equipped with body cameras and instructed to implement new rules to cut down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, Fifa announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The use of the cameras will be on a trial basis after they were approved last month by Ifab, the sport's lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We think that it is a good chance to offer the viewers a new experience, in terms of images taken from a perspective, from an angle of vision which was never offered before," said Pierluigi Collina, chairman of the Fifa referees committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a combination of new experience for broadcasters and also for coaching purposes," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having the possibility to see what the referee sees is important in the debriefing, to evaluate how the call was made by the referee, which was his view, and so on."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-team competition in the United States will also attempt to crack down on time-wasting by goalkeepers, awarding a corner to the opposing team if they hold on to the ball beyond eight seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  The current rule states that 'keepers are supposed to be sanctioned with an indirect free-kick if they hold on for more than six seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the offence is rarely penalised.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Club World Cup begins on June 14 and runs until July 13. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Florida and Walter Clayton somehow overcame Houston’s tough defence on Monday night to carve out a 65-63 victory in an NCAA title-game thriller which was not decided until Clayton’s own D stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was getting Houston’s Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning three points in the final seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for travelling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, and they won their third overall title and first since 2007, this time led by third-year coach Todd Golden.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Daniil Medvedev navigated his way into the second round of the Monte Carlo Masters on Monday, eventually seeing off former world number eight Karen Khachanov 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former US Open winner Medvedev fought through in just shy of three hours on Court Rainier III against Khachanov, after having been a set and a break up on his fellow Russian.
  <br>
  <br>
  After an early exit from the Miami Open last month caused the 29-year-old to exit the top 10, Medvedev got back to winning ways on clay as he chases his first title since claiming the Rome Open two years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, 11th seed Ben Shelton was stunned by 42nd-ranked Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and there will be no showdown between Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka after the Swiss was defeated by Alejandro Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shelton went down 6-7 (2/7), 6-2, 6-1 to his Spanish opponent, who reached the 2022 final at Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wild card Wawrinka also played out an epic that lasted nearly two-and-a-half hours before succumbing 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 to Chile's Tabilo.
  <br>
  <br>
  France's Gael Monfils beat Hungarian Fabian Marozsan 4-6, 6-1, 6-1 and Matteo Berrettini set up a second-round meeting with top seed Alexander Zverev after winning in straight sets against Mariano Navone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Felix Auger-Aliassime went down to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, but fellow top 20 player Lorenzo Musetti avoided a similar fate by coming back from a set down to defeat qualifier Bu Yunchaokete of China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic beat American Sebastian Korda and Marcos Giron overcame fellow North American Denis Shapovalov, both in straight sets. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Newcastle coasted to a 3-0 win over sorry Leicester on Monday to step up their Champions League charge and condemn the Foxes to an eighth straight Premier League defeat without scoring.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's men, still on a high after winning the League Cup last month, are up to fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed Chelsea but with a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth place will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the Champions League next season after strong performances by English clubs in continental competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  But relegation for Ruud van Nistelrooy's hapless team is all but certain after a solitary season in the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 2-0 up in the 11th minute after two goals from Jacob Murphy, the second a tap-in from close range after an audacious effort from Fabian Schar hit the crossbar, and Harvey Barnes added a third before half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leicester last scored a league goal in front of their own fans against Brighton on December 8 and they are the first side in football league history to lose eight home league games in a row without scoring a goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle boss Howe said his "biggest challenge" had been maintaining focus after the club ended their 56-year trophy drought in the League Cup final against Liverpool last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I can't compliment them enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  "They are a very down to earth, humble group who want to do well and represent the club in the right way. They have shown that in the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Howe said the race for the Champions League was "going to hot up".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The next week for us is a big week. We have three really tough games (against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa) and that will go a long way in seeing where we are at the end of the season." (AFP)

    Southampton sack manager Ivan Juric after relegation

<div class="itemFullText">
 Southampton have sacked manager Ivan Juric following their relegation from the Premier League, the club announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were condemned to relegation in record time after a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric's bottom-of-the-table side have lost 25 of their 31 top-flight games in a wretched campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Relegation with seven fixtures left gives Southampton, last season's Championship play-off winners, an unwanted Premier League record, surpassing Derby and Huddersfield's relegations with six games left in 2008 and 2019 respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Juric took over from Russell Martin in December, with Southampton already deep in trouble, but the 49-year-old won only one league match, at Ipswich in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saints have lost seven of their past eight league matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can confirm that we have today reached an agreement with our men's first-team manager, Ivan Juric, to end his spell at the club," said a Southampton statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ivan came to Southampton at a tough time and was tasked with trying to improve a squad in a difficult situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Unfortunately, we haven't seen performances progress the way we had hoped, but we would like to thank Ivan and his staff for their honesty and hard work as they fought against the odds to try and keep us up."
  <br>
  <br>
  Simon Rusk will take charge of the team as interim manager for the remainder of the season and will be assisted by Adam Lallana. (AFP)

<img alt="Novak Djokovic says his eye infection began during the recent Miami Open semi-finals. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799230_1_20250407125952.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 World No 5 Novak Djokovic, a finalist at the recent Miami Masters, said he did not have high expectations for the Monte Carlo Masters as he was suffering from the effects of an eye infection.
 <br>
  <br>
  Djokovic is a two-time winner in Monte Carlo but has not won any title since taking the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last summer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hard courts of Miami marked a return to form even though the 37-year-old lost the final in straight sets to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm glad that I found at least in Miami that joy on the court and, I feel, performance level," said the former world No 1 on Sunday ahead of the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's see if I can carry that into clay.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's obviously a completely different surface and I didn't have much time to get used to this tournament, so my expectations are not really high for the results here.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's more about trying to get matches and as many as possible, and obviously try to peak towards the end of the clay season which is, of course, most importantly in Paris."
  <br>
  <br>
  The French Open, which takes place on the red clay of Roland Garros between May 25 and May 8, is the second Grand Slam event of the season, following the Australian Open where Djokovic reached the semi-finals before bowing out, injured, to Alexander Zverev.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Serb admitted, however, that the eye infection and "a little bit of a viral infection" that he has been dealing with over the last week made him think twice about competing in Monte Carlo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It started in semi-finals day in Miami and I did struggle with it in the finals but it's calming down, I guess.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm visiting the doctor later today so let's see. It should be okay."
  <br>
  <br>
  Given a first round bye, Djokovic will face a second round match against either the Chilean Alejandro Tabilo or another veteran of the circuit, three-time Grand Slam winner Stanislas Wawrinka. (AFP)

    Alcaraz admits Sinner pressure getting to him

<img alt="Carlos Alcaraz says he is at peace with not being able to displace Jannik Sinner from his top ranking. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799227_1_20250407124847.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Carlos Alcaraz said pressure to reclaim the world number one ranking from the suspended Jannik Sinner has had a negative impact on his form this season.
 <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing," Alcaraz said ahead of the Monte Carlo Masters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So probably that pressure has killed me in some way."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 21-year-old Spaniard added that staying at world number three has not come as a shock to him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz has endured a tough start to 2025, with his only title coming on the hard courts of Rotterdam two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 1000 event in Monte Carlo signals the start of the clay-court season – a surface Alcaraz has excelled on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won the French Open last year, as well as back-to-back Madrid Masters in 2022 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner has been out of action since accepting a three-month doping ban in February after twice testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 23-year-old Italian is due to return in time for the Rome Open in May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcaraz, currently trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings, said he has been at peace with not usurping the Italian as the world's best player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's my mindset right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  After being eliminated on his debut in 2022 and withdrawing from the last two editions, Alcaraz has yet to win a match on the Monte Carlo clay.
  <br>

  Given a bye for the first round, he will seek to end that streak when he takes on the winner of round of 64 match between Francisco Cerundolo and Fabio Fognini. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored his 895th NHL career goal, etching his name into ice hockey history by finally passing the previous all-time record he shared with Wayne Gretzky.
 <br>
  <br>
  Washington Capitals ace Ovechkin – who had tied Gretzky's 26-year-old mark with two goals on Friday – scored on a power play early in the second period of Sunday's clash at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 39-year-old Russian icon smashed in a long-range shot with 12:34 remaining in the second period to spark wild celebrations at the UBS Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  An overjoyed Ovechkin dived along the ice in delight after his momentous strike, before being mobbed by team-mates as a packed arena rose in a standing ovation to the Russian's achievement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ice hockey's "Great One" Gretzky was in attendance along with National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman to witness Ovechkin's history-making strike, which was greeted by deafening chants of "Ovi, Ovi".
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin meanwhile celebrated with his mother, wife and children, who came on to the ice as play was halted to mark the occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What a day," Ovechkin said in an address to the stadium after play was stopped.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Like I always say, it's a team sport and without my boys, the whole organisation, the fans, the trainers, I would never stand here. I would never have passed 'The Great One'," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So fellas, thank you very much, I love you so much...And the last thing – to all of you fans around the world, in Russia, we did it boys."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky meanwhile also spoke in tribute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that," the Canadian told the crowd. (AFP)

<img alt="Manchester City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance after a dismal derby at Manchester United ended in a 0-0 stalemate.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his side must improve "everywhere" after a dismal derby against Manchester City ended 0-0 on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  City's hopes of Champions League qualification remain in the balance as they remain fifth in the Premier League, which should be enough to reach next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Pep Guardiola's men are just two points above Newcastle, who have two games in hand on City.
  <br>
  <br>
  A point leaves United languishing down in 13th, but they had the better of a game limited in chances as they missed out on a first league double over City since 2019/20.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have so many aspects to improve. Everywhere we need to improve in every aspect: build up, transition, decisions in the final third," said Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every player can improve, they are here because they showed something at other clubs. They have the quality, but we are still a team that plays on transition, we need to spend more time in final third to have more opportunities."
  <br>
  <br>
  Never in the Premier League era have neither City or United finished in the top four but that record is under severe threat in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  A contest devoid of quality, intensity or fight summed up a dreadful season for both sides of the Manchester divide.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a record four consecutive league titles, City's form has fallen off a cliff to leave them at risk of not making the top four for the first time since 2009/10.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's only chance of Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League as they are set for their worst ever Premier League finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Red Devils have shown flashes of improvement this week but also failed to score in their 1-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday to underline their problem in front of goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We just need to have a bit more of a killer instinct," said United captain Bruno Fernandes. "In the first half we had to many touches when we just needed one. We were patient, very organised but the killer instinct was missing today."
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin De Bruyne started just days after announcing this will be his final season at City.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Belgian's performance was the latest example that he is now a shadow of the figure Guardiola said will be remembered as one of the Premier League's all-time greats.
  <br>
  <br>
  City had the majority of the ball, but United were the more threatening side on the counter-attack in a pedestrian first half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were not good enough to punish them or hurt them a little bit more than what happened," said Guardiola. "We take the point. It would be better to win but still we are there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden had the game's best chance just seconds after half-time but fluffed his lines with only Andre Onana to beat.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spectacle did marginally improve after the break as Omar Marmoush's powerful effort from a corner stung the palms of Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount's introduction off the bench added more thrust to the United attack in the final 20 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both had a chance to win it when Zirkzee's shot was clawed away by Ederson and Rico Lewis did well to get in the way of Mount's follow-up effort.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were smiles during a warm embrace between Guardiola and Amorim at full-time but those pleasantries disguised the fact that neither man can be happy with the state of their sides after a disappointing campaign. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Luka Doncic scored 30 points as the Los Angeles Lakers produced a devastating display of long-range shooting to score a surprising 126-99 blowout over the No1 ranked Oklahoma City Thunder.
 <br>
  <br>
  A heavyweight showdown between the Western Conference leaders and the third-placed Lakers was effectively settled in the first half, as Los Angeles rattled in 15 three-pointers, a franchise record, to open up a 78-56 lead at the end of the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers never looked like surrendering that hefty double-digit cushion as they closed out a comfortable win to silence the Oklahoma City home crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win saw the Lakers edge closer to securing one of the four remaining automatic playoff spots in the West after already-qualified Oklahoma City and Houston.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Lakers poured in 22 three-pointers across the game, with Doncic responsible for five of them. Austin Reaves had four three-pointers in his 20 point haul, while LeBron James added 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Oklahoma City scoring with 26 points on an off-night for the Thunder, who shot just 43 percent from the field while making only 12-of-37 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James meanwhile said the Lakers had been determined not to let up after making a fast start against the Western Conference leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Between them and Cleveland, they're the best teams in the NBA," James said. "They're the number one team in the West so you can't let up no matter what the score is – they're always going to make a push. That's why they are where they are at this part of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So it's a really good win for us and we can build off it... we're just trying to build our habits right now, going into the final stretch of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Reaves meanwhile believes the result augured well for the final week of the regular season, which reaches its conclusion on April 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six teams are battling for four playoff spots in the West, from the third-placed Lakers (48-30) down to the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies (46-32).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's huge," Reaves said. "The way the standings are, you can go from third to eighth in the snap of a finger. So for us to come in and play such a good team the way we did tonight is big. Hopefully we can build on that momentum."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Sunday, the Cleveland Cavaliers missed the chance to lock up the No.1 seeding in the Eastern Conference after suffering a 120-113 home defeat to the Sacramento Kings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Boston Celtics meanwhile kept their slim hopes of grabbing No1 seed from Cleveland with a 124-90 rout of the Washington Wizards. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 North Korea said on Sunday that foreign elite runners arrived to take part in the first Pyongyang Marathon in six years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Athletes from China, Romania and other countries arrived in North Korea to participate in the event, state media KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Video footage from KCNA showed hundreds of runners taking off from the stadium track starting point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon is part of celebrations marking the birth of North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung in 1912 and is the largest international sporting event in North Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The race offers a rare opportunity for visitors to run through the streets of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  The marathon course winds through central Pyongyang, passing key landmarks and heading out into the countryside just outside of the city centre, before returning back to the stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last edition of the Pyongyang Marathon was held in 2019 before the pandemic, during which the state sealed its borders in an effort to contain the virus. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen led from pole to chequered flag to win the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday, his first victory of the 2025 season, with McLaren's Lando Norris second.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dutch Red Bull driver crossed the finish line almost 1.5 seconds in front of Briton Norris, who held off his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri of Australia in third.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win on a damp but drying track at Suzuka was Verstappen's fourth straight victory in Japan and closed the gap on Norris at the top of the drivers' championship to one point.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was tough. The McLarens were pushing me very hard," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a lot of fun but not easy pushing the tyres. I am incredibly happy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Starting on pole made it possible to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished fourth ahead of the Mercedes pair of George Russell and Kimi Antonelli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was seventh, with RB's Isack Hadjar next ahead of Williams' Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuki Tsunoda finished 12th in his first race for Red Bull since replacing Liam Lawson, having started from 14th on the grid in his home grand prix. Lawson was 17th for RB.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen and Norris were involved in a flashpoint midway through the race as the two front-runners emerged from a pit stop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris drew up alongside Verstappen but the Dutchman refused to budge and Norris was forced onto the grass before sliding back onto the track.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris said "he forced me off" but Verstappen told his team that he was not to blame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He drove himself onto the grass," said Verstappen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stewards reviewed the incident and decided not to investigate further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has struggled to get to grips with his Red Bull this season, finishing second in Australia and fourth in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pulled off a lap for the ages in qualifying in Suzuka, pipping Norris to claim his first pole of the season in a track-record time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen got away cleanly from Norris and Piastri at the first turn, with little change in the grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman quickly established control by laying down the fastest lap and his lead grew over the early part of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eighteen-year-old rookie Antonelli briefly took the lead while Verstappen and Norris were in the pits, to become Formula One's youngest-ever race leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen soon reclaimed the lead and his team gave him the green light to push until the end of the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two McLarens stayed on his tail, with Piastri telling his team "I have the pace to get Max" but Verstappen could not be caught.
  <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Suzuka had been dry all week, with a series of small trackside fires halting practice several times but rain early on Sunday removed any chance of a repeat in the race. (AFP)

 Hong Kong racing royalty Romantic Warrior came up just short at the Dubai Turf, as trainer Danny Shum's champion was edged by the slimmest of margins by Soul Rush from Japan in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jockey James McDonald and the SAR's runners were among the leading pack for much of the 1,800 metre Grade One course, and led almost the entire way after the turn.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they were overtaken by jockey Cristian Demuro's Soul Rush on virtually the last stride.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up his three-race trip in the Middle East, Romantic Warrior won the Jebel Hatta in Dubai and was also runner-up in the Saudi Cup in Riyadh.

 Nick Rockett, a 33-1 shot ridden by Patrick Mullins, won the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree on Saturday (April 5) in a top three sweep for horses trained by the Irish amateur jockey's father Willie.

  Last year's winner I Am Maximus finished second and Grangeclare West was third with another Mullins' horse Meetingofthewaters in fifth.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal's faint hopes of catching Premier League leaders Liverpool are almost over after their 1-1 draw at Everton, while Aston Villa bolstered their bid for Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Leandro Trossard's opener for the Gunners was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye's penalty to leave Arsenal trailing 11 points behind Liverpool, who travel to Fulham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool need just 11 points from their remaining eight games to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title and first since 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just two wins in their last six league matches, Arsenal have tamely surrendered in the title race and are destined to go another year without their first English crown since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid would be to win at Goodison Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a very tough place to come, a team who is very physical and direct. If you don't deal with it, it's hard to get momentum. The start of the second half was very poor," Arteta said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's weakened line-up struck first in the 34th minute when Raheem Sterling picked out Trossard and his low shot took Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford by surprise as it squirmed into the net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton were unable to stop Liverpool's march to the title in midweek when they lost 1-0 in the Merseyside derby at Anfield.
  <br>
  <br>
  David Moyes' men did their arch rivals another favour as they drew level in the 49th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Lewis-Skelly fouled Jack Harrison and Ndiaye stroked home from the penalty spot four minutes into the second period to put Liverpool within touching distance of the title.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Villa Park, Unai Emery's side climbed into sixth as early goals from Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen saw off third-placed Forest, who got one back through Jota Silva.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's seventh consecutive victory in all competitions was the ideal preparation for Wednesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A top-five Premier League finish will almost certainly be enough for Villa to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa sit below fifth-placed Manchester City on goal difference and within one point of Chelsea in fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves effectively sealed their survival and left Ipswich on the brink of relegation with a 2-1 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vitor Pereira's side trailed to Liam Delap's 16th-minute goal as the striker swept in Dara O'Shea's knockdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Pablo Sarabia drilled into the bottom corner to haul Wolves level in the 72nd minute, before Jorgen Strand Larsen prodded home on 84 minutes for his fourth goal in his last three games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fourth-bottom Wolves are 12 points clear of third-bottom Ipswich with just seven games left, leaving Kieran McKenna's side almost certain to return to the Championship after just one season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves' victory also means bottom of the table Southampton will be relegated if they lose at Tottenham on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite finishing with nine men in a bruising battle featuring three red cards at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  FA Cup semi-finalists Palace went ahead thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's third minute curler, before Danny Welbeck's close-range effort in the 31st minute dragged Brighton level.
  <br>
  <br>
  Daniel Munoz blasted Palace's winner in the 55th minute, but the Eagles had to dig deep for the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palace striker Eddie Nketiah was sent off for two bookings in the space of nine minutes, then team-mate Marc Guehi was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card in the 90th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a frantic finale, Brighton's Jan Paul van Hecke was shown a red card for his foul on Daichi Kamada.

 Thomas Müller will leave Bayern Munich this summer after a 25-year career at the German club.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 35-year-old Müller said on Saturday, in a joint announcement with Bayern, that his “incredible journey” with his boyhood club will end in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  The midfielder's contract is set to expire after the season and he's seen limited game time.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s clear that today is not like any other day for me," Müller said. "My 25 years as an FC Bayern Munich player will come to an end in the summer. It’s been an incredible journey, shaped by unique experiences, great encounters and unforgettable triumphs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I feel immense gratitude and joy that I got to make this career with my beloved club. The special connection to the club and our fantastic fans will always remain. What I want as a farewell should be clear: titles we can celebrate together, and moments we’ll remember fondly for a long time.” (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time world champion Max Verstappen smashed the track record to snatch pole position for Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix ahead of McLaren's Lando Norris, as Yuki Tsunoda qualified a lowly 15th on his Red Bull debut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen clocked a blistering lap of 1min 26.983sec in his Red Bull, 0.012sec ahead of championship leader Norris, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen set a new Suzuka track record with his final lap in Saturday's qualifying, pipping Norris right at the death.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Each session we kept making little improvements, then the last lap was flat out," said Verstappen, who has won the Japanese GP for the last three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a Formula One car around here is insane. This is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was Verstappen's first pole position of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dutchman is still looking for his first grand prix win of the new campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was fourth ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli sixth and RB's Isack Hadjar seventh.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton was eighth, followed by Williams's Alex Albon and Haas's Oliver Bearman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Norris is looking for his second grand prix win of the season, after triumphing in the season opener in Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished second behind Piastri in China a fortnight ago in a dominant start to the campaign for McLaren.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm happy, congrats to Max, he did a good job," said Norris.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have to credit something when it is a lap that good that he must have done. I got everything out of the car today, the gaps are tiny.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Good but not enough."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsunoda was eliminated in Q2 in a disappointing first qualifying drive for Red Bull after being promoted in place of Liam Lawson last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese driver finished one place behind Lawson, who returned to RB after just two races for Red Bull in a ruthless driver swap.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen has not looked comfortable this week and he again complained to his team over the radio in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still have the same problem, the tyres are not gripping on the front," the Dutchman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alpine's Pierre Gasly, Williams's Carlos Sainz and Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso were eliminated in Q2 along with Lawson and Tsunoda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sauber pair Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto, Haas's Esteban Ocon, Alpine's Jack Doohan and Aston Martin's Lance Stroll were all eliminated in Q1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doohan's practice on Friday ended when he crashed heavily into a barrier and mechanics had to work through the night to repair his badly damaged car.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualifying was suspended for about eight minutes in Q2 when a small trackside fire broke out as sparks from the cars ignited the grass in the dry conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the fifth such incident of the weekend, with the second and third practice sessions also disrupted by fires.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain has been forecast for Sunday's race. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 NHL career goals on Friday, matching a mark that once seemed unassailable.
 <br>
  <br>
  With Gretzky in attendance, the 39-year-old Russian delivered No. 894 6:32 into the third quarter to give his Washington Capitals a 4-3 lead over the Chicago Blackhawks in a game they would go on to win 5-3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin tied Gretzky's monumental mark with a power-play goal, dropping to one knee and lifting his arms in celebration as the crowd at Capital One Arena roared.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm sure everybody enjoyed this moment because it's something special," Ovechkin said in an in-arena interview immediately after the game. "(To) do it at home, in front of our fans, family, friends, and obviously win here as well ... It's a huge honor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin also skated over and high-fived his son Sergei, with teammates coming onto the ice to congratulate him.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It means a lot," Ovechkin said. "Right now it's so emotional. You never thought, like, you can reach that milestone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Without all my teammates, all my partners, you guys," he said with a nod to fans, "my family, my mom, my wife, you know? They support, they do everything what I need."
  <br>
  <br>
  Needing three goals to break Gretzky's monumental mark coming into the contest, he had grabbed number 893 just 3:52 into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Set up at the bottom of the right faceoff circle, Ovechkin one-timed a pass from Dylan Strome past Blackhawks goaltender Spencer Knight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a good flat pass (from Strome) and I got lucky," Ovechkin said in a brief television interview during the first intermission. "It hit the post and went in."
  <br>
  <br>
  The goal gave Ovechkin his 14th 40-goal season, extending his own record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky was in attendance, and Ovechkin said after the first period that the presence of the Canadian great added to an electric atmosphere at Washington's Capital One Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's buzzing right now," he said. "Wayne's here, so it's a special moment."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fans were chanting for Ovechkin before the game started, and every time he was on the ice.
  <br>
  <br>
  A groan went up in the first period when a pass intended for Ovechkin was intercepted by a Chicago defender.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gretzky, sitting in a suite with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, also drew cheers from the crowd.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blackhawks, trailing 4-3, pulled their goaltender, but after Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net to put the Caps up 5-3 Knight returned to his goal -- and took Ovechkin on.
  <br>
  <br>
  He stopped two attempts from the Russian for a record-breaking goal as the clock wound down, drawing boos from spectators for his trouble.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ovechkin's next chance to break the mark will come Sunday, when the Capitals play at the New York Islanders.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he did break another record Friday, his 136th game-winning goal breaking the record he shared with Jaromir Jagr. (AFP)

    Van der Poel and Pogacar face off in Tour of Flanders

<img alt="There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Come rain or shine 750,000 fans are expected to turn out on Sunday for cycling's most revered one-day race, the Tour of Flanders, for a Tadej Pogacar and Mathieu van der Poel showdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder Pogacar won the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and world championships in 2024, while Van der Poel, who is 10 kilos heavier than the Slovenian, is the most powerful one-day racer, and has multiple mountain bike and cyclocross titles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar has also confirmed he will ride the Paris-Roubaix with its 54km of cobbles and no hills in next Sunday's big one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won both last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each has seven wins in the Monuments and last time the two went head-to-head Van der Poel came out on top at Milan - San Remo in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Mathieu is one of the best sprinters in the peloton," said the effervescent Pogacar. "Flanders is a very different race. But if there's a sprint, I'll do my best."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Pogacar won here in 2023, Van der Poel is one of seven men to have won it three times and could become the first to win a fourth.
  <br>
  <br>
  In this epic 270km struggle through lush Flemish plains, Van der Poel's weight might be an advantage for the distance and the 18 cobbled sections.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the slighter Pogacar, there are 17 short, punchy hills where he can exercise his devastating kick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Belgian hopes would normally rest on Wout van Aert. He has struggled to find any form since a win at the Vuelta last year but Pogacar is not ruling him out.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Wout seems pretty good to me. He's on the pace," Pogacar said. "He'll be in there on Sunday."
  <br>
  <br>
  Denmark's Mads Pedersen and Filippo Ganna of Ineos are two other on-form riders to watch out for.
  <br>
  <br>
  First staged in 1913 the Tour of Flanders was designed to reflect the stoicism of the Flemish. The winner is often a tough, tactically-minded rider ready to give every last drop for victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Van der Poel won the 2020, 2022 and 2024 Flanders and has twice been runner-up, but after winning the Milan - San Remo in March he picked out Pogacar as favourite for this one.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many more hills here for him to attack on. It'll be hard, but then it always is," said the 30-year-old Dutch phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the 114km mark, there is a cobbled hill every 8km or so, constantly whittling down the field which will start with 25 teams of seven.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each hillside in the latter part of the race is turned into a giant makeshift party pub, with beer tents and food caravans before an after-party that goes on late into the night.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pogacar said of his 2023 win he could retire happy after soloing home thanks to a series of devastating attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He opted not to defend his title in 2024 to target an elusive Giro-Tour double last achieved by the late Marco Pantini in 1998.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are five ultra-long one-day bike races known as the Monuments, and the Tour of Flanders is considered the greatest because of the constant steep, narrow climbs coupled with crowds that even a 100 years ago began to tip over half a million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The other four Monuments are Milan-San Remo, which calls for patience, the mudfest of Paris-Roubaix with its perilous rough-hewn cobbles, Liege-Bastogne-Liege through the winding forested lanes of the Ardennes, and the Tour of Lombardy which is a climbers' classic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shuttle buses and extra trains have been laid on throughout Flanders for what is regarded by many as an unofficial world championship. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne confirmed on Friday that he will leave the club at the end of the season.
 <br>
  <br>
  De Bruyne, 33, has won 14 major trophies since joining City from Wolfsburg in 2015, including six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nothing about this is easy to write, but as football players, we all know this day eventually comes. That day is here – and you deserve to hear it from me first," De Bruyne said in a post on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Football led me to all of you - and to this city. Chasing my dream, not knowing this period would change my life. This City. This club. These people... gave me EVERYTHING. I had no choice but to give EVERYTHING back! And guess what – we won everything."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Belgian international has been instrumental in City's rise to the dominant force in English football.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was twice crowned players' player of the year in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 and is second in the Premier League's all-time standings for assists on 118.
  <br>
  <br>
  His contract is due to expire at the end of June, but it remains unclear whether he will continue to see out his days as a City player at the Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 until July 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Every story comes to an end, but this has definitely been the best chapter," De Bruyne added. "Let's enjoy these last moments together!" (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 One of the National Games test events – the Hong Kong International Track Cup – will be held from April 19 to 21, attracting professional cyclists from around the world.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-day event will be held at the Hong Kong Velodrome in Tseung Kwan O, involving about 150 cyclists from over ten countries and regions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chairman of the organising committee, Steve Nip, said it is also the first time that 50 cyclists from local affiliated clubs will be invited to participate in elite and junior races.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Audiences can enjoy races involving world-class cyclists, and also cheer for cyclists from local affiliated clubs. I hope they can achieve good results with the advantage of racing at their home track," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pui Kwan-kay, the vice president of the Cycling Association of Hong Kong, China, also expressed hope for local cyclists.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This provides the opportunity for the Hong Kong team and young cyclists from local affiliated clubs to showcase their skills," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public can also watch races of a high standard, and they can treat this as a warm-up for the National Games at the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  SAR cyclist Ceci Lee, who will participate in the race, said she will step up training in the coming two weeks, especially on her sprinting skills, and she hopes she can achieve good results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local cyclist, Mow Ching-yin expects his condition to improve gradually as it is getting closer to the National Games, and he said he will focus on improving his endurance and speed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Standard tickets for the Track Cup can be had for HK$50, while a concession ticket costs HK$30.

<img alt="Spurs boss Ange Postecoglu had to endure chants of " src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798934_1_20250404151409.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea climbed to fourth place in the Premier League as Enzo Fernandez sealed a 1-0 win that piled pressure on beleaguered Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Fernandez's thumping header early in the second half settled a bruising London derby at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Manchester City and Newcastle had both won on Wednesday to knock Chelsea from fourth down to sixth in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chelsea's response lifted them one point clear of fifth-placed City and two ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four are guaranteed to reach the Champions League, with fifth also likely to secure a place depending on the results of the English clubs left in European competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea, who have now lost just one of their past 13 league games against Tottenham, had been far from convincing recently, with boss Enzo Maresca criticised for his cautious tactics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beaten 1-0 at Arsenal in their last game before the international break, Chelsea's players had a planned day off cancelled by Maresca due to a poor effort shown during an informal match against one of the club's youth sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were more dynamic against Tottenham, but still lacked a cutting edge despite holding on for a fifth win in their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  For Postecoglou, it was another dispiriting loss in a wretched season that could end with his sacking.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham are without a victory in their last four league matches and have won only one of their last six games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners are languishing in 14th place after a 16th defeat from 30 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last time they finished as low as 14th was in 2003-04, while their worst final position in the Premier League era was 15th in 1993-94.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham fans have grown increasingly frustrated with their side's decline, staging a series of protests against chairman Daniel Levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  They turned on Postecoglou as well during the second half, chanting "you don't know what you're doing" at the Australian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham's last chance of ending their 17-year trophy drought and fulfilling Postecoglou's boast that he always wins a major prize in his second season lies in the Europa League, where they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea almost made the perfect start inside the first minute when Trevoh Chalobah's pass reached Nicolas Jackson, whose shot was saved by Guglielmo Vicario and hit Van de Ven before bouncing off the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Blues were on top in the opening minutes, and Malo Gusto's blast flashed just wide from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vicario had to smother the ball on the goal-line after Fernandez tried to bundle home from Cole Palmer's deflected cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maresca had urged Jadon Sancho to provide more cutting edge amid mounting criticism of the winger's spluttering form during his loan from Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sancho nearly rose to Maresca's challenge with a curling effort that Vicario brilliantly tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham defender Cristian Romero pushed Levi Colwill to the ground in a clash that sparked a mass confrontation on the stroke of half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The row seemed to fire up Chelsea, and they finally made the breakthrough in the 50th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Palmer's cross picked out Fernandez, and the Argentine powered his header past Vicario from five yards.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Postecoglou sent on Brennan Johnson and Pape Sarr for Wilson Odobert and Lucas Bergvall, Tottenham fans taunted the Australian with derisive chants.
  <br>
  <br>
  For a few moments, it seemed Sarr had silenced Postecoglou's critics as he drilled home from long range in the 69th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the goal was disallowed by VAR for Sarr's foul on Moises Caicedo, leaving Postecoglou shaking his head in frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Son Heung-min was inches away from rescuing Postecoglou in the 89th minute, only for Robert Sanchez to make a superb save from the forward's close-range shot. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States is the sole bidder for the 2031 Women's World Cup, and the United Kingdom is set to host the 2035 tournament, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the Uefa Congress in Belgrade, Infantino said the only bid for 2031 was "from the USA and potentially some other Concacaf members together, and 2035 is from Europe, from the home nations."
  <br>
  <br>
  Infantino also said Fifa planned to increase the number of participating teams at the Women's World Cup from 32 teams to 48 in time for the 2031 tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's announcement comes after the football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland revealed last month that they would submit an expression of interest in staging the tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  World football's governing body last month said it would only welcome bids for 2035 from Europe or Africa, saying that the identity of the hosts would be confirmed at a Fifa Congress in the second quarter of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States – who are co-hosting with Mexico and Canada the 2026 men's World Cup – also confirmed in early March that it would push ahead with a bid for 2031.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Africa and Morocco had also been in the running with African nations invited to bid too, but Infantino's comments suggest they are now out of the running.
  <br>
  <br>
  The next Women's World Cup will take place in Brazil in 2027. (AFP)

<img alt="Jannik Sinner's running afoul of anti-doping rules has been blamed on former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi by physical trainer Umberto Ferrara.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tennis world number one Jannik Sinner's former physical trainer Umberto Ferrara said on Thursday he was blameless in the case of the three-time Grand Slam champion testing positive twice for a banned substance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Sinner received a three-month ban agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in February after "admitting "partial responsibility" for team mistakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara, in his first public remarks on the scandal, laid the blame squarely at the door of Sinner's former physiotherapist Giacomo Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both of them have been laid off by the 23-year-old since the affair came to light.
  <br>
  <br>
  WADA came to an agreement with Sinner after accepting he was inadvertently contaminated with the banned substance clostebol by Naldi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara told Gazzetta dello Sport that he had used the spray himself for years after it was prescribed by a doctor for an illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I suggested Naldi use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ferrara said he did not know Naldi had been gloveless and also not washed his hands after using the spray when he treated Sinner, especially after "the warnings he had given him".
  <br>
  <br>
  "With hindsight, it is easy to say I would not do things the same way," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course I am not proud of the behaviour of others."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have suffered during this affair owing to the bad faith of some," added Ferrara, who has since joined the entourage of 2021 Wimbledon finalist Matteo Berrettini.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open, the second Grand Slam event of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be Sinner's second tournament after his return as he will also compete on home soil at the Italian Open in Rome from May 7-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  The reigning US and Australian Open champion Sinner reached the French Open semi-finals last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's tournament is scheduled to run from May 25 until June 8. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China, women's cycling team rode their way to victory at the three-day women's Tour of Thailand, while rising star Ceci Lee claimed second place in the individual general classification.
 <br>
  <br>
  Lee, Leung Wing-yee, Leung Bo-yee, Yang Qianyu and Kwan Tsz-kwan finished in an overall time of 19 hours, 43 minutes and 37 seconds, tying with the host nation’s Thai team.
  <br>
  <br>
  The title was ultimately awarded to Hong Kong based on superior stage placings across the race.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hervé Dagorne, head coach of cycling at the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), said the team worked very hard on every stage, and their win is a huge encouragement ahead of the National Games in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They bring together a team spirit that will help when we stay together back in Hong Kong, so that is really helpful," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee, 23, showcased her growing prowess by securing second place in the individual standings.
  <br>
  <br>
  She claimed runner-up finishes in the first two stages and third in the final stage, narrowly edged out by Thailand’s Jutatip Maneephan, who dominated with a clean sweep of all three stages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee earned the white jersey, awarded to the tour’s best young rider.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dagorne said that Lee is "a talented cycling rider, but sometimes she misses confidence and it affects her decision or strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a long talk before she left and she was ready for a new start, especially after the disappointment in the Olympics last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "She has been working on herself and she's still so strong that she makes good decisions  and she has the support of a team.

  <br>
  "She also has the support of a new coach, Ben Kersten, who joined HKSI one month ago, so this combination [brought] her to this result."
  <br>
  <br>
  The team now shifts focus to the National Games track cycling test event, set to take place in Hong Kong from April 19 to 21.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Miami Heat ended Boston's nine-game NBA winning streak with a 124-103 victory that pushed the reigning champion Celtics further behind Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who rallied to beat New York.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 25 points to lead seven players to score in double figures for the Heat, who fought off a late Celtics surge to notch a sixth straight victory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston connected on just 37.2 percent of their shots in the first half in the face of stout Miami defense and Miami pushed their lead to 22 points early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Celtics, led by 24 points from Jaylen Brown, cut the deficit to three, but Miami had pushed it back to 10 entering the fourth quarter. After the Celtics pulled within four early in the final frame the Heat relentlessly pulled away again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory solidified Miami's position in the Eastern Conference play-in while the Celtics fell five games behind the Cavaliers atop the conference with six games left in the regular-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 on impressive 10-of-11 shooting for the Cavs, who rallied from an early 15-point deficit to beat the Knicks 124-105 in Cleveland.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks, third in the East, were again without top scoring threat Jalen Brunson, who missed his 14th game with a sprained ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even without him the Knicks were on a three-game winning streak, but after leading by as many as 15 points on the way to a 60-53 halftime lead New York ran out of gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  New York's OG Anunoby made five of six from three-point range on the way to 19 first-half points, but scored just four in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns led the Knicks with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but after closing the first half on a 10-2 scoring run the Cavaliers out-scored the Knicks 38-25 in the third quarter to seize control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't put our best foot forward at the start," Mitchell said. "We came out kind of sloppy. For the rest of the game, the last three quarters, we did what we were supposed to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mitchell added six rebounds, five assists and three of Cleveland's five blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Just trying to do everything I can to win," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Knicks remained three games ahead of the fourth-placed Indiana Pacers, who were fueled by 22 points and 10 assists from Tyrese Haliburton in a 110-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top six finishers in each conference qualify automatically for the playoffs, while the seventh- through 10th-placed teams will battle through the play-in tournament for the final two spots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Houston Rockets clinched their first playoff spot in five years in emphatic style, beating the league-worst Utah Jazz 143-105. (AFP)

    Barca oust Atlético, set up Clasico Copa del Rey final

<img alt="Ferran Torres celebrates scoring the opening goal during the Spanish Copa del Rey semi-final second leg. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798723_1_20250403061233.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Barcelona will face rivals Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final after Ferran Torres secured them a 1-0 win at Atlético Madrid, progressing 5-4 on aggregate from the semi-final tie.
 <br>
  <br>
  Record 31-time winners Barca had the better of the clash at the Metropolitano stadium after the wild 4-4 first leg draw, and defeat leaves Diego Simeone's Atlético with little to play for in the rest of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  By contrast the Catalans are on the hunt for a potential quadruple and are unbeaten in 2025, stretching their run to 21 games without defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Atlético were the last team to triumph against Barcelona, winning before Christmas to go top of La Liga, but they now trail Hansi Flick's team by nine points with nine matches remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can't relax, we have to keep believing and working, with humility and I'm sure good things will come," Torres said. "If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival."
  <br>
  <br>
  Flick brought winger Raphinha back into Barcelona's starting line-up and the hosts tried to shut him down through fair means or foul.
  <br>
  <br>
  César Azpilicueta was booked for one tackle, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also cautioned for going in hard on the Brazilian.
  <br>
  <br>
  Teenage winger Lamine Yamal ran the show on the other flank for Barcelona, firing wide and teeing up Jules Kounde, who bypassed Robin Le Normand with some neat juggling before lashing over.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 17-year-old played in Torres for Barcelona's opener with a well-weighted pass, finished clinically by the former Manchester City forward, who has earned more minutes with his recent performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yamal mishit a shot himself from a good position in the box, while Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso denied Raphinha at his near post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Simeone brought on Alexander Sorloth among three changes at the break, after he scored three goals in the three previous meetings between these sides this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps convinced he would make it four in four, Sorloth fired narrowly wide early in the second half with Antoine Griezmann open and ready for a simple finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end, Raphinha forced another save from Musso but was himself guilty of not squaring for Fermín López.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sorloth rattled home what he thought for a few seconds was an equaliser, but he had strayed offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Atlético ascendant, Flick brought on top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski for Torres, but the Polish veteran struggled to get involved.
  <br>
  <br>
  With four minutes of stoppage time added on Atlético turned the screw, with Musso coming up for a late De Paul free-kick, but Barcelona held off the hosts to progress. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stuttgart set up a German Cup final clash with third-division Arminia Bielefeld after a 3-1 win over RB Leipzig.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under the watchful eyes of Jurgen Klopp, the new head of global soccer for Leipzig's owners Red Bull, the visitors were outclassed by a strong Stuttgart side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Goals from Angelo Stiller, Nick Woltemade and Jamie Leweling took Stuttgart to victory, putting them on track for a first German Cup triumph since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The victory continues Stuttgart's rise since former Leipzig youth-team coach Sebastian Hoeness took over in April 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're going to Berlin," Hoeness said. "Unbelievable. The lads are unbelievable, it's incredible. It's a dream to travel to Berlin."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We rewarded ourselves with goals at the right moment and when we needed to we defended with passion," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach ended his post-match interview early before sprinting across the field to have his picture taken with the rest of the squad in front of the club's ecstatic home fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hoeness has become one of the most sought-after coaches in Europe, having led Stuttgart from relegation candidates to runners-up last season, and now the German Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-time German champions and three-time cup winners will be heavy favourites in Berlin in May, against a Bielefeld side who stunned holders Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, winners of two of the past three German Cups, had a chaotic lead-up to the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the Saxons fired coach Marco Rose, who led them to the trophy two seasons ago, replacing him with interim boss Zsolt Low.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp, a close friend of Rose who brought him to the club while coaching Mainz in 2002 but who signed off on Sunday's decision, was spotted watching on from the stands on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stiller put the hosts on track five minutes in, smacking home an unstoppable volley from outside the box to give Stuttgart the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig were stunned but took control soon after. Visiting striker Lois Openda was kept at bay despite three clear chances between the 15 and 35-minute marks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Woltemade doubled Stuttgart's lead 12 minutes into the second half, sliding the ball under the goalkeeper after a clever one-two with Ermedin Demirovic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig hit back almost immediately when Sesko hammered in with 62 minutes gone after beating the offside trap.
  <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were in the ascendancy and an equaliser looked likely until Woltemade headed goalwards from a Stiller cross, with the ball bouncing to Leweling who tapped in from two yards out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three-time winners Stuttgart have not qualified for the final since 2013, when they lost to a treble-bound Bayern, and last won in 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2009 and promoted to the top flight for the first time in 2016, Leipzig had previously won four from four German Cup semi-finals. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved closer to the Premier League title with a 1-0 win in the Merseyside derby against Everton, while Manchester City beat Leicester 2-0 to bolster their bid to reach the Champions League.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just eight games left, Liverpool sit 12 points clear of second-placed Arsenal, who beat Fulham 2-1 on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side had lost their previous two games in the League Cup final against Newcastle and the Champions League last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they got back on track in their march towards a record-equalling 20th English title and first since 2020 in Slot's maiden season in charge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having gone over two months without a goal, Diogo Jota was Liverpool's hero as he ended his drought in the 57th minute, slotting home from Luis Díaz's flick.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an especially sweet win for Liverpool after their stormy 2-2 draw at Everton in February, which featured a last-gasp equaliser for David Moyes' team.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the Etihad Stadium, City coped just fine without Norway striker Erling Haaland, who will be sidelined for up to seven weeks after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's men took just two minutes to go in front against second-bottom Leicester, who have lost seven successive league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeremy Doku and Savinho combined to carve open the Leicester defence before Jack Grealish slotted home from close range for his first league goal since December 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Grealish's long-awaited goal was missed by hundreds of City fans, who stayed outside the stadium for the first nine minutes in protest at the club's deal with a third-party ticket resale company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The protestors did get to see City double their advantage in the 29th minute as Egypt forward Omar Marmoush lashed home after Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen made a hash of dealing with Ruben Dias's pass.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are up to fourth place, one point ahead of fifth-placed Newcastle and two in front of sixth-placed Chelsea, who face Tottenham in their game in hand on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The top four qualify for the Champions League automatically, while fifth place is likely to also provide a berth in Europe's elite club competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle beat Brentford 2-1 to maintain the party mood after the prolonged celebrations of their first major trophy for 56 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Howe's side were back in action for the first time since beating Liverpool in the League Cup final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak met Jacob Murphy's cross with a typically predatory strike in first-half stoppage time at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford levelled through Bryan Mbeumo's 66th-minute penalty after Newcastle keeper Nick Pope tripped Yoane Wissa.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sandro Tonali lashed home from Harvey Barnes' assist in the 74th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Aston Villa also remain in the hunt for a Champions League place after winning 3-0 at Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford struck in the 51st minute, accelerating onto Morgan Rogers' pass for his third goal in his last two games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marco Asensio killed off Brighton in the 78th minute and Donyell Malen netted in added time to lift Villa into seventh place, two points behind Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Southampton wasted a chance to avoid becoming the worst team in Premier League history after a 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace at St Mary's. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stephen Curry scored 52 points and Draymond Green added a triple-double as the Golden State Warriors clinched a crucial 134-125 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry, the NBA's all-time leader in three-point shooting, once again demonstrated his long-range prowess, draining 12-of-20 attempts from outside the arc at Memphis's FedExForum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 37-year-old's dazzling shooting performance helped the Warriors vault over the Grizzlies into fifth place in the Western Conference standings, edging them closer to an automatic playoff berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Warriors improved to 44-31 while the Grizzlies dropped to sixth place with a 44-32 record. The top six finishers in the West qualify automatically for the postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's masterpiece – his second 50-point game of the season and the 15th of his career – was backed by a triple from defensive linchpin Green and 27 points from Jimmy Butler.
  <br>
  <br>
  Green finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Warriors coach Steve Kerr lavished praise on Curry's virtuoso display that has left Golden State firmly on course for the playoffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The guy's 37 years old, it's incredible," Kerr said. "Fifty-two points with people draped all over him all game long. The conditioning, the skill, the audacity, the belief, it's incredible to watch Steph at work. "I can't believe he's still doing this at this age. But he's put the work in and he's still got it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo, who took over the team last week following the shock dismissal of Taylor Jenkins, was similarly effusive of Curry's performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a sight to behold how he operates," Iisalo said, revealing that the team had been helpless to stop a first-quarter onslaught from Curry that included 19 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the first quarter we had a specific strategy that we do not want him to get three-point shots – and he found a way to get going anyway. It's very hard to stop a player of that caliber," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once he gets into that zone, it's very difficult to get him," he continued. "I mean, we're talking about the best movement shooter of all time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Memphis, who trailed by as many as 17 points in the first quarter, were left ruing their inability to sustain a second-half rally which saw them open up a four-point lead with just under four minutes remaining.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant led the Grizzlies' scoring with 36 points while Jaren Jackson Jr. added 22.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody's hurting in that locker room right now," Iisalo said. "It really hurts when you put everything on the line and you come up a little short. But that's life, that's sports."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 37 points as the Milwaukee Bucks snapped a four-game losing streak with a 133-123 victory over the Phoenix Suns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 39 points for Phoenix but it was not enough to prevent the Suns from falling to a fourth consecutive defeat – a late-season mini-slump that has imperiled their playoff hopes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Suns are now in 11th place in the West with a 35-41 record, trailing the 10th-placed Sacramento Kings (36-39). Teams ranked 7th to 10th in the conference standings advance to a four-team play-in tournament that determines the final two playoff tickets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Indiana Pacers became the latest team to clinch their playoff place after the Atlanta Hawks slumped to a 127-113 home defeat to the Portland Trail Blazers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result ensured that the Pacers, fourth in the Eastern Conference with a 44-31 record, are guaranteed a top-six finish. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Cup holders Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock 2-1 elimination at Arminia Bielefeld in the semi-finals of the competition.
 <br>
  <br>
  Xabi Alonso's side were heavily favoured to reach their second successive final but were outclassed from start to finish by their underdog opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jonathan Tah's 17th-minute goal was cancelled out by a Marius Woerl strike for the hosts three minutes later.
  <br>
  <br>
  Maximilian Grosser's goal in first-half stoppage time would prove the difference for Bielefeld, who have now beaten four top-division opponents on their way to the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld, who have never made a German Cup final, became just the fourth third-division team to reach the showpiece event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should Bielefeld win in Berlin in May – they will face either RB Leipzig or Stuttgart – the club will be rewarded with a Europa League spot next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't need luck at all because we were on the front foot the whole time," home coach Michel Kniat said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kniat said he "normally wouldn't have a drink with the players, but tonight I'll make an exception", adding that "nobody will go to sleep in this city tonight".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen's Robert Andrich said it was "by far our worst game of the season" and added that "Bielefeld deserved the win tonight, which means we did plenty of things wrong".
  <br>
  <br>
  Leverkusen coach Alonso came into the game having never lost in 10 matches in the competition and needed just one more victory to beat Louis van Gaal's all-time record set as Bayern Munich manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everything seemed to go according to plan when Leverkusen took the lead after 17 minutes, Tah tapping in unmarked at the far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts hit back almost immediately however, Woerl taking advantage of a sloppy clearance attempt by Piero Hincapie to curl the ball home.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the half wore on, Leverkusen were unable to make their possession count, with Bielefeld fast and threatening on the counter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts once again caught Leverkusen napping to take the lead moments before halftime, Grosser hammering in a Louis Oppie free kick from close range.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bielefeld continued to out-energise their opponents, fighting in the duels and giving Leverkusen few chances to drag themselves back into the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Patrick Schick, so often Leverkusen's late hero over the past two seasons, had a chance to level the scores while unmarked after 81 minutes but hit a header against the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year's German Cup is one of the more open in recent memory, with recent champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt all suffering early eliminations from the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, RB Leipzig play away at Stuttgart in the other semi-final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leipzig, who have won two of the past three German Cups, will be managed by interim coach Zsolt Low, who took over after Marco Rose was sacked on Sunday. (AFP)

<img alt="Antonio Rudiger, right, was among the scorers for Real Madrid. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%2F%2Fi3.wp.com%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798540_2_20250402062922.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid edged into the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling 4-4 draw against Real Sociedad after extra-time, securing a 5-4 aggregate semi-final victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Antonio Rudiger decided the pulsating tie with a header in the 115th minute, with Madrid to face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid in the final.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, took the lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Endrick's fine chip pulled the 20-time winners level.
  <br>
  <br>
  A David Alaba own goal and Mikel Oyarzabal's deflected effort helped La Real open up a lead on the Spanish champions but Madrid battled back with goals from Jude Bellingham and Aurelien Tchouameni.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oyarzabal grabbed his second in stoppage time to force extra-time but his side could not hold off Madrid until penalties, with Rudiger's header the final word.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very happy because it was a really hard game with many comebacks and in the end my goal," Rudiger said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For me (the goal) was easy, (I made a) good movement, the corner was very good and because of that we're in the final," he added. "It's a hard season but we're in another final and we will win it."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes back into his starting lineup, leaving Kylian Mbappé on the bench to rest, with Endrick taking his place in an all-Brazilian attack.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 18-year-old wonderkid striker who netted the only goal in the first leg, was active in the opening phases, sending a dangerous overhead kick narrowly wide of Álex Remiro's far post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bellingham also threatened for the hosts but it was Real Sociedad who took the lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barrenetxea broke in behind Lucas Vázquez to reach Pablo Marin's flick-on and drilled a low finish home to put the Basques level in the tie.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid soon found their equaliser. Vinicius played a sensational through ball down the left flank with the outside of his foot, sending Endrick in on goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The youngster, top scorer in the Copa del Rey, produced a gorgeous lobbed finish over Romero for his fifth in the competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad appealed for a penalty before the break when Takefusa Kubo went down in the box after being held by Vinicius, but the referee did not concur.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti brought on Mbappé for Endrick, looking for a goal to shut the tie down for good. However, it was the visitors who were creating the better chances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a superb save to deny Martin Zubimendi and Oyarzabal wastefully fired the rebound wide.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad moved ahead on the night when Alaba deflected Marin's cross through Lunin's legs and into his own net after 72 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Austrian defender, who returned from a long-term injury in January, was also involved in Real Sociedad's third, deflecting Oyarzabal's shot past Lunin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It sparked Madrid in to action, with Vinicius turning his marker brilliantly, driving forward and crossing for Bellingham to strike in the 82nd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four minutes later and Los Blancos pulled level on the night with Tchouameni's header badly fumbled by Remiro into his own net.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just when it seemed Real Sociedad were out they managed to force extra-time, with Oyarzabal heading home Sergio Gómez's free-kick in the 93rd minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Remiro saved well from Bellingham before the end of the regulation 90 minutes, with the pace slower, inevitably, as the game restarted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Sociedad's Jon Olagasti was booked for hacking down Vinicius as he threatened to escape on the left, with the visitors working hard to hold off the European champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  With five minutes remaining Rudiger sent Madrid through to the final with a fine header from Arda Guler's corner past the helpless Remiro.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday Atletico Madrid host Barcelona in the second leg of the other semi-final, with the teams level at 4-4 on aggregate. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nottingham Forest beat Manchester United 1-0 to close in on Champions League football next season as Bukayo Saka scored in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Fulham on his return from injury.
 <br>
  <br>
  Former United winger Anthony Elanga came back to haunt his former club with a stunning solo effort after just five minutes at the City Ground to earn all three points for Nuno Espirito Santo's side.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-placed Forest extend their lead over Newcastle in sixth to 10 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thanks to the strong performance of English sides in European competitions this season, the top five will almost certainly qualify for the Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest are two-time European champions but have not played in the continent's elite competition since they were holders in 1980.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elanga was discarded by United in 2023 after a bright start to his career at Old Trafford, but is one of many Forest success stories fulfilling his potential under Nuno.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swedish international collected possession deep inside his own half but showed blistering pace to burst into the United box before firing low past Andre Onana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just a year after battling to narrowly avoid relegation, Forest are enjoying an unexpected fairytale season that also includes progressing to the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  They had been forced through 120 minutes and penalties to beat Brighton in Saturday's quarter-final and were also without top scorer Chris Wood due to injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest fatigued in the second half, but United were undone by a familiar lack of cutting edge going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ruben Amorim resorted to sending on centre-back Harry Maguire as a makeshift striker in the closing stages and he nearly grabbed an equaliser in stoppage time when his shot was cleared off the line by Murillo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United remain without two consecutive Premier League wins all season with the Red Devils languishing down in 13th.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal maintained some pressure on leaders Liverpool by cutting the gap at the top to nine points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka stole the headlines by coming off the bench to head in on his first appearance since December 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikel Merino's deflected effort had given Arsenal a first-half lead. However, victory came at a cost as key defender Gabriel Magalhães limped off injured.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rodrigo Muniz pulled a goal back in stoppage time, but defeat is a blow to Fulham's ambitions of European football next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just one week away from the Gunners' Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid, the sight of Gabriel pulling up with a hamstring problem added to Mikel Arteta's injury woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal are already without forwards Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus due to season-ending injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Merino has proved an able deputy as a stand-in striker.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish midfielder took his tally to five goals in eight games in his new role, albeit with the aid of a big deflection to open the scoring on 37 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka's introduction was greeted with the biggest cheer of the night until that point at the Emirates Stadium when he replaced Ethan Nwaneri 25 minutes from time.
  <br>
  <br>
  The England international took just eight minutes to net his 10th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was in the right place to head in from close range after Gabriel Martinelli flicked on Merino's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the bottom of the table, Wolves pulled ever closer to survival with a 1-0 win over West Ham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jorgen Strand Larsen scored the only goal at Molineux as Wolves moved 12 points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

    Ng On-yee happy that billiards keep Tier A status

<img alt="Ng On-yee shows off her British Open trophy upon her return to Hong Kong.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China snooker star Ng On-yee said a decision by the government last week allowing billiards to retain its Tier A status will help the players as well as the sport's overall development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The SAR snooker queen returned to Hong Kong on Tuesday after defending her title at the British Open in Walsall, England with a hard-fought 4-3 victory over Mink Nutcharut of Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport, Ng said maintaining billiards' Tier A status not only provides important recognition for athletes, but also allows coaches to develop better training programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Two key factors allowed me to play more freely in this tournament – first, having already secured my World Snooker Tour qualification early, and second, knowing that snooker would maintain its status at the Sports Institute. These significantly reduced my pressure," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng added that the move will give more confidence to young athletes developing their careers.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also spoke about getting into the right frame of mind in the British Open final when her opponent rallied from a 3-0 deficit to force a decisive seventh and final frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I was leading 3-0, I started thinking just one more frame to win, and that's when I got a bit tight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After being pulled back to 3-3, I told myself to stop over-thinking – just treat it like the first frame again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Focus on taking every chance that comes, forget what's happened before, and concentrate completely on the current frame."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng will next play in the World Women’s Snooker Championship 2025 in Dongguan between May 20 and 27.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Veteran Al Horford turned back the clock to help the NBA champion Boston Celtics notch a ninth straight victory and nab a franchise first with a 117-103 win over the Grizzlies in Memphis.
 <br>
  <br>
  Horford, 38, led the Celtics scoring with 26 points off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum added 25 points and 14 rebounds and the Celtics defense stymied the Grizzlies in the second half to complete a perfect 6-0 road trip – the longest unbeaten road swing in the club's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boston, second in the Eastern Conference behind the Cleveland Cavaliers, won all six games by double digits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Horford scored his season-high, draining six of Boston's 21 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a lot of fun," Horford said. "It's pretty amazing for me to be in this position and I'm just trying to have fun with it and enjoy with my team."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ja Morant scored 26 points for the Grizzlies, who led by as many as 11 in the first half and regained the lead early in the third.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, however, they couldn't keep pace and lost ground in their fight with the Los Angeles Lakers for fourth place in the West.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Oklahoma City Thunder, already assured of the Western Conference top seed, racked up their 10th straight victory with a 145-117 pounding of the Chicago Bulls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaiah Joe came off the bench to score 31 points – leading seven Thunder players to score in double figures as Oklahoma City improved to 28-1 against Eastern Conference opponents – the NBA record for most wins by a team against an opposing conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We all have the same goal in mind," said Joe, who made eight of the Thunder's 23 three-pointers. "We know what we want to do at the end of the day and we know how to get there. We've just got to keep stacking days, stacking games."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers rallied from 16 points down in the third quarter to beat the Sacramento Kings 111-109 and maintain their grip on fourth place in the East.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 18 points and handed out 11 assists, drilling a three-pointer with just over one minute remaining that gave Indiana the lead for good.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Los Angeles Clippers, eighth in West but locked in a battle with Golden State and Minnesota for sixth place and direct entry to the playoffs, clawed out a gritty 96-87 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell scored 21 points each and Ivica Zubac added 18 points and 20 rebounds – including nine on the offensive end – to help the Clippers finally seize control in a game that featured 15 lead changes in the first three quarters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Paolo Banchero scored 26 points and Franz Wagner added 21 for the Magic, who remained in eighth place in the East.

 Hong Kong, China snooker player Ng On-yee on Monday defeated World No. 1 Mink Nutcharut of Thailand to defend her title at the British Open in Walsall, England.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ng's 4-3 victory is the SAR athlete's second ranking crown of the season, following her dominance at the US Women's Snooker Open in August last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The result also solidifies her hold on second place in the world rankings.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ng, 34, has now claimed 22 ranking titles since her maiden victory in 2012, when she won the Northern Championship without losing a frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was close to her best throughout the tournament, having scored four of the top five breaks – including a near-flawless century break of 113 during her quarter-final victory against compatriot So Man-yan on Sunday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major League Baseball has suspended Atlanta Braves slugger Jurickson Profar for 80 games after he tested positive for the performance-enhancing chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), MLB announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suspension of the 32-year-old outfielder is more bad news for an Atlanta team that has started the season 0-4.
  <br>
  <br>
  He signed a three-year, US$42 million deal with the Braves in January, and will be suspended through the end of June. Although he can return in July for the remainder of the regular season, Profar will not be eligible to play in the 2025 postseason.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were surprised and extremely disappointed to learn that Jurickson Profar tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Prevention and Treatment Program," the Braves said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar, who hit a career-high 24 home runs for the San Diego Padres last year, issued a statement through the MLB Players Association, calling the announcement "the most difficult day of my baseball career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Profar wrote in a statement that he tested positive in the off-season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to apologise to the entire Braves organisation, my teammates, and the fans," he said. He added that he "would never knowingly do anything to cheat" and that he "would never willingly take a banned substance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "But I take full responsibility and accept MLB's decision," he concluded. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City were dealt a major blow with leading scorer Erling Haaland set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering an ankle injury as the season reaches its climax.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 24-year-old Norwegian was injured in Sunday's 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win at Bournemouth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having just scored his 30th goal of the season to level the tie, he was then hurt in a challenge with Bournemouth midfielder Lewis Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League champions did not provide a timescale for the player's return.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The expectation is that Erling will be fit in time to play a further part in the remainder of this season, including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup," said a club statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Erling underwent initial tests in Manchester on Monday morning and will now seek specialist consultation to confirm the full extent of the injury. Assessment remains ongoing to ascertain a full prognosis," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are currently fifth in the Premier League and battling to ensure a spot in the Champions League next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pep Guardiola's side face matches against Leicester and Manchester United this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  They then have a visit from Crystal Palace and a trip to Everton before their FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, at Wembley on April 26. (AFP)
