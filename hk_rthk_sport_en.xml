<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Aston Villa wasted a chance to close the gap on the Premier League's top four as Tariq Lamptey's late equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Brighton.
 <br>
  <br>
  Villa striker Ollie Watkins celebrated his birthday with a goal and an assist for Morgan Rogers, putting his side ahead after Simon Adingra's early opener for Brighton.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unai Emery's men allowed Lamptey to level with just nine minutes left at Villa Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa's hopes of finishing in the top four for a second consecutive season are in danger of being extinguished well before the spring after the latest erratic display in an inconsistent season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ninth-placed Villa are six points adrift of the top four, while 10th-placed Brighton's winless run has reached seven games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls took a 12th-minute lead with a goal that encapsulated Villa's sloppy form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ezri Konsa failed to deal with Lewis Dunk's long ball over the top and it fell to Adingra, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa could have been two down before the half-hour as Emiliano Martínez was forced into a full-stretch save to keep out Julio Enciso's shot before Jan Paul van Hecke put a free header wide from the resulting corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts finally came to life and levelled after a frantic period which saw two VAR checks for penalties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first came after Rogers appeared to be chopped down by Van Hecke, but VAR official Stuart Attwell did not think there was enough evidence to overrule referee Craig Dawson's on-field decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the corner there was more drama as Rogers was kicked by João Pedro after Seagulls goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen flapped.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dawson initially did not award a spot-kick but eventually changed his mind after viewing the pitchside monitor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins stepped up to convert the spot-kick for his eighth goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Villa needed just 72 seconds in the second half to go in front as Rogers grabbed his sixth goal of the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins turned provider as his lofted pass from a recycled corner played in his England team-mate, who fired into the bottom corner.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Villa couldn't press home their advantage and paid the price in the 81st minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lamptey started the raid with a lung-bursting run before collecting Kaoru Mitoma's pass to fire home in emphatic style.
  <br>
  <br>
  Watkins had two opportunities to win it but wasted both, leaving Emery holding his head in frustration after he lashed over in the final seconds. (AFP)

    Chelsea rocked by Ipswich; Man Utd lose 4th straight

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chelsea's bid to climb back into the Premier League title race suffered a major blow as lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road.
 <br>
  <br>
  Enzo Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things," Maresca said. "It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are," he added. "It's a long race."
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic," McKenna said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone involved with Ipswich can enjoy a glass of sparkly stuff tomorrow night and think about some of the moments we've had over the last couple of years," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a 2024 to forget with a fourth consecutive defeat as Newcastle cruised to a 2-0 win at Old Trafford to intensify the scrutiny on Red Devils' boss Ruben Amorim.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just two months into his tenure, Amorim conceded this week that his job is on the line unless results begin to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Portuguese has won just two of his first nine league games to leave United languishing down in 14th, just seven points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak and Joelinton struck inside the first 19 minutes as a fifth consecutive win lifted the Magpies into fifth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Marcus Rashford had been restored to the United squad for the first time in five games but remained on the bench for the full 90 minutes as Amorim turned to another outcast in Alejandro Garnacho to make a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Argentine international was introduced just as Newcastle had ridden the storm and began to assert their control once more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A third consecutive home league defeat for the first time since 1979 is the latest in the list of sorry statistics that have marked United's decade of decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That is really clear so we have to fight," said Amorim on United being dragged into a relegation battle.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a really difficult moment, one of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United and we have to address it with honesty," he added. "We have to fight in the next game."
  <br>
  <br>
  The fear for Amorim is that the losing run only looks set to continue into 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  A daunting trip to runaway league leaders Liverpool awaits on Sunday before United travel to Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. (AFP)

    Haliburton leads Pacers over Celtics; Magic hang on

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton scored 31 points as the Pacers turned the tables on the NBA champion Celtics with a confident 123-114 victory in Boston.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two days after Jaylen Brown's 44 points propelled the Celtics to a 142-105 blowout victory over the Pacers, Indiana got their revenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haliburton added six rebounds and seven assists without a turnover and six players scored in double figures for Indiana, whose lights-out shooting in the second quarter saw them seize a seven-point halftime lead that they would push to as many as 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown stayed hot, delivering 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting with six assists. Jayson Tatum added 22 points with nine rebounds and six assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard scored 17 points each for Indiana, with Nembhard adding eight rebounds and eight assists as he returned after missing Friday's game with left knee tendinitis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nembhard said maintaining their pace in the fourth quarter – when Boston cut an 11-point deficit to two with seven and a half minutes to play, was key for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that was the biggest thing we did late in the game," he said. "We kept pace in the game. We didn't slow it down and worry about the score too much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Orlando, Cole Anthony drove for the game-winning layup as the Magic erased a 21-point deficit to beat the Brooklyn Nets 102-101.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rookie Tristan da Silva scored 21 points to lead the injury-ravaged Magic. Goga Bitadze added 19 and Anthony scored five of his 10 in the fourth quarter, as Orlando closed the game on a 22-4 scoring run.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cam Thomas, back after missing 13 games with a hamstring strain, came off the bench and led Brooklyn's scoring with 25 points but missed a jump shot as time expired.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony admitted that da Silva, who scored 13 points in the fourth quarter, was supposed to get the ball on the play that yielded his game winner.
  <br>
  <br>
  When that failed to pan out, he said, "I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go get a layup".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nets were without veteran Dorian Finney-Smith, who was traded along with Shake Milton to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a deal that sent D'Angelo Russell back to Brooklyn. (AFP)

    Eagles clinch NFC East title with rout of Dallas

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East division title after handing the Dallas Cowboys a humiliating 41-7 defeat, while the Buffalo Bills secured the second seed in the AFC with a 40-14 crushing of the New York Jets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cowboys were already eliminated from playoff contention and without top receiver CeeDee Lamb with a shoulder injury, but it was their defence that struggled.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles starting quarter-back Jalen Hurts missed the game due to concussion. Kenny Pickett got the start but had to leave the game in the third quarter with a rib injury with Philadelphia 24-7 up.
  <br>
  <br>
  That meant third-choice Tanner McKee took over under the centre and two of his four passes were for touchdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real damage to the Cowboys, who gave up four turnovers, was done by the Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley who put up 167 yards on 31 carries to pass the 2,000 yard mark for the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barkley, who has 2,005 yards needs to put up 101 yards next week to break Eric Dickerson's record for the most rushing yards in a season, set for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It’s cool, I’m not going to downplay it," Barkley said of the division crown. “At the end of the day, you’re not getting remembered for being a 2024 NFC East division champ.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The win means the Eagles are guaranteed at least the number two seed in the NFC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Bills took the second seed in the AFC behind defending champions Kansas City Chiefs, after taking care of business against the New York Jets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills led 12-0 at the half before their quarterback Josh Allen took total control of the game with touchdown passes to Amari Cooper and Keon Coleman either side of a rushing score from James Cook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who threw for 182 yards, had opened the scoring with a one-yard rush.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw two interceptions and was sacked four times.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying," he added. "But it had no effect on us.” (AFP/AP)

    Liverpool crush West Ham; Forest climb to second

<img alt="Liverpool's Diogo Jota celebrates scoring the side's fifth goal with Harvey Elliott and Mohamed Salah. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785405_1_20241230050629.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rampant Liverpool smashed West Ham 5-0 on Sunday to stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League to eight points as Manchester City returned to winning ways at troubled Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to second in the table with a fifth straight win at Everton, while Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham conceded late to draw 2-2 against Vitor Pereira's rejuvenated Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's Liverpool look unstoppable in their quest for a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title, recording their 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luis Diaz opened the scoring against Julen Lopetegui's hapless team on the half-hour, before Mohamed Salah set up Cody Gakpo for the second with some audacious footwork.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Egypt international then scored his 20th goal of the season shortly before half-time to put the visitors in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 4-0 with a deflected shot from distance in the 54th minute and Diogo Jota completed the rout, courtesy of another Salah assist following a surging run.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy," said Slot, flying in his first season in the Anfield hotseat after replacing Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's striking success has come against the background of mounting speculation over the futures of Salah, Alexander-Arnold and captain Virgil van Dijk.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three can discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer from January 1 but remain focused on winning a second Premier League title together.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The only thing on my mind is I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of that," Salah told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will do my best for the team to win the trophy. There are a few other teams catching up with us and we need to stay focused and humble."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, defending champions City travelled to relegation-threatened Leicester drained of confidence after just one win in all competitions since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their frailties over the past two months, which resulted in nine defeats in their previous 13 games, were on display again.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Savinho's first-half goal and an Erling Haaland header after the break made it 2-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  City's bid for a fifth straight title looks to be over as they are 14 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the result lifts them to fifth in the table and within striking distance of fourth-placed Chelsea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years," said City boss Pep Guardiola.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our mood is in a better position. It was tight in the second half, they were much better.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the new year can help us bounce back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest beat Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park, leapfrogging Chelsea and Arsenal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chris Wood chipped over Jordan Pickford for the opening goal in the 15th minute after being set up by Anthony Elanga.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wood turned provider for Forest's second, which came just after the hour mark when Morgan Gibbs-White produced some neat footwork before firing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-hit Spurs were on track to end a torrid December on a high after first-half goals by Rodrigo Bentancur and Brennan Johnson cancelled out Hwang Hee-chan's brilliant opener for Wolves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tottenham captain Son Heung-min also squandered a 43rd-minute penalty, but it did not appear to be too costly until substitute Jorgen Strand Larsen smashed home in the 87th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm the person in charge, so of course it hurts," said Postecoglou, whose team have won just one of their past seven Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When I see how hard they are trying, it hurts even more because you want them to get a reward and I think today they deserved a reward for their efforts."
  <br>
  <br>
  Crystal Palace won just their second home league game of the season, seeing off bottom club Southampton 2-1, thanks to goals from Trevoh Chalobah and Eberechi Eze.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dango Ouattara scored an 89th-minute leveller as Bournemouth drew 2-2 at Fulham.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea and Manchester United are in action on Monday, with Arsenal travelling to Brentford on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Marnus Labuschagne half-century and stubborn tail-end batting drove Australia to a 333-run lead at the end of day four in the fourth test in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving India facing a record chase to steal victory.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon and Scott Boland marched off to a big ovation from home fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having combined for an unbeaten 55-run partnership for the final wicket as Australia went to stumps at 228 for nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyon was 41 not out, with number 11 Boland on 10 and India's hopes of winning badly diminished in the final hour.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the five-test series level at 1-1, India's pace dynamo Jasprit Bumrah threatened to turn the match with a three-wicket burst before tea in front of 43,867 fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  But number three Labuschagne (70) and his captain Pat Cummins (41) steadied Australia with a 57-run partnership before Boland and Lyon frustrated India further.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day ended sourly for the tourists when Bumrah had Lyon caught in the slips by a juggling KL Rahul in the final over -- with a no-ball.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only one team has chased more than 300 for victory in an MCG test; England mowed down 332 to beat Australia in 1928.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Boland and Lyon made the going look easy, Labuschagne said there was enough in the pitch for Australia's bowlers on day five.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The movement (off the seam) has probably been the same but just the amount of bounce is significantly lower," Labuschagne told reporters of the changing wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So that makes for pretty tricky batting because more balls are hitting the stumps from a shorter length."
  <br>
  <br>
  As impressive as Australia's rearguard resistance was, it followed some shoddy middle order batting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having been in command at 80 for two, Australia crumbled in a Bumrah-led onslaught to slump to 91 for six.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohammed Siraj triggered the collapse when Steve Smith chased a wide, full delivery and nicked behind to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to be out for 13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah had Travis Head caught at square leg for one to earn his 200th test wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  He struck again four balls later to remove number six Mitchell Marsh for a duck with a gloved catch to Pant before bowling Alex Carey through bat and pad for two.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia were wobbling but Cummins rode out the storm with typical defiance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having scored 49 in the first innings, he produced a vital 41 to stall India's momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Labuschagne was out lbw to Siraj, Cummins added another 25 runs with Mitchell Starc (five) and Lyon before falling to the spin of all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fielding mishaps also cost India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped two chances, with Labuschagne spared at 46 when he nicked Akash Deep to the gully and opener Usman Khawaja reprieved on two with a spill at leg gully.
  <br>
  <br>
  Khawaja went on to make 21 before Siraj bowled him in the morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nitish Kumar Reddy also missed a tough chance to remove Cummins for nine, misjudging the flight of the ball when chasing the Aussie skipper's slog over mid-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  India may still count themselves blessed to be in the game at all. They were on the ropes on day three until Reddy rescued them with a maiden century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The all-rounder finished with 114, his 189-ball vigil ended by spinner Lyon a few overs into the fourth morning.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you ask me, I think everyone is capable of playing on this pitch," the 21-year-old told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll come back strong in the batting order."
  <br>
  <br>
  The healthy day four crowd brought total match attendance to 299,329, a record for a Boxing Day test in Melbourne. (Reuters)

<img alt="Jaylen Brown soars towards the basket in the second quarter. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785301_1_20241228165720.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jaylen Brown delivered a 44-point gem as the NBA champion Boston Celtics snapped a two-game losing streak with a 142-105 blowout of the Indiana Pacers on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brown set the tone with 15 points in the first quarter, when the Celtics out-scored the Pacers 39-22 to take control.
  <br>
  <br>
  He finished with six of the Celtics' 23 three-pointers and came up with four steals, posting his highest scoring output since he scored 50 in a win over Orlando in January 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He was big-time," Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said of Brown, who energised the TD Garden crowd with an array of thunderous dunks. "He has the ability to impact a team and an arena with his energy and his physicality.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When he gets into a certain zone he just gets locked in, and you kind of saw that on both ends of the floor."
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum scored 22 points and pulled down 13 rebounds and Payton Pritchard added 18 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists off the bench for the Celtics, who shrugged off the absence of Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday to post their biggest points total of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Haliburton scored 19 points and Bennedict Mathurin scored 18 for the Pacers, who were without injured Obi Toppin and Andrew Nembhard.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lopsided win over the team they vanquished in last season's Eastern Conference finals saw the Celtics avoid their first three-game skid of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also kept them in touch with Eastern Conference leaders Cleveland, who improved their league-best record to 27-4 with a 149-135 victory over the Denver Nuggets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points to lead six Cavaliers players in double figures as Cleveland won their sixth straight – and their 10th in 11 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavs drilled 23 three-pointers and led by as many as 21, withstanding a triple-double of 27 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists from Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came down to the wire in Houston, where Minnesota's Anthony Edwards drilled a step-back three-pointer with 23.2 seconds remaining to lift the Timberwolves to a 113-112 victory over the Rockets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fred VanVleet had a chance to win it for Houston, but missed a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 27 points and Edwards finished with 24 for the Timberwolves, who trailed by 16 points, 106-90, with 4:57 left to play.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Made it happen!" Edwards said. "Got some stops, we made some big shots – made a big shot at the end right there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Alperen Sengun led the Rockets with 38 points and 12 rebounds. Amen Thompson added 20 points as all five Houston starters scored in double figures only to come up short at the end.
  <br>
  <br>
  The New York Knicks pushed their winning streak to six games with a convincing 108-85 victory over the Magic in Orlando.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Brunson scored 26 points and handed out nine assists and Josh Hart added 23 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks, who made just four of their 15 three-point attempts but converted 24 of their 34 free-throw attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Magic, with top contributors Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Moritz Wagner on the injured list, were led by 27 points from Jalen Suggs.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama delivered 19 points and seven rebounds as the Spurs heated up in the second half to beat the Nets 96-87 in Brooklyn.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spurs connected on just 11 of their 40 shot attempts in the first half and were tied 41-41 at half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  They broke it open in the third quarter, connecting on 13 of their 18 shots. Wembanyama made four of his five attempts in the period, including three three-pointers, as the Spurs seized a 74-62 lead going into the fourth quarter. (AFP)

    Reddy's defiant maiden ton claws India back into Test

<img alt="Nitish Kumar Reddy celebrates after passing 100 on day three of the fourth Test against Australia. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785295_1_20241228154625.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nitish Kumar Reddy scored a defiant maiden century on Saturday as India fought back to reach 358-9 on a rain-hit third day of the fourth Test against Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rising all-rounder Reddy was applauded off the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 105 not out after rain ended play for the day midway through the final session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having provided much-needed stability to another shaky Indian batting effort, the 21-year-old will resume on Sunday alongside Mohammed Siraj, on two, with the first-innings deficit reduced to 116 runs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's push for a much bigger advantage after scoring 474 was stymied by Reddy and spin-bowling all-rounder Washington Sundar, who scored 50 as the pair put on 127 for the eighth wicket.
  <br>
  <br>
  To the roar of a large contingent of Indian supporters among a record 83,073 third-day crowd at the MCG, Reddy lofted Scott Boland over mid-on to reach three figures just before play was halted.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was an innings memorable for resolute defence, mixed with classical strokeplay.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reddy faced 176 balls, hitting 10 fours and one six, continuing the fine batting form that has marked his debut series.
  <br>
  <br>
  In his first six Test innings, he has scored 284 runs at an average of 71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seamers Boland, who took 3-57, and Pat Cummins with 3-86 were the most productive Australian bowlers in conditions that offered little assistance despite overcast skies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recalled Sundar's dogged knock off 162 balls ended when he was caught at first slip by Steve Smith from off-spinner Nathan Lyon.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended a partnership that traversed the entire second session after India had advanced from 164-5 overnight to 244-7 at lunch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sundar survived the most freakish moment of the day when on 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Attempting to flick a leg-sided delivery from Mitchell Starc, the ball flew from the back of the bat into the slip cordon where a diving Smith spilled a one-handed opportunity.
  <br>
  <br>
  India lost Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja in the opening session.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pant's innings of 28 ended when he over-balanced while attempting a ramp shot for six off Boland, top-edging the ball to third man where Lyon held the catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jadeja was trapped lbw when on 17, playing back to a Lyon delivery that skidded on.
  <br>
  <br>
  The crowd of 83,073 was a record for the third day of a Boxing Day Test, according to Cricket Australia, and the largest day three crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1937.
  <br>
  <br>
  The record total attendance for a Boxing Day Test is 271,865, which looks certain to be smashed on Sunday after 255,462 spectators came through the gates on the first three days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rain threatened throughout the day and about 40 minutes of play was lost in a period either side of tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The series is locked at 1-1 with the fifth and final Test to be played in Sydney next week. (AFP)

    Arsenal edge Ipswich to go second in Premier League

<img alt="Kai Havertz got the only goal but should have had two as Arsenal moved up to second. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785293_1_20241228143656.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Arsenal began life without Bukayo Saka by beating Ipswich 1-0 to move into second place in the English Premier League and cut Liverpool's lead to six points on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kai Havertz scored the only goal as Arsenal failed to turn their dominance into a more convincing scoreline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lack of a clinical goalscorer may ultimately cost Mikel Arteta's men a first league title in more than 20 years, but they took advantage of Chelsea's shock 2-1 defeat against Fulham on Thursday to become Liverpool's closest challenger.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka is set to be sidelined for "many weeks" in the words of Gunners' boss Arteta with fears the England international could be out until March due to a hamstring injury suffered in last weekend's 5-1 victory at Crystal Palace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta's solution was to start with Gabriel Martinelli in Saka's normal role wide right with Gabriel Jesus continuing up front after scoring five times in Arsenal's previous two outings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home side were dominant in possession but had few clear-cut chances to show for it until the final quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal were frustrated by Everton in a 0-0 draw in their last league game at the Emirates so there was relief when Havertz broke the deadlock on 23 minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The German prodded high into the net from Leandro Trossard's low cross for his 12th goal of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jesus did find the net once more with a cheeky finish between the legs of Arijanet Muric from an almost impossible angle, but was flagged offside.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal's prowess from set-pieces has been well-documented and they should have added to their goals from corners this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Magalhaes headed against the outside of the post from point-blank range when it seemed easier to score.
  <br>
  <br>
  As Ipswich's ambition grew as the second half wore on, so the chances at the other end began to flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Odegaard had given the home crowd a scare by going down holding the left ankle that saw him sidelined by injury for two months earlier in the campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Arsenal captain, though, was quickly back on his feet and weaving his way through the Ipswich defence with a mazy run and powerful strike that Muric tipped over.
  <br>
  <br>
  From the resulting corner, Declan Rice's powerful shot was blocked by Dara O'Shea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Havertz then wasted a glorious chance for his second and Muric saved once more from Mikel Merino to ensure a nervy ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Arsenal held out to leapfrog Nottingham Forest and Chelsea into second.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich remain second from bottom, three points adrift of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brighton missed the chance to move within one point of the top five as their poor run continued in a 0-0 draw at home to Brentford.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Seagulls are now winless in their past six games but they remain two points above their opponents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brentford had the ball in the net early on through Yoane Wissa but the goal was ruled out for offside after a VAR check.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just Brentford's second point away from home all season is enough to edge the Bees ahead of Tottenham into 11th. (AFP)

    Gao, Zhang inspire China to opening win at United Cup

<img alt="Gao Xinyu (Left) of China shakes hand with Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil after their women's singles match at the 2025 United Cup tennis tournament in Perth, Australia. Photo: Xinhua" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785270_1_20241228094532.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gao Xinyu came back from one set down and Zhang Zhizhen was almost flawless as China began the mixed team United Cup with a 3-0 victory over Brazil in Perth on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  China had a 2-0 lead ahead of the mixed doubles after Gao and Zhang prevailed in contrasting singles matches at RAC Arena.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fifth-seeded China's chances of a deep run in the tournament appeared to take a major hit when women's world No. 5 Zheng Qinwen pulled out, prioritising rest ahead of the Australian Open.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the 175th-ranked Gao filled her shoes brilliantly after bravely overcoming cramp to edge Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 in a three-hour, 22-minute thriller that was the longest women's singles match in the tournament's history.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao required a medical timeout in the second set and had her left thigh heavily strapped before the 17th-ranked Haddad Maia also succumbed to cramp during a gripping third set and resorted to several underhand serves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haddad Maia moved better after that, but Gao was not to be denied and clinched the biggest victory of her career in her first match against a top 50-ranked player.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have no idea what happened, my brain was empty and my whole body was cramping," Gao said. "It's a really big stage and it was a high quality match. I just pushed myself."
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far easier for the 45th-ranked Zhang, who thrashed Thiago Monteiro 6-3, 6-0 in a 54-minute demolition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang dictated rallies from the back of the court and completely overwhelmed his 109th-ranked opponent to ensure China sealed the Group E tie. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sacramento Kings have fired their head coach Mike Brown, ESPN reported on Friday, citing sources.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kings lost each of a recent five-game home-stand and sit 12th in the Western Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  ESPN said sources had told them that assistant coach Doug Christie is expected to take over on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sacramento is 13-18 this season, three games behind the last playoff position, and lost 114-113 to the Detroit Pistons on Thursday, blowing a 19-point third quarter lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Brown was voted the NBA's Coach of the Year in 2023 after ending the Kings' 16-year absence from the playoffs. He was handed a three-year contract extension in June.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's fiery pace attack destroyed India's top order on Friday to put them in the driving seat of the fourth Test after they set a daunting first innings target on the back of Steve Smith's 34th Test century.
 <br>
  <br>
  The visitors were 164-5 at the close on day two at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, still 310 runs adrift after Australia were out for 474 soon after lunch on the back of Smith's stylish 140.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rishabh Pant was not out six and Ravindra Jadeja on four, with three wickets in the final half-hour bursting India's momentum after they were 153-2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scott Boland and Pat Cummins grabbed two wickets each.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skipper Rohit Sharma reverted to his usual role as opener after dropping to six in the past two Tests.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it did nothing to help his woeful recent form and he was out for three, spooning an attempted pull shot off Pat Cummins to Boland at mid-on for a simple catch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cummins pounced again to remove the in-form KL Rahul with the last ball before tea, bowling him for 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  But opener Yashasvi Jaiswal stood firm with a high-quality innings, playing well off the front foot and crunching a series of stylish boundaries in his 82.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old, who scored 161 in the first Test at Perth, looked destined for another century but threw his wicket away in a comical mix up with Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaiswal set off for a quick single off Boland but his teammate said no, leaving the youngster stranded, ending a dangerous 102-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kohli, who was fined 20 percent of his match fee for a day one shoulder charge on Australian debutant Sam Konstas, was caught behind by Alex Carey for 36 off Boland, who then removed nightwatchman Akash Deep without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hosts resumed on 311-6 after a dominant opening day and plundered another 163 runs, with the composed Smith slamming 13 fours and three sixes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith padded up again on 68, with Cummins alongside him on eight.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took 15 off one Deep over before Smith hooked Jasprit Bumrah for six to rub salt in the wounds, with India's body language showing their frustration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith reached his 34th Test century with a boundary off Nitish Kumar Reddy, which came on the back of a return to form in the last Test in Brisbane where he made 101.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a patient innings from the 35-year-old and moved him alongside four other players on the all-time list of century-makers, including Sunil Gavaskar and Brian Lara.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only six men have scored more, led by Sachin Tendulkar's 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the landmark out of the way, both men began swinging the bat and Cummins paid the price, caught for a fine 49 by Reddy in the deep off Jadeja to end a 112-run stand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starc was bowled by Jadeja for 15 in the first over after lunch, with Smith following in bizarre fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Facing Deep, he danced down the wicket looking to drive but got an inside edge, with the ball bouncing off his pads and trickling onto leg stump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nathan Lyon (13) was the final wicket to fall, lbw to Bumrah who ended with 4-99.
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep on Friday pulled out of Australian Open qualifying and a warm-up tournament in Auckland, citing pain in her knee and shoulder.
 <br>
  <br>
  The former world number one, who is working to re-establish herself after a doping ban, was handed a wildcard for qualifying at the first major of the year next month at Melbourne Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  She was also due to play the lead-up Auckland Classic, but the 33-year-old Romanian said on Instagram her 2025 season was on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After discussing with my team at length, we agreed it is sensible to delay the start of my season," said Halep, the 2018 Melbourne runner-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will rest up and intend for my next event to be Cluj, where I can't wait to play in front of the amazing Romanian fans," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halep was suspended for doping in October 2022 and returned to the sport in March after having her ban reduced from four years to nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  She has denied knowingly doping. (AFP)

    Liverpool survive Leicester, Chelsea stunned by Fulham

<img alt="Liverpool's comeback lifted them seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785112_1_20241227062339.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Curtis Jones fired Liverpool seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as the title favourites survived a scare in their 3-1 win against struggling Leicester.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arne Slot's side were shocked by Jordan Ayew's early strike at Anfield, but the leaders recovered their composure to equalise just before the interval through Cody Gakpo.
  <br>
  <br>
  England midfielder Jones marked his 100th top-flight appearance with the second goal soon after half-time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mohamed Salah's 19th goal this term wrapped up Liverpool's 11th win in their last 13 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We created enough, but because we went 1-0 down it was a game," Liverpool manager Slot said. "Then you saw how good we are and Leicester didn't want to come back into the game."
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's comeback lifted them seven points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who were beaten 2-1 by Fulham earlier in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds, who hold a game in hand on Chelsea, have been beaten just once in 17 league matches this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have won 22 of their 26 games in all competitions in a remarkable run since Slot arrived from Feyenoord in the close-season to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Klopp led Liverpool to their last Premier League title in 2020 and Slot has them perfectly positioned to emulate that feat in the second half of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also through to the League Cup semi-finals and top of the Champions League, Liverpool, who travel to West Ham for their last match of the year on Sunday, will go into 2025 in contention of an unprecedented quadruple.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Leicester are one point from safety after a third consecutive defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah nearly gave Liverpool the perfect start as his close-range effort smacked the post.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on a night when Anfield was surrounded by a murky mist, Liverpool's defence was lost in the fog in the sixth minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Fulham scored twice in the final 10 minutes to end Chelsea's 12-game unbeaten run in all competitions with a stunning 2-1 Premier League win at Stamford Bridge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Substitutes Harry Wilson and Rodrigo Muniz shocked the Blues to secure Fulham's first away win at their west London rivals since 1979.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defeat leaves second-placed Chelsea still four points adrift of leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand over their nearest challengers, starting with the visit of Leicester later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Victory lifts Fulham up to eighth, level on points with champions Manchester City, and within just one point of fifth-placed Newcastle to further their European ambitions for next season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a privilege to give our fans this happiness," said Fulham boss Marco Silva. "The second half reaction was top. It is not a coincidence that we are the team in the Premier League that has got the most goals from players off the bench."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has insisted in recent weeks that his young side are not yet cut out for a title challenge despite their fine form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Silva's men have now taken points from Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea this month and the Portuguese's changes turned the tide in the visitors' favour. (AFP)

    Man Utd crash at Wolves, Man City held by Everton

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bruno Fernandes was sent off as Manchester United crashed to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat at lowly Wolves, while Erling Haaland missed a penalty as crisis-torn Manchester City failed to end their dismal run with a 1-1 draw against Everton.
 <br>
  <br>
  United suffered a third successive loss in all competitions to leave new boss Ruben Amorim with five defeats in his 10 games since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes was dismissed two minutes into the second half at Molineux for a second booking after fouling Nélson Semedo.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's 10 men cracked in the 58th minute, when Matheus Cunha's corner went straight in as goalkeeper André Onana flapped under pressure from Matt Doherty and Santiago Bueno.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hwang Hee-chan compounded Amorim's misery when he tapped in with just seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was another bitter blow for United, who endured a humiliating 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth at Old Trafford last weekend after losing 4-3 in the League Cup at Tottenham.
  <br>
  <br>
  With his team marooned in 14th place – just eight points above the relegation zone – Amorim's woes might not be over, with United facing in-form Newcastle on Monday before travelling to Liverpool in their first game of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's so tough to win games in this league with 11 men. With 10 men, it's more difficult," Amorim said. "Of course, when you lose, when we don't win, it's a step back – it was really hard with the sending off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves climbed out of the bottom three thanks to their second successive win under new manager Vitor Pereira.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, campions Manchester City have just one victory in their last 13 games in all competitions as their Christmas schedule started in disappointing fashion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bernardo Silva put City in front early on before Iliman Ndiaye salvaged a point for Everton.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven minutes into the second half, Haaland had the chance to end his longest goal drought at the Etihad but Jordan Pickford dived low to his right to make the save.
  <br>
  <br>
  City are languishing in seventh place and sit five points adrift of the top four, with their astonishing decline showing no sign of ending.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course we need results and we didn't get it. The team played really good again in all departments and unfortunately could not win," said City boss Pep Guardiola, whose side are at risk of failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 15 years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We accept it," Guardiola added. "It is life. We did not expect it to not win games many times – but what do you have to do? Continue." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two sailors have died in separate incidents in the treacherous Sydney to Hobart bluewater classic, organisers said Friday, while race favourite Comanche was forced to retire.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both crew members, on Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline, were hit by booms as the yachts were making their way south along the New South Wales coast after setting off from Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other crew tried to revive them, but were unsuccessful.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage," the race committee said in a brief statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gale-force winds and high seas had been forecast for the 628-nautical mile event, which ends in the Tasmanian state capital Hobart after the fleet tackles the notorious Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weather is a critical factor in the race, first held in 1945, with winds and conditions often changing rapidly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Six men died, five boats sank and 55 sailors were rescued in 1998, when a deep depression exploded over the fleet in the Bass Strait.
  <br>
  <br>
  So far seven yachts have pulled out from the initial fleet of 104, organisers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was one of the first casualties, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a major setback, race record holder Comanche is also out with mainsail damage, leaving the door open for its main supermaxi rival LawConnect to win line honours for the second straight year. (AFP)

    Australia's top order fires to take charge of 4th Test

<img alt="19-year-old Sam Konstas brings the crowd at the MCC alive with a ramp shot. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785087_1_20241226212400.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's top four all slammed 50 or better on Thursday to take a firm grip on day one of the fourth Test against India, with fearless teenage opener Sam Konstas stealing the show.
 <br>
  <br>
  Batting after captain Pat Cummins won the toss on a steamy day, the hosts reached 311-6 by the close in front of more than 87,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were aided by some inconsistent early bowling and a flying start from Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 19-year-old blasted a hugely entertaining 60 off 65 balls in a debut to remember, pounding 18 off one Jasprit Bumrah over and having a run-in with superstar Virat Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the close, Steve Smith was not out 68 and Pat Cummins was eight. Marnus Labuschagne made 72 and Usman Khawaja 57.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the bowlers were punished but they rallied with four wickets in the final session, including dangerman Travis Head for a duck, to haul themselves back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah led the charge, ending with 3-75.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was quite surreal with the big crowd, the biggest crowd I've ever played before," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I just played with freedom and backed myself. Lucky to get a few runs. A bit disappointed with the way I got out but hopefully we have got a bit of momentum for tomorrow."
  <br>
  <br>
  The five-match series is locked at 1-1 after India won by 295 runs in Perth before being crushed by 10 wickets in Adelaide. The rain-affected third Test in Brisbane was drawn.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of credit to the way Sam played. The intent he showed sort of put us on the back foot," said Indian batting coach Abhishek Nayar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But it took a lot of character for our bowlers to stick in there. It wasn't the easiest conditions to bowl. At times like that it is important to stick to your plans and post-lunch we came back really strong."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Konstas in for the axed Nathan McSweeney, he and Khawaja shared an 89-run opening partnership – the hosts' best of the series – before the teenager was undone by the spin of Ravindra Jadeja.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's youngest-ever opener faced the first over from a menacing Bumrah and survived despite the Indian spearhead repeatedly beating his bat.
  <br>
  <br>
  Konstas said before the match he had a plan to combat Bumrah, and as he got his eye in he incredibly reverse ramped him for two fours and a six in one over, bringing the crowd alive.
  <br>
  <br>
  A frustrated Kohli forcefully bumped shoulders with him at one point and they exchanged words, which could see both players in trouble if the match referee takes the matter further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was just doing my gloves and I think he accidentally bumped me. But that's just cricket, the tension," said Konstas.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was unfazed and slammed 18 off the next Bumrah over, including another six.
  <br>
  <br>
  His half-century came off just 52 balls – the third-fastest on debut for Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the other end Khawaja, twice the age of his opening partner, was content to be the support act, grinding his way to a 27th Test 50 in a welcome return to form.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah finally removed him after a 121-ball stay with Khawaja's pull shot going only as far as KL Rahul at midwicket, leaving Labuschagne and Smith to see them to tea.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith survived three lbw appeals from Akash Deep when they returned before India finally earned a reward when spinner Washington Sundar, in the side for Shubman Gill, tempted Labuschagne into a drive that was collected by Kohli.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dangerous Head marched to the crease after plundering centuries in both Adelaide and Brisbane but only lasted seven balls.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bumrah did the damage, with the Australian leaving a delivery that clattered into his off stump, before the Indian star accounted for Mitchell Marsh (4) and Alex Carey (31) fell to Deep.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smith kept plugging away to reach a 42nd Test 50 as he targets a second century of the series. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The crews of more than 100 yachts set sail on Thursday on a "boat-breaking" Sydney-Hobart yacht race, with gale-force winds and high seas forecast for the gruelling bluewater classic.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under blue, mid-summer skies, spectators crowded onto boats and lined the shore of a breezy Sydney Harbour as a starting cannon set the fleet on a dash to the open ocean.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a dramatic opening contest, reigning line honours champion LawConnect lost an early lead when one of her sails failed to unfurl.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comanche, four-time line honours champion and the event's record holder, took over as frontrunner.
  <br>
  <br>
  By late evening, Comanche was speeding southwards down Australia's east coast with a lead of more than eight nautical miles over LawConnect.
  <br>
  <br>
  LawConnect edged Comanche to win by just 51 seconds last year and the two 100-foot supermaxis are again expected to battle for line honours.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alive, last year's overall winner of the Tattersall Cup, which takes into account boat size and other factors, was the first casualty of this year's race, retiring with reported engine issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 104 entrants at the start of the race, 102 remain after the withdrawals of Alive and the two-handed Transcendence Rudy Project, which dismasted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Race crews face gales, storms and big waves as they sail south and then tackle the notorious Bass Strait towards the Tasmanian state capital Hobart.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weather is a critical factor in the 628-nautical mile event, first held in 1945. (AFP)

<img alt="Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James hug it out after serving up a festive feast for the fans. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785051_1_20241226153332.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 LeBron James and Steph Curry served up a Christmas Day feast as their rivalry delivered another classic with the Los Angeles Lakers edging the Golden State Warriors 115-113 on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Curry made a stunning 31-foot three-point throw with 7.1 seconds left on the clock to tie the game, only for Austin Reaves to win the game for the Lakers with a driving layup with 1.1 seconds left.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 36-year-old Curry and James, three years his senior, had traded three-pointers down the stretch as fans were treated to a ding-dong finale from the two future Hall of Famers.
  <br>
  <br>
  James put up 31 points and ten assists without the support of teammate Anthony Davis, who left the game in the first quarter after turning his ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Game-winner Reaves enjoyed a triple-double with 26 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Curry's 38 points included 8-15 three-point shooting while Anthony Wiggins made 21 points and 12 rebounds, but Golden State fell to an 11th loss in 14 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is the day of giving, and that's what me and Steph continue to do and try to do for our fans, for our beautiful game," said James.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't know how many times we're going to be able to have this matchup. We try to give the game what it deserves, because it's given us so much, we try to give it right back," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  James was playing in a record 19th Christmas Day game and took the occasion to take a gentle swipe at the NFL's encroachment on the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love the NFL but Christmas is our day," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mikal Bridges and the New York Knicks edged Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs 117-114 in a thriller at Madison Square Garden.
  <br>
  <br>
  French star Wembanyama put up 42 points with 18 rebounds and four blocks for the Spurs but Bridges took the glory with a brilliant 15-point fourth-quarter display that left him with a season-high 41 points and the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 20-year-old, who stands 7-foot-3 (2.21m), was 16-31 on shooting and made six of 16 three-point throws and while Bridges took the applause from the home crowd, he was quick to praise the Frenchman.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From 40 feet out, from right under the rim, from 15 feet out, he's just unbelievable, just to see what he's doing, credit to him and how much work he has put in," said Bridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 28-year-old Bridges, who was traded from the Brooklyn Nets in July, shot 17-25 from the field and was six for nine on three-point attempts as his team improved to 20-10.
  <br>
  <br>
  San Antonio were just a point behind with two minutes remaining before Bridges made back-to-back jumpers to open up a five-point lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Karl-Anthony Towns with 21 points and Jalen Brunson with 20 points and nine assists were crucial for the Knicks in the win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions the Boston Celtics (22-8) lost back-to-back games for the first time this season when they were upset at home by the Philadelphia 76ers 118-114.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-prone 76ers star Joel Embiid hurt his ankle in a pre-game fall but was able to start and showed his importance with 27 points, nine rebounds and the game-clinching free throws at the end to clinch the win for the 11-17 Philadelphia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyres Maxey scored 33 points and made 12 assists with his 13 points in the fourth quarter crucial as Philadelphia, who had led by 16 at the break, recovered from Boston's third quarter rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jayson Tatum top-scored for the Celtics with 32 points and also grabbed 15 rebounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was far from a Merry Christmas for the Dallas Mavericks who lost their Slovenian star Luka Doncic with a calf injury in the second quarter of their 105-99 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves in a rematch of last season's Western Conference finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Doncic, who had scored 14 points, limped out of the game and did not return. The Mavericks did manage a brave comeback attempt without him, before falling short.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards put up 26 points for Minnesota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Timberwolves led 57-40 at the half and extended that advantage to 28-points before Dallas, led by Kyrie Irving who made 39 points, started to work their way back into the contest.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was close at the end but Irving missed a three-point shot that would have given Dallas the lead in the last minute and a two-foot shot from Edwards and a pair of free throws from Julius Randle made sure of the win. (AFP)

    O'Sullivan to move to HK, hails city's snooker scene

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan, who recently obtained residency in Hong Kong, said he will try to ramp up his form ahead of a major tournament scheduled in Kai Tak in March next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The seven-time world champion became an SAR resident in October through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme. Fellow snooker star Judd Trump followed suit earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Sullivan explained what drove the decision during an exclusive interview with RTHK in Macau, where he's headlining an invitational tournament.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I always enjoyed playing in Hong Kong, with a fantastic venue and good promoters," O'Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Rocket", as he's often referred to, is also looking forward to the World Grand Prix at the Kai Tak Sports Park, the first snooker ranking event in the city in more than three decades.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to play some more tournaments to be ready, I think. My aim is to play more tournaments in the new year … I need to maybe make a bit more of an effort," he admitted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 49-year-old Englishman said he'll consider "year by year" whether to wrap up his professional career.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he already revealed plans to set up a number of snooker clubs around the world, including in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everybody loves snooker, and everyone loves to watch snooker. Snooker is the hardest out of all the cue sports. It's very popular here in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [Hong Kong] needs a good academy, good training centre for young players to come and learn and get good coaching, and help them develop their own game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also confirmed plans to relocate to the city, and is now looking for an apartment with a view of Victoria Harbour.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about Trump's decision to follow in his footsteps, O'Sullivan said it was "not out of surprise".
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it makes sense since [Trump's] girlfriend is from Hong Kong. He likes being here more than the UK, it makes complete sense for him," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked whether he will be open to collaboration, O'Sullivan gave a more reserved answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't really align myself with other players. I like to be my own boss, do my own thing. I think it's better if we both do our own career, our own stuff away from snooker," O'Sullivan replied.

    Judd Trump 'much happier' playing as HK resident

<div class="itemFullText">
 Snooker star Judd Trump said he is looking forward to playing in a major tournament at Kai Tak next March as a Hong Kong resident.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the first time in 35 years, the SAR will stage a ranking event as the World Snooker Tour announced earlier that the World Grand Prix will take place at the brand new Kai Tak Sports Park between March 4 and 9, 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who just obtained a Hong Kong passport through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, was speaking to reporters on Wednesday ahead of a match in Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to inspire the younger generation in the city to take up snooker along with local stars Marco Fu and Ng On-yee.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I hope to really inspire the next generation because there are already so many younger players coming through in Hong Kong,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Marco Fu is doing such a good job to inspire, and in the women’s game, [we have] On-yee, I really hope that I can promote snooker to everyone in Hong Kong and make it as cool as possible, and get younger kids away from different sports and enjoy snooker,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he is open to promoting the sport in the city along with Ronnie O’Sullivan, who also became a Hong Kong resident two months ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  The snooker star also shared that he loved the vibrant life Hong Kong has to offer.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong has a fast-paced lifestyle, everyone is always on the move, and there is also so much to do, as you are so close to everyone and if you drive 15 minutes, you’re already at the beaches, somewhere more relaxing,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it’s perfect for what I do, as sometimes I like to feel the hustle and bustle around everybody, and sometimes I want to get away and do more relaxing stuff,” he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he lives in the city for at least six months of the year, and that his girlfriend was a major reason why he decided to move to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  “At the moment, I only spend time in the UK for tournaments and my priority is to be as happy as possible off the table. I’m much happier living in Hong Kong,” he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Novak Djokovic is confident he can still win Grand Slams, starting at the Australian Open, with the Serbian kickstarting his bid for an unprecedented 11th title and record 25th major crown in Brisbane this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka, who is gunning for a third Melbourne Park trophy, joins him at the Queensland Tennis Centre from December 29-January 5 in a stellar women's field.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 season gets under way on Friday with the mixed-teams United Cup in Perth and Sydney, headlined by world number two Iga Swiatek in her first tournament since revelations that she served a one-month doping suspension.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first season since 37-year-old Djokovic began playing that none of the other so-called "Big Four" will be on the other side of the net following the retirements this year of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they faded, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz stepped up to become the new Grand Slam kings, with both men opting against a warm-up tournament leading into the first major of the year which begins on January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  As doubts grew over Djokovic's motivation and ability to take down the new guard after a disappointing 2024, he stunned the tennis world by hiring Murray to coach him.
  <br>
  <br>
  A resurgent Grigor Dimitrov, Holger Rune, and Frances Tiafoe are also playing in Brisbane, as is Australian Nick Kyrgios, who returns after injuries restricted him to just one ATP Tour singles match in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Challenging Sabalenka on Pat Rafter Arena will be America's top talents Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro, ranked seven and eight respectively, along with former world number two Ons Jabeur and veteran Victoria Azarenka.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sabalenka, who beat China's high-flying Zheng Qinwen in the Melbourne final this year, had a sensational 2024 which culminated in being named WTA Player of Year this month. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 World snooker number one Judd Trump has become a Hong Kong resident through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
  His move comes two months after another British superstar from the sport, Ronnie O'Sullivan, did the same.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a video released by Hong Kong Talent Engage, the government's office to attract talent, Trump, 35, said he was looking forward to making new friends in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I love just being around the hustle and bustle of people. For me I really enjoy the energy in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I love to be around people and I love to see people thrive and go about their business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The office quoted Trump as saying he loves everything about the SAR from the food, the people and the buildings, and these are what inspired him to be in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  A world snooker champion in 2019, Trump has won 30 major titles so far during his career.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local and British media earlier reported that Trump has been dating local show host and former figure skater Maisy Ma and that they spend time in both Hong Kong and Dubai.

 Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has capped off a historic 2024 by winning The Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the third time, tying him with basketball great Michael Jordan. He trails only four-time winners Lance Armstrong, Tiger Woods and LeBron James.
 <br>
  <br>
  “I’m very honoured,” Ohtani said through translator Matt Hidaka. ”Obviously all the hard work has paid off. Maybe next year, I’ll get the award again.”
  <br>
  <br>
  In balloting by 74 sports journalists from the AP and its members, Ohtani received 48 votes. He previously won the award in 2023 and 2021, when he was with the Los Angeles Angels.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Growing up in Japan, I did follow Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods,” he said. “I would see their accolades and how they were successful in the United States.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP honour has been given out since 1931. Golfer Babe Didrikson won six times, the most by a man or woman.
  <br>
  <br>
  Swimmer Léon Marchand of France, who won four gold medals at the Paris Olympics, was second with 10 votes in balloting announced Monday. Golfer Scottie Scheffler, whose victories this year included the Masters and an Olympic gold medal, was third with nine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The AP Female Athlete of the Year will be announced on Wednesday. (AP)

    Arsenal's Saka sidelined 'weeks' with hamstring injury

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bukayo Saka will be sidelined for "many weeks" after suffering a hamstring injury in Arsenal's 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, with manager Mikel Arteta describing his loss as a "huge" blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  The England winger went down midway through the first half at Selhurst Park on Saturday and had to be replaced by Leandro Trossard.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is not looking good. He will be out for many weeks," Arteta said at a press conference, adding he could not be more specific.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spaniard said the loss of the 23-year-old, who has nine goals and 13 assists in all competitions this season, would force him into a rethink.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously he's a big player for us," he said. "You just have to see the impact that he has on the team, but it's going to be a really good exercise for all of us to think about ways to overcome another challenge – because we've already had a lot in the season."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said Saka was "gutted" and "really emotional" after discovering the extent of his injury.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also revealed that fellow winger Raheem Sterling had injured his knee and would be out for a number of weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to look internally at what we have and be creative," said the Gunners boss, adding that he did not know if the club would sign a winger in the January transfer window.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saka was filmed leaving Selhurst Park on crutches, souring what had been a comprehensive second win over the Palace in four days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta, whose third-placed team face Premier League strugglers Ipswich on Saturday, said he was confident that Saka would be back well before the end of the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's part of the development of a player," Arteta said. "At some stage, at this level, you are going to get injured – unfortunately badly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could have been worse, it could have been something else that can take you out for a year," he added. "It's how you react to that, how you overcome that situation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arteta said he was "putting some ideas together" about how to cope in the winger's absence.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked if the congested fixture schedule had played a part in Saka's injury, Arteta said the issue was more to do with consistently high workloads over many seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, Bukayo and Declan (Rice), they played over 130 games in two seasons," he said. "So what's going to happen in the second one, the third one or the fourth one, if that continues the same way? It's unsustainable." (AFP)

    England captain Stokes out three months with injury

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 England Test captain Ben Stokes faces at least three months out after tearing his left hamstring during the tour of New Zealand, team management announced on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 33-year-old all-rounder had already been ruled out of next year's Champions Trophy one-day international tournament in Pakistan and the preceding white-ball tour of India.
  <br>
  <br>
  Further assessments have since revealed the full extent of the injury, with Stokes set to undergo surgery in January, said an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes suffered the injury while bowling during the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stokes did not bat in the second innings of that match as England slumped to a 423-run defeat – a result that meant his side still won a three-match series 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  He previously missed this year's home series against Sri Lanka and the first Test in Pakistan after tearing the hamstring on the same left leg in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  England's next Test is at home to Zimbabwe in May. They will then host a five-match Test series against India starting in June, before their pinnacle 2025 to 2026 Ashes tour of Australia. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Denver's NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokić shook off a slow start to post a 27-point triple-double as the Nuggets rallied to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 132-129 in overtime.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jokić, who claimed his third MVP in four years last season, added 13 rebounds and 10 assists.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Serb star, who was held to six points in the first half, bemoaned another slow start for Denver – who trailed by as many as 17 in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  They took a 111-109 lead on Julian Strawther's layup with just over four minutes left in regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  CJ McCollum put New Orleans back in front 119-117 with 53.2 seconds left in the fourth, but Denver guard Jamal Murray drilled a step-back basket with nine seconds to go to tie it at 119-119, and when McCollum missed a three-pointer they went to overtime.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jokić took over in the extra session, scoring Denver's first six points as they handed the Pelicans a seventh straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seems like we just like it that way," Jokić said of the late heroics needed by the Nuggets. "But we should be more hungry."
  <br>
  <br>
  Murray also scored 27 points for Denver, and Russell Westbrook added 21 off the bench. Jordan Hawkins led New Orleans' scoring with 25 points and McCollum had 24.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, the Indiana Pacers posted their fourth straight win in impressive style, powering away in the second half to beat the Kings 122-95 in Sacramento.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pascal Siakam delivered a double-double of 19 points and 10 rebounds and the Pacers put up 70 points in the second half of a dominant victory in which seven Indiana players scored in double figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Myles Turner scored 15 points, star guard Tyrese Haliburton and reserve Ben Sheppard added 14 apiece and T.J. McConnell contributed 12 points and 10 assists off the bench.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We brought it from start to finish," Sheppard said. "The energy we brought, both the bench and the starters – it was a great team win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Point guard De'Aaron Fox scored 23 points to lead the Kings, and Domantas Sabonis added 17 points and 21 rebounds – but Kings fans were booing as the team fell to a fourth straight defeat.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tough night for us," Kings coach Mike Brown said. "There are going to be nights when you don't have it offensively, but we can't give up 70 points in a half." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels threw five touchdown passes on Sunday as the Commanders halted Philadelphia's 10-game NFL winning streak with a 36-33 victory in which the Eagles also lost quarterback Jalen Hurts to a concussion.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commanders piled up 22 points in the fourth quarter, rookie signal-caller Daniels finding Jamison Crowder with a nine-yard touchdown pass with six seconds left to secure what had seemed an unlikely win.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The game's never over until the clock hits zero," Daniels said after a win that kept the Commanders' playoff hopes alive while eliminating Dallas and San Francisco from contention.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It feels awesome," Daniels added. "Everybody can enjoy their Christmas now."
  <br>
  <br>
  "You got those guys that came in on the win streak they were on, they were hot and they’re a very good team," he went on to say. "And rightfully so, good offense, good defence, all-around well-prepared team and you want to go out there and see where you match up against those type of guys."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Eagles, who hadn't lost since September, were without Hurts for most of the game after he hit his head on the turf after a tackle in the first quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kenny Pickett replaced him and threw for 143 yards with a touchdown and an interception, but at 12-3 the Eagles dropped out of a tie for best record in the NFC and failed to clinch the NFC East division title.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the Detroit Lions remained atop the NFC with a franchise-record 13th victory, cruising past the Bears 34-17 in Chicago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stung by a loss to Buffalo that snapped their 11-game winning streak, the Lions jumped to a 20-point lead on the way to setting a single-season franchise record for points scored with 493 so far.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lios quarterback Jared Goff threw for 336 yards and three touchdowns, including an 82-yard TD pass to Jameson Williams, who had a career-high 143 receiving yards on five catches.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, as the Lions used a trick play in which Goff pretended to stumble to spring tight end Sam LaPorta for a 21-yard touchdown pass on the opening drive of the second half. (AFP/AP)

    Mbappé strikes as Real Madrid down Sevilla

<img alt="Mbappé opened the scoring for Real Madrid, who recorded their twelfth straight victory in all competitions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784625_1_20241223074531.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé scored a screamer and set up another goal as Real Madrid thrashed Sevilla 4-2 on Sunday to move second in La Liga above stuttering rivals Barcelona.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Atlético Madrid beat Barca on Saturday to claim top spot at Christmas, Carlo Ancelotti's side also took advantage with a comfortable home win which leaves them a point behind the leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid coach Ancelotti said ahead of Sevilla's visit that Mbappé's adaptation period had ended following his summer switch from Paris Saint-Germain and the French forward proved the coach right with a strong performance and his 14th goal of the season across all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fede Valverde also netted a brilliant effort from range, with Rodrygo Goes and Brahim Diaz on the scoresheet for the hosts too.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isaac Romero and Dodi Lukebakio scored for Sevilla, although they were thoroughly outplayed on veteran defender Jesus Navas' final game for the club.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that we know each other better, my arrival changed a lot of things, and now, as the coach said, the adaptation is over and I feel very good in the team," Mbappé said. "We can see on the pitch that I click better with my team-mates and now we're all playing better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé, back after a brief absence with a thigh injury, scored for Madrid in midweek as they won the Intercontinental Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was welcome relief for the forward after missing two penalties in recent weeks against Liverpool and Athletic Bilbao, as well as suffering criticism for his form.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I know I've got much more in my legs than I'm showing, but in the last games I've played better," Mbappé added. "The Bilbao game was good for me, I hit the bottom, I missed a penalty and it was a moment to realise that I have to give everything for this shirt and show my personality."
  <br>
  <br>
  With Vinícius Júnior suspended, Mbappé took the reins and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute as Madrid brought the ball out from the back and worked it to Rodrygo on the left flank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Brazilian squared to Mbappé on the edge of the area, who took one touch to control, another to set himself and with his third, smashed a fierce effort past the helpless Álvaro Fernández.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid's second, 10 minutes later, was even better, with Valverde firing a screamer into the top corner from over 30 yards out after a short corner routine.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ancelotti's side were in full flow and the third followed in the 34th minute when Lucas Vázquez crossed for Rodrygo, who finished with aplomb. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Joao Fonseca became the second youngest champion of the NextGen ATP tournament on Sunday when he defied his lowly ranking of 145 to defeat Learner Tien in the final.
 <br>
  <br>
  Brazil's Fonseca, 18, came through 2-4, 4-3 (10/8), 4-0, 4-2 to see off his left-handed American opponent.
  <br>
  <br>
  He is the youngest champion at the event since current world number one Jannik Sinner claimed the title also at the age of 18 five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I was really nervous before the match. I knew it was going to be so difficult," Fonseca said before lifting the trophy with tennis legend Rafael Nadal watching on from the stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I played a final against Learner in juniors at the 2023 US Open and I know the way he can play," he added. "He is such a nice guy and a great player, so I knew it was going to be difficult, mentally and physically. But I got through."
  <br>
  <br>
  Fonseca, the lowest-ranked player in the eight-man field, won all five matches he played this week at the Red Sea venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  He began the year ranked at 730 in the world and having made a maiden ATP quarter-final in Rio this year, he will be aiming to make significant progress in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I need to believe when I go before a tournament that I can win," Fonseca said. "But now I have won it I am thinking, 'Wow, I made it'. I am very proud of myself." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool swept four points clear at the top of the Premier League as Mohamed Salah's masterclass inspired a memorable 6-3 rout of Tottenham, while Manchester United crashed to a humiliating 3-0 home defeat against Bournemouth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Salah delivered a sublime performance featuring two goals and a pair of assists as Arne Slot's side ran riot in north London.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 32-year-old is now Liverpool's fourth top scorer ever with 229 goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Salah's brace took him past Billy Liddell, with only Ian Rush (346), Roger Hunt (285) and Gordon Hodgson (241) ahead of him.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rampant Reds have won 21 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Slot and have a game in hand on Chelsea to strengthen their lead in the title race.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a remarkable display of Liverpool's firepower as Luis Díaz and Alexis Mac Allister scored to put them in command.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For 60 minutes we did everything we had to do, we were comfortable and good with the ball – the main thing is we worked very hard," Slot said. "But you have to be on top of your game for the whole game and we didn't do that."
  <br>
  <br>
  James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke scored for Tottenham, but an eighth league defeat this season leaves them languishing in 11th place as the pressure mounts on Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you want to discount the fact we're missing a goalkeeper, two centre-backs and a left-back and that hasn't coincided with how we're doing – I don't know what to say anymore," Postecoglou said of his critics.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim, who once again left Marcus Rashford out of his squad, is set for a miserable Christmas following the worst result of his brief reign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Languishing in 13th place, United have suffered four defeats in nine matches in all competitions since Amorim arrived from Sporting Lisbon in November to replace the sacked Erik ten Hag.
  <br>
  <br>
  United's second successive loss after their League Cup exit at Tottenham on Thursday underlined Amorim's belief that their road back to the top will be long and arduous.
  <br>
  <br>
  United, who have conceded first in their last six games, were booed off at half-time, while the final whistle was greeted by more jeers from the few fans who stayed until the bitter end.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous – I felt it in the stadium," Amorim said. "We have to suffer again, but we will try to win."
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim's decision to play without Rashford for the third consecutive game will face fresh scrutiny after United's wretched performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amorim surprisingly omitted the 27-year-old England forward from the squad for United's win at Manchester City last weekend, prompting Rashford to hint he was willing to leave the club for a "new challenge".
  <br>
  <br>
  Rashford was at Old Trafford wearing a United tracksuit amid his extended exile, as Amorim made six changes from the line-up beaten 4-3 by Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese world number five Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the season-opening United Cup on Sunday citing the need for more rest, but plans to be at the Australian Open.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old is coming off a breakthrough season that reaped three singles titles, with the highlight winning Olympic gold in Paris.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also made her first Grand Slam final, at Melbourne Park, losing in straight sets to current world number one Aryna Sabalenka on the back of playing the mixed-teams United Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng has opted for more rest this time ahead of the season-opening major from January 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the long season that 2024 was for me, I need a few extra weeks of rest, recovery, and good training to get ready for the new season," she wrote on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I had such a fantastic time at the United Cup in January of this year, and therefore will miss the event greatly.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still, I'm so excited to be back in Australia soon and I will see you all in Melbourne in a couple of weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  China begin their United Cup campaign against Brazil in Perth on Friday, leaving world No.175 Gao Xinyu as their top-ranked woman. (AFP)

    Usyk one of the world's greats after Fury win

<img alt="Oleksandr Usyk reacts after his fight against Tyson Fury. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784549_1_20241222081918.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Oleksandr Usyk won his heavyweight championship rematch against Tyson Fury by unanimous decision on Saturday to stay unbeaten across two divisions and underline his right to be counted as one of the all-time greats.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Ukrainian, who forced the pace and repeatedly tagged Fury with his accurate left hook, was awarded the fight 116-112 by all three judges, handing Fury his second straight loss.
  <br>
  <br>
  Usyk's win takes him to 23-0 with 14 knockouts and extends one of the all-time best careers that includes Olympic gold and undisputed champion at cruiserweight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's a great fighter, it's a great performance," Usyk, 37, said of Fury, who was unbeaten over 35 fights until he lost their four-belt unification bout in May. "Unbelievable 24 rounds for my career."
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the WBA, WBO and WBC belts were on the line this time after Usyk, focused on the lucrative rematch, relinquished his IBF title rather than face challenger Daniel Dubois.
  <br>
  <br>
  By beating Fury seven months ago, "The Cat" had already joined the likes of Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis and Mike Tyson as undisputed heavyweight, and the first of the four-belt era.
  <br>
  <br>
  The defeat opens up an uncertain future for the 36-year-old Fury, now 34-2-1, who announced his retirement in 2022 only to change his mind and return to the ring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury, wearing a Santa-style red-and-white robe and bushy beard, appeared to Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You", before a determined-looking Usyk strode out in Cossack gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 6ft 9ins (206cm) Briton's jab held Usyk at bay early on and he landed a jarring right in round two. Usyk caught Fury flush with a left as he raised the pace in round three.
  <br>
  <br>
  They went toe-to-toe in a punishing fifth round, with Fury pummelling body shots while Usyk launched a flurry to the head. In the sixth, he stung Fury with a clean shot to the nose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The supremely fit Usyk, renowned for taking charge in the closing rounds, was the aggressor in the seventh, tagging Fury with a hook as the "Gypsy King" backed away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fury regained the initiative in the ninth, wielding his jab and one-two combinations and leaning on the Ukrainian, utilising his career-heaviest 281lb (127.4kg) of weight.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was see-saw stuff as they traded blows but Usyk rocked Fury in the 11th with a lightning combination that ended with yet another left hook to the face.
  <br>
  <br>
  An Usyk uppercut to Fury's chin highlighted a furious final round and there was little doubt about the winner as the Ukrainian sank to his knees, arms aloft.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reports put the prize purse at US$190 million, with Usyk, as defending champion, expected to receive the bigger share -- a reversal of fortunes from May.
  <br>
  <br>
  The fight sits high in the portfolio of Saudi Arabia's oil-funded push into sports, which has drawn accusations of "sportswashing" its dubious human rights record.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Formula One, the LIV Golf tour, Newcastle United and a swathe of ageing football stars, the kingdom's strategy confirmed its crowning moment this month when it was awarded football's 2034 World Cup. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester City slumped to their ninth defeat in 12 matches at Aston Villa on Saturday as Arsenal dismantled Crystal Palace 5-1 to reignite their Premier League title charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest stormed Brentford's fortress to briefly climb to third in the table and Alexander Isak scored his first hat-trick in the English top flight as Newcastle ran riot at Ipswich.
  <br>
  <br>
  City boss Pep Guardiola -- in the worst spell of his managerial career -- made multiple changes following last week's painful derby defeat to Manchester United but it was to no avail as his injury-hit side lost 2-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran scored his seventh Premier League goal of the season to put Villa ahead in the 16th minute and Morgan Rogers doubled the advantage for the impressive home side in the 65th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Phil Foden scored his first top-flight goal of the season in stoppage time but it proved too little too late for the flailing champions, whose spark has vanished.
  <br>
  <br>
  City have now lost six Premier League games in the current campaign, twice as many as they suffered during the whole of last season, when they were crowned champions for the fourth time in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola said he trusted his players to turn things around despite their shocking run of just one win from their past 12 games in all competitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have to think positive and I have incredible trust in the guys," he told the BBC. "Some of them have incredible pride and desire to do it. We have to find a way, step by step, sooner or later to find a way back."
  <br>
  <br>
  A bullish Mikel Arteta said Arsenal, who have not won the Premier League title since 2004, are now firmly in the title picture after his team's thumping win at Selhurst Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Palace in the League Cup on Wednesday, scored two more against the same opponents and there were also goals for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and substitute Declan Rice.
  <br>
  <br>
  The third-placed Gunners are just three points behind Liverpool, who are in action at Tottenham on Sunday, but Arne Slot's men have played two games fewer. Chelsea are in second spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  At one stage earlier this month Liverpool had a yawning nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are not even halfway so we're going to try and set something. For us it's on," Arteta told Sky Sports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm going to enjoy Christmas with my family because when you win it's always better," added the Spaniard, whose side have finished as Premier League runners-up for the past two seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  Forest won their third consecutive Premier League match to keep up their push for European football, condemning Brentford to their first home defeat this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ola Aina slotted home the opener towards the end of the first half and Anthony Elanga made it 2-0 early in the second period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's about enjoying the moment," said Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo. "It's a very hard competition. Every game is so difficult and the next one is going to be very tough.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're very proud of all the things we've been able to achieve, but we've achieved nothing yet."
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle deepened Ipswich's plight and lifted themselves to seventh in the table with a 4-0 win at Portman Road.
  <br>
  <br>
  Isak volleyed Eddie Howe's team ahead in the first minute and Jacob Murphy doubled Newcastle's lead before Isak side-footed in from close range just before the break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Sweden international scored his third nine minutes into the second half, poking the ball home after more fine work from Murphy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a ninth defeat in 17 games for Ipswich since they returned to the Premier League and they remain in the relegation zone, two points from safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mats Wieffer gave Brighton a 51st-minute lead against West Ham at the London Stadium but Mohammed Kudus equalised seven minutes later and the match finished 1-1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Away from Saturday's action, Premier League basement club Southampton named former Roma and Torino boss Ivan Juric as their new manager, replacing the sacked Russell Martin. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 George Eastham, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad, has died at the age of 88, his former club Stoke City announced on their website on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Eastham, whose father also named George once played for England, won 19 caps for his country between 1963 and 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not play in England's 1966 campaign on home soil but the Blackpool-born winger was part of Alf Ramsey's squad that lifted the World Cup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham made 124 and 207 league appearances for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively before moving to Stoke in 1966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years earlier he had been involved in a court case against the so-called 'slavery contracts' which improved players' freedom to move between clubs and duly reformed the British transfer market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Stoke City Football Club family is immensely saddened by the passing of club legend George Eastham OBE at the age of 88," his former club said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eastham represented the club for eight seasons in the top division of the English game.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He is perhaps best remembered as the man whose goal secured the 1972 League Cup in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Wembley," said Stoke.
  <br>
  <br>
  After retiring, Eastham tried his hand at management, taking charge of Stoke for a short spell in the late 1970s.
  <br>
  <br>
  He later emigrated to South Africa where he was a football coach for local black children. (AFP)

Photo courtesy of World Football Legends" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784516_1_20241221191605.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of an exhibition football match between former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars have issued an apology, after arrangements for a meet-and-greet session with veteran players reportedly left some fans disappointed.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, Real Madrid fans complained they paid HK$6,880 to meet the La Liga legends but were unable to get their autographs and take photos with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to organisers, fans could purchase an "experience set" that included a ticket to the star-studded match at Hong Kong Stadium, an autograph session with either one of the teams in the morning, and other merchandise items.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Real Madrid Hong Kong Fans Club said "an unpleasant incident" happened at the meeting and had notified the police.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club also accused the organisers of not following through with their remedial measures such as arranging for a group photo to be taken before the match, and that fans were unable to hand their own memorabilia directly to the players for a signature.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an apology on Saturday, organisers said they're keeping in close contact with the fans club and those affected to "properly handle relevant matters."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Regarding the issue that arose in [Friday's] signing event, we have done our best to deal with it immediately and are proactively working out solutions with affected fans and related parties," they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are aware that this incident has aroused public attention, and we deeply apologise for the inconvenience and confusion caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Organisers also vowed to make better arrangements to avoid similar situations from happening again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Cleveland Cavaliers delivered a reality check to newly crowned NBA Cup champions Milwaukee on Friday, dominating the Bucks 124-101 to push their league-best record to 24-4.
 <br>
  <br>
  Donovan Mitchell scored 27 points and Darius Garland added 16 for the Cavs, who led by as many as 36 points as the Bucks struggled in the absence of injured guard Damian Lillard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Giannis Antetokounmpo, who led the Bucks to victory in the NBA Cup final against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, scored 33 points with 14 rebounds and three steals.
  <br>

  Khris Middleton, back from illness, scored 14 points off the bench for Milwaukee, but starting guards Andre Jackson Jr and AJ Green were a combined 0-for-9 from the field, neither contributing a point.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Cavaliers, winners of seven of their last eight, improved to 15-1 at home and got good news with the season debut of Max Strus – who had been sidelined with hip and ankle injuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Strus scored nine points in 19:07 minutes off the bench for Cleveland and drilled three of their 20 three-pointers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We did it on both ends of the floor," Mitchell said. "We set the tone, offensively, defensively. Knowing they had a long trip back (we were) trying to get going early, push the pace, and we did it for 48 minutes."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who had called it "weird" to pick up regular-season action after playing the semi-finals and final of the in-season tournament in Las Vegas, said the game was not a good gauge of where the Bucks are.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We were flat, tired, whatever you want to call it," Rivers said. "There's no read on tonight's game... give them all the credit."
  <br>
  <br>
  In Philadelphia, the 76ers' star center Joel Embiid wore a protective mask as he returned after missing one game because of a sinus fracture to score 34 points in a 108-98 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid, who had been expected to sit out at least through Saturday after taking an inadvertent blow to the face last week, added five rebounds, nine assists, two steals and two blocked shots.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 23 points and Kelly Oubre Jr added 22 for Philadelphia, who notched their fourth win in five games as they try to climb into the race for a play-in berth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid has been largely absent from the Sixers' stuttering season. The 2023 NBA Most Valuable Player was appearing in just his seventh game of the campaign after his troublesome left knee delayed his season debut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Oklahoma City Thunder, who fell to the Bucks in the Cup final on Tuesday, notched their second victory since then, beating the Heat 104-97 in Milwaukee.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jalen Williams scored 33 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 25 for the Thunder, who were coming off a victory over the Orlando Magic on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyler Herro scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead the Heat, but Miami clearly missed the contribution of star forward Jimmy Butler, who departed in the first quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game because of illness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Miami's Bam Adebayo departed briefly in the third quarter after taking an accidental elbow over his left eye. He returned after receiving seven stitches and finished with 17 points and 10 rebounds. (AFP)

 Football fans were treated to a nostalgic evening as former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars faced off in a highly anticipated exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The game brought together veteran players from the two iconic clubs, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos for Real Madrid, and Thierry Henry and Xavi Hernández for Barcelona.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s good to see the players,” said football enthusiast Mike.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The people that are here are really enjoying themselves.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Many fans attended the game to watch their favourite players in action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Benjamin, a French native, was excited to see a legend from his home country grace the field again.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I [used to] only see Thierry Henry on TV,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For me, it was an opportunity to see the legendary player [in person].”
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid supporter Carlos shared similar sentiments.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It was really nice [to see Luis Figo play in person]. I saw him 10 years ago back in Madrid, and to see him play here is really nice,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The match ended in a one-sided 5-2 victory for Barcelona. But for many of the spectators, being able to witness the historic rivalry was what mattered most.

    English Rugby Union chairman quits amid pay row

<img alt="Tom Ilube had been facing calls for his removal after a grassroots revolt. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784410_1_20241220203617.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rugby Football Union chairman Tom Ilube has stepped down amid a row over the scale of the governing body's executive bonuses, saying the issue had become a "distraction."
 <br>
  <br>
  The move on Friday follows an outcry over RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney's paycheck of £1.1 million (US$1.37 million) for the 2023/24 financial year, which included a bonus of £358,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Times reported that Bill Beaumont, who held the role from 2012 to 2016 and in November stepped down as World Rugby chairman, is being lined up to fill the position on an interim basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I have decided to step down from my role as chair of the RFU as recent events have become a distraction from the game, but will stay on to ensure a smooth transition to a new chair as soon as one is in place," Ilube said in a statement issued by the RFU.
  <br>
  <br>
  The RFU, which held an emergency council meeting on Wednesday, has announced an independent review of its executive pay scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube had been facing motions calling for his removal after a grassroots revolt gathered enough support to trigger a special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased that an independent review of the LTIP (long-term incentive plan) scheme has been commissioned and look forward to its findings once completed," said Ilube's statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been an honour to chair the RFU and I look forward to once again enjoying the game that I grew up with from the touchline and watching it grow."
  <br>
  <br>
  Many in the game are furious at the amount earned by Sweeney given the RFU reported an operating loss of £37.9 million for the same period, the highest it has ever recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, 42 staff were made redundant in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the pitch, the England men's team won just five of their 12 matches in 2024 and grassroots participation is in decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sweeney's position is also under threat, with a motion for the RFU board to dismiss him set to be tabled at the forthcoming special general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ilube was head of the remuneration committee that signed off the long-term incentive plan that is the basis for the bonuses awarded to Sweeney and other executives. (AFP)

    Wolves appoint Vitor Pereira as new head coach

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wolverhampton Wanderers announced Thursday they had appointed Vitor Pereira as their new head coach as they battle for Premier League survival.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 56-year-old Portuguese manager has left Saudi Pro League club Al Shabab to join Wolves on an 18-month contract after the Midlands side, battling to avoid relegation, sacked Gary O'Neil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely travelled Pereira was close to replacing Rafael Benitez as Everton manager in 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  During an extensive managerial career, Pereira has won two Primeira Liga titles with Porto and the Greek Super League with Olympiakos.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported Tuesday that Wolves would pay around US$1 million to bring Pereira to the English top flight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are delighted to welcome Vitor Pereira to Wolves as the new head coach of our men's first-team," Wolves chairman Jeff Shi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Vitor is a highly respected and experienced coach who has achieved success across different leagues, and will bring a new approach for the test ahead," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a challenging moment for the club, and we want to thank Vitor for taking on this responsibility. We have full confidence in his ability to guide us back on track, alongside the players and staff, and the entire club will be united in supporting him to achieve success."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wolves, second bottom in the Premier League, said Pereira took his first training session with the club on Thursday and would be in charge for their match away to fellow relegation candidates Leicester – five points above them in the standings – on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was sacked after Saturday's 2-1 loss at home to Ipswich, the club's fourth defeat in a row, left Wolves with just nine points from 16 league games.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Neil was appointed in August 2023, following the departure of Julen Lopetegui and signed a new four-year deal with the club in August this year. (AFP)

    US-based Friedkin Group completes Everton takeover

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US-based Friedkin Group has completed the takeover of Premier League strugglers Everton, ending a turbulent period for the club under the ownership of Farhad Moshiri.
 <br>
  <br>
  Everton have been acquired by Roundhouse Capital Holdings Limited, an entity within the Friedkin Group (TFG), the club announced on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Premier League said TFG had purchased a 98.8 percent stake in Everton, which becomes the 10th English top-flight club under majority American ownership – a list that includes Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton said in September that TFG had agreed to buy Moshiri's majority stake subject to regulatory approval, which has now been granted by the Premier League, Women's Professional Leagues Limited, the Football Association and the Financial Conduct Authority.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BBC reported that TFG's deal to buy Everton was worth more than US$500 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Texas-based group is led by chairman Dan Friedkin and also owns Italian Serie A club Roma. Friedkin has a net worth of US$7.7 billion, according to Forbes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I take immense pride in welcoming one of England's most historic football clubs to our global family, the Friedkin Group," Friedkin said in an open letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Incoming executive chairman Marc Watts said "providing immediate financial stability to the club has been a key priority".
  <br>
  <br>
  "While restoring Everton to its rightful place in the Premier League table will take time, today is the first step in that journey," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  British-Iranian businessman Moshiri, who bought a 49.9 percent stake in Everton in 2016, welcomed the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I truly believe that the transaction with the Friedkin Group is the best outcome for the club and its future success," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  American investment firm 777 Partners were unable to complete a deal earlier this year while John Textor, who has a share in Crystal Palace, had previously been in the frame.
  <br>
  <br>
  Everton have twice been sanctioned under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules in the past 13 months, and had eight points in total deducted last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The club have been ever present in the English top flight for the past 70 years but have flirted with relegation in recent seasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are currently 16th in the Premier League table, just three points above the relegation zone.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top tennis player Zhang Zhizhen has chosen Hong Kong as his training ground ahead of the new ATP season, saying the move was “deeply personal”.
 <br>
  <br>
  "When I was 15, I played in the ITF Junior Tournament (Grade 4) here," the world number 45 said in an interview with Hong Kong media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's why I was really looking forward to coming."
  <br>
  <br>
  Having turned pro in 2012, the 28-year-old Shanghai native had a breakthrough in 2022, by becoming the first Chinese male player in the Open era to reach the top 100.
  <br>
  <br>
  He continued to make steady progress, rising to a career-high world number 31 in July this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As the new season approaches, Zhang has set his sights on maintaining his momentum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I want to have a better year (in 2025). Next year, my goal is trying to keep my ranking at around 30," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still seeking his maiden ATP title, Zhang said it would be extra sweet if he could achieve that feat in front of a home crowd at the Shanghai Masters scheduled for September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be an amazing week for me," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton, while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Rare goals from Darwin Núñez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.
  <br>
  <br>
  Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Núñez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was only Núñez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elliott doubled Liverpool in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game, after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Red Bull announced Wednesday that under-pressure Mexican driver Sergio Pérez has departed the Formula One outfit after four seasons, with Liam Lawson tipped to become world champion Max Verstappen's new teammate.
 <br>
  <br>
  Pérez, 34, joined Red Bull in 2021 and helped the team earn two constructors' titles and completed a drivers' standings one-two with four-time world champion Verstappen in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  He won five Grands Prix over 90 starts in Red Bull colours, including a victory at the Monaco GP and a double in Azerbaijan.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the 2024 season, Pérez and Red Bull signed a contract extension, tying the pair together until 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Guadalajara-native's form dropped drastically after that deal and he picked up just nine points from his final eight race weekends.
  <br>
  <br>
  This dip in form led to rumours about his future in the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  He came eighth in the drivers' standings as Red Bull surrendered their team title to McLaren with a third-placed finish.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pérez was adamant during his difficult period that he would stay with the team for next season but he will now part ways with Red Bull with immediate effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm incredibly grateful for the past four years with Red Bull Racing and for the opportunity to race with such an amazing team," Pérez said. "Driving for Red Bull has been an unforgettable experience and I'll always cherish the successes we achieved together."
  <br>
  <br>
  The veteran will not have a seat on the grid next season, but it remains to be seen whether he will sign a deal elsewhere for 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A special thank you to the fans around the world, and especially to the Mexican fans for your unwavering support every day. We'll meet again soon. And remember – never give up," Pérez added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Verstappen hailed his former teammate on social media.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been an absolute pleasure driving alongside you", the Dutchman wrote. "We've had some amazing moments together that I'll always remember. Thank you, Checo [Pérez]!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Red Bull said that "announcements regarding the team's full 2025 line-up will be made in due course".
  <br>
  <br>
  New Zealander Lawson, who currently drives for Red Bull sister team Racing Bulls, is considered the favourite to replace Perez.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 22-year-old has earned three top-10 finishes so far in his fledgling F1 career.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would like to thank Checo for all he has done for Red Bull Racing over the past four seasons," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From the moment he joined in 2021 he proved himself to be an extraordinary team player, helping us to two constructors' titles and to our first 1-2 finish in the drivers' championship," the statement went on to read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While Checo will not race for the team next season, he will always be an extremely popular team member and a treasured part of our history. Thank you, Checo." (AFP)

    Real Madrid sink Pachuca to claim Intercontinental Cup

<img alt="Real Madrid on the pitch after winning the Intercontinental Cup. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784093_1_20241219053405.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kylian Mbappé and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha.
 <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.
  <br>
  <br>
  France striker Mbappé returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mbappé swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the Fifa Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for Concacaf Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vázquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well," Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is Madrid's second title of the season following their Uefa Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carlo Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Muñoz for the most in club history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very pleased, very happy. It's a success – that's more than anyone else," said Ancelotti.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the first edition of the Fifa-backed Intercontinental Cup, which broadly maintains the previous format of the Club World Cup and features the six continental champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latter is being expanded to include 32 teams in 2025 and will now be played every four years. A past version of the Intercontinental Cup ran from 1960 to 2004 involving the champions of Europe and South America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid won that competition three times and then lifted the Club World Cup on a record five occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are to due to play Pachuca again at next year's Club World Cup in the United States, as well as an Al Hilal team including Neymar, and Red Bull Salzburg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Madrid host Sevilla in La Liga on Sunday in their final game of the year. They will return to the Middle East in early January for the four-team Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Real Madrid and Barcelona stars said they are ready to deliver a thrilling show for fans as they face off in an exhibition match at Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The star-studded lineup features a mix of World Cup winners, including Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos of Real Madrid, along with Barcelona’s Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol and Thierry Henry.
  <br>
  <br>
  Michael Owen, the former England striker, and Dutch star Patrick Kluivert are also part of the lineup.
  <br>
  <br>
  Barcelona Heroes’ captain Puyol said he has no plans to travel around the city and wants to stay focused for the match.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's always a special game, because you've been playing against your biggest rival for quite a long time, but not only because they are rivals, but a lot of them are also friends,
  <br>
  because they've been competing also in the national teams. So in the end, it's about the show, to try to put a good show, and people enjoy these kind of matches," he said through an interpreter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Real Madrid Legends’ captain Luis Figo also promised El Clásico would be an exciting match for fans.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think El Clásico is one of the biggest games and derbies in the world, two of the biggest clubs in the world, so the passion is high, the rivalry is very intense... For us now, of course, everyone likes to win, but everyone is retired. We wanted to show a good entertainment game, so we're looking forward to that," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The legendary Portuguese midfielder visited Hong Kong with Real Madrid during their Asia tour in 2003 and scored in a pre-season match against the local team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, of course I remember... We had a great time here, and it's always fantastic to come back to a place that you feel so much support and love. And of course, every time you score is a happiness, because football is a joy. I think you work for that, to make the fans happy, so looking forward for the game," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Event organiser Legend Assemble said they are looking to bring in more football idols to the SAR when the Kai Tak Sports Park opens next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tickets for Friday's match are still available for sale on Klook.com, and students, alongside education and sports groups can enjoy a 25 percent discount.

    Giannis stars as Bucks beat Thunder to win NBA Cup

<img alt="Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with a triple-double in the victory. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783979_1_20241218123712.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks silenced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second half to win the second edition of the NBA Cup with a 97-81 victory in Las Vegas on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo delivered a triple-double of 26 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists along with two steals and three blocked shots for the Bucks, who drilled 17 three-pointers to complete an unbeaten run and follow in the footsteps of the Los Angeles Lakers as in-season tournament champions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Damian Lillard scored 23 points for the Bucks, who held the potentially explosive Thunder offense to 31 points in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's who we are," Antetokounmpo said of the Bucks' second-half surge, which saw them push a one-point lead at halftime to as many as 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 21 points and Jalen Williams added 18 but, with the Bucks thwarting them inside, Oklahoma City were ultimately doomed by their poor long-range shooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The triumph was a vindication for the Bucks, who were stung by the Indiana Pacers in last year's Cup semi-finals.
  <br>
  <br>
  They were the only team from last season's semis to make it back to the final four in Vegas, beating the Orlando Magic in the quarter-finals and dispatching Atlanta in the semis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their Cup success has been part of a massive turnaround after a dismal 2-8 start to the season.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have now won 13 of their last 16 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the rest of the Cup matches, the final doesn't count toward the regular-season record, nor do the players' performances count in their career stats.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the trophy does come with a financial reward with each player on the winning team set to pocket more than US$514,971 – a significant chunk of money for the younger players and lesser lights on the team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thunder players will take home US$205,988 apiece for the runner-up finish. (AFP)

    Vinicius, Bonmatí named Fifa best players of the year

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Real Madrid attacker Vinicius Junior won the Fifa men's player of the year award at a ceremony in Doha on Tuesday, while Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmatí picked up the women's prize for the second time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The award comes two months after 24-year-old Vinicius was second in the Ballon d'Or, with Real electing to snub the ceremony when they found out beforehand that Manchester City midfielder Rodri was set to win the trophy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Brazilian was this time on hand to collect the prize in person as he is in Qatar with his club ahead of their Intercontinental Cup final clash with Mexico's Pachuca.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you very much. I don't know where to start," Vinicius said on stage. "It was impossible to think of getting here. I grew up in a world of poverty, of organised crime. It's for all the children who grow up in that world – I thank everyone who voted for me."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to my family, to the club, to my teammates, to Carletto [Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti], who always helps me," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to everyone who helped make my dream come true. I hope to be at Madrid for many years, because it is the best club in the world," he went on to say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Thank you to Flamengo, my first club in Brazil, and to my teammates in my national team and country who always support my work."
  <br>
  <br>
  Vinicius succeeds Lionel Messi as the Fifa men's player, after the Argentinian scooped up the last two editions of the award.
  <br>
  <br>
  The live wire forward scored 24 goals and laid on 11 assists in 39 matches across all competitions as he led Real to a La Liga and Champions League double last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Spain's Bonmatí picked up the women's player award for the second year running, adding to the two Ballon d'Or trophies she already boasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm grateful, I'm proud to receive this award," Bonmatí said via video link from Barcelona's Olympic stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last term, Bonmatí led Barcelona to a historic continental quadruple of titles and claimed the Nations League with her national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  She won every trophy available to her in club football in the 2023 to 2024 season – the Spanish league, the Copa de la Reina, the Supercopa de España and a second-successive Women's Champions League.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bonmatí scored a goal and put in a player-of-the-match performance, as Barcelona beat Lyon 2-0 in the final of the Champions League to claim their third title in four seasons. (AFP)

 Hong Kong, China have booked a place in the finals of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship in South Korea next year after they crushed Guam in the finale of the qualifying round of the tournament, which the city hosted this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  A goal in each half from Tai Po midfielder Philip Chan, as well as strikes from Benavides Medeiros, Everton Camargo and Dudu, helped seal the 5-0 victory at Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday evening.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win caps a perfect run in the preliminary competition, with the hosts having beaten Mongolia and Chinese Taipei in their previous matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also the sixth straight win under head coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR can now look forward to the EAFF E-1 finals in July 2025, when they will face Asian powerhouses South Korea, Japan and China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US golfers will be paid to play in the Ryder Cup for the first time after the PGA of America unveiled a program on Monday that will give each team member a US$200,000 stipend and US$300,000 to distribute to charity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The program will take effect with the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America said in a statement that its board of directors had voted on the move, which increases the US$200,000 that has been given to each player to distribute to the charities of his choice since the 1999 edition of the biennial match play showdown with Europe was held at Brookline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PGA of America added that no players had asked to be compensated, but the issue of pay for play in the prestigious event has reportedly been a source of tension within the US team in previous editions.
  <br>
  <br>
  USA Today newspaper cited a letter to past Ryder Cup captains from PGA of American president Don Rea, who said the stipend was added "out of respect for the players" and would be separate from what players receive for expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's recognition for all the players have done for the Ryder Cup over the years," Rea wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  When reports of compensation for US players surfaced last month, longtime European Ryder Cup stars Justin Rose and Rory McIlroy said they did not need financial incentives to give their all in the often emotional competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for us, we play for the badge and we also play for the European Tour," Rose said.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Bethpage Black next year Europe will be defending the title they won in Italy in 2023, but they will be chasing their first victory in the event on US soil since the famous "Miracle at Medinah" in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Players on the European Ryder Cup Team do not get paid for participating in the event.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tournament is scheduled for September 26 to 28, when the Americans will try to reclaim the trophy from Europe. (AFP/Reuters)

    Unal last-gasp denies West Ham at Bournemouth

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bournemouth's Enes Unal provided a dramatic climax to his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday as the Turkey forward's superb late free-kick cancelled out Lucas Paquetá's penalty.
 <br>
  <br>
  Paquetá looked to have sealed West Ham's second successive Premier League victory when he converted from the spot with just three minutes left at the Vitality Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Unal came to the Cherries' rescue three minutes later with only his second goal this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 27-year-old's moment of magic extended Bournemouth's unbeaten run to four games as they climbed to sixth place.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Enes scored an amazing goal – he's a specialist. But it's only one point. I'm very disappointed with the penalty," Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola said of the decision that went against his team for Tyler Adams' handball.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is a play we analysed at a meeting before the season," he added. "The refereeing chiefs said players don't need to defend with hands behind their back in an unnatural position. It didn't affect the direction of the cross – I don't care about the explanation now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bournemouth have scored a league-high 10 goals in the final 15 minutes of games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of those goals came in a remarkable 2-1 win at Ipswich in their previous game, with Unal also scoring Bournemouth's equaliser on that occasion.
  <br>
  <br>
  West Ham have gone two games without defeat to ease a little of the pressure on boss Julen Lopetegui.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We suffered a little bit and overcame this to score, but it was an incredible goal from Unal. It's a pity," Lopetegui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are positives," he added. "This is the first step to be strong and a better team."
  <br>
  <br>
  They remain in 14th place and sit seven points clear of the relegation zone. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 European champions England will renew their rivalry with France and the Netherlands, and also clash with debutants Wales in the group stage of the Uefa Women's Euro 2025 tournament after the draw was made in Switzerland.
 <br>
  <br>
  World Cup winners Spain, second in the Fifa rankings and hungry to claim a first Euro title, should have an easier path against Group B opponents Portugal, Belgium and Italy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eight-times European champions Germany, who are ranked third in the world, are in Group C with Poland, Denmark and Sweden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hosts Switzerland will play Norway, Iceland and Finland in Group A and will kick off the tournament on July 2 against the Norwegians in Basel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being holders, Sarina Wiegman's England team were placed in Pot 2 of the draw after finishing second behind France by a point in their Euro qualifying group, with the two teams splitting their qualifying games with identical 2-1 scores.
  <br>
  <br>
  England face France in their group opener on July 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adding more drama to what should be a blockbuster group stage, familiar foes the Netherlands – Wiegman's home country and former team – kept the Lionesses out of the Paris Olympics by finishing ahead of them in the Nations League. The two teams will meet on July 9.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wiegman is the only manager to have won the women's Euros with two different countries, having also lifted the trophy with the Dutch in 2017. (Reuters)

<img alt="The SAR lacrosse squad fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout. Photo courtesy of Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783618_1_20241216121924.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing body for lacrosse has said they will use the success of the Super Sixes tournament to develop star players in the SAR, ahead of the sport’s highly anticipated return to the 2028 Olympic Games.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan took the top spot in the tournament held over the weekend after beating the Philippines, while the SAR squad finished fourth out of five participating teams. They fell just short of the podium after losing 21-9 to powerhouse Germany in the bronze medal bout.
  <br>
  <br>
  The head of the Hong Kong, China Lacrosse Association Raymond Fong on Sunday said the tournament’s success serves as a testament to the sport’s rising popularity in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One thing that is becoming very obvious now is that everyone is improving. If you look at countries like the Philippines and China, compared to where they were last year – they've upped their game."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the results serve as motivation for the local squad to improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So for the Hong Kong team, it's not about just playing the game and maintaining the status quo – it's not the case anymore, and we have to be better and better."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lacrosse is set to make a comeback at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the first time it will be featured at the world’s largest sporting event in over a century.
  <br>
  <br>
  The coach for the SAR's lacrosse squad, Chan Hon-kei, said the experience his team gained from the Super Sixes tournament was a stepping stone towards the possibility of competing at the Olympic level.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We have a lot of hope and expectation for this group to grow to be better, to compete in the world stage. So this tournament really gave us a chance to see the [level of play] that we can be at.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that despite the loss over the weekend, there are a lot of opportunities to develop good players in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started in the grassroots and with a lot of kids, usually starting them young from the age of five," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They can learn all the skills they need, so when they grow up, they have all they need."

    Bills defeat Lions in blockbuster; Chiefs roll on

<img alt="Bills quarterback Josh Allen leaps across the goal line for his second touchdown against the Lions. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783650_1_20241216110904.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Josh Allen delivered another barnstorming performance with two rushing touchdowns, as the Buffalo Bills handed the Detroit Lions only their second defeat of the season with a 48-42 NFL victory at Ford Field on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blockbuster clash between the two high-scoring potential Super Bowl contenders did not disappoint, with Bills quarterback Allen once again underscoring his credentials as the front-runner for this season's Most Valuable Player award.
  <br>
  <br>
  Allen, who rushed for three touchdowns and threw three more in Buffalo's defeat to the Los Angeles Rams last week, was in commanding form with 362 passing yards from 23-of-34 attempts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bills running back James Cook also played a key role with two touchdowns and 105 rushing yards, which included one 41-yard sprint to the end zone in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Buffalo were always in control after racing into an early 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Detroit's offence kept the Lions in touch – with quarterback Jared Goff throwing five touchdowns and 494 passing yards in a game that saw the two teams combine for nearly 1,100 yards of offence.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bills improved to 11-3 with the win, while Detroit fell to 12-2 to leave the Lions tied in the NFC with the Philadelphia Eagles – who defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-13.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for 290 yards with two touchdowns, and rushed for one more to set up the Philadelphia win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for two touchdowns but suffered a late injury scare as Kansas City eased to a 21-7 win over the Cleveland Browns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes limped off the field midway through the fourth quarter of a win that leaves Kansas City on 13-1, putting them on course to secure post-season home-field advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mahomes was uncertain as to the severity of the injury but said he could have played on if needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Usually you have to wait until the day after to get a good sense of it," Mahomes said. "I could have finished the game in different circumstances." (AFP)

    Man Utd deepen Guardiola's gloom; Chelsea cruise

<img alt="Manchester United's Leny Yoro battles for the ball with City midfielder Jack Grealish. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783632_1_20241216101239.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manchester United scored two late goals to deepen the pain for beleaguered Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, as Chelsea moved just two points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.
 <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on a day of high drama in the English top flight, Wolves manager Gary O'Neil and Southampton boss Russell Martin were both sacked, paying the price for their teams' struggles.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the marquee game of the day at the Etihad, City defender Josko Gvardiol opened the scoring, but Bruno Fernandes levelled from the penalty spot in the 88th minute and Amad Diallo struck two minutes later to seal a 2-1 win.
  <br>
  <br>
  Defending champions City – who have dominated English football over the past decade – now have just one win in 11 games in all competitions and Guardiola is desperately searching for answers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't have a defence, I'm the boss, I'm the manager – I have to find a solution, and I don't find a solution," said the Catalan after the low-quality encounter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a big club, when you lose eight out of 11, something wrong is happening," he added. "What can I say? The schedule is tough, the injured players? No. I'm the boss, I'm the manager and I'm not good enough – it's as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guardiola's men trail leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand, by nine points and sit outside the Champions League places, in fifth spot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Injury-ravaged City were far from their best at the Etihad but appeared to be on course for a vital win as the clock ticked down against their neighbours before they self-imploded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Matheus Nunes' sloppy back pass was cut out by Diallo and the Portuguese midfielder then chopped down the United winger in his attempt to make amends.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fernandes coolly converted from the penalty spot to equalise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Diallo then raced onto a simple long ball over the top of City's flat-footed defence, finishing neatly to complete a remarkable turnaround.
  <br>
  <br>
  The win is a huge relief for new United boss Ruben Amorim, who had won just one of his first four Premier League matches.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think for the fans it has a deep meaning, especially in this context, in this moment," the former Sporting Lisbon boss said after his first experience of a Manchester derby.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had a difficult moment one week ago against Nottingham Forest at home with a storm," he added. "It was a really tough moment after the game. Today, we are more happy, but it's three points that we have to continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  United finished the day 13th in the Premier League table – where they started – after Tottenham hammered bottom club Southampton 5-0.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Enzo Maresca's high-flying Chelsea beat Brentford 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to close to within two points of long-time leaders Liverpool, who have 36 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The home team dominated the first half and got the reward they deserved shortly before the break when Marc Cucurella nodded home Noni Madueke's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nicolas Jackson doubled Chelsea's lead in the 80th minute and they held out for the win despite a late strike from prolific Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a fifth straight win for Chelsea, who look increasingly like being Liverpool's main challengers this season, with Arsenal and City faltering. (AFP)

    Haughey claims 5th world title with 200m freestyle win

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday posted the third-fastest time ever recorded for the women’s 200-metre freestyle event, clocking in a time of one minute and 50.62 seconds to capture gold at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest.
 <br>
  <br>
  Haughey, 27, finished nearly a second faster than Canada's Mary-Sophie Harvey, who clocked in a time of one minute and 51.49 seconds.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Claire Weinstein rounded out the podium to take bronze with her one-minute-51.62 second performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey's result stands just behind only her world record, set in 2021 in Abu Dhabi, and Swedish Sarah Sjostrom‘s one minute and 50.43 from 2017. She now owns four of the five fastest times in event history.
  <br>
  <br>
  With that result, the four-time Olympic medallist for the SAR now has four 200-metre freestyle world crowns – along with one other in the 100-metre event.
  <br>
  <br>
  Haughey had recently announced she will be taking a few months off from the sport in the new year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Diogo Jota rescued Liverpool as the Premier League leaders recovered from Andy Robertson's early red card to snatch a 2-2 draw with Fulham, while Arsenal's title challenge was dented by a goalless stalemate against Everton on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  With just four minutes left at Anfield, Arne Slot's side were in danger of losing for just the second time in 15 top-flight games this season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jota grabbed a valuable equaliser as Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches since a loss to Nottingham Forest in September.

  <br>
  With last weekend's Merseyside derby at Everton postponed by severe weather, Liverpool have now gone two league games without a win following their 3-3 draw at Newcastle.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds sit five points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who can close the gap with a win against Brentford at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Liverpool were rocked in the 11th minute as Fulham midfielder Andreas Pereira met Antonee Robinson's cross with an agile volley that deflected in off Robertson.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reds suffered another blow when Scotland left-back Robertson was sent off in the 17th minute for a professional foul on Harry Wilson.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Slot's men have made a habit of coming from behind this season and Cody Gakpo equalised in the 47th minute with a stooping header from Mohamed Salah's cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz delivered a sucker punch as he bundled over the line from Robinson's cross in the 76th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  That set the stage for a dramatic finale as Jota levelled in the 86th minute with a cool finish past Bernd Leno from the edge of the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think I could have asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men," Slot said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's an emotional game. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks."
  <br>
  <br>
  Arsenal failed to take advantage of Liverpool's rare stumble as the Gunners were kept at bay on a frustrating afternoon at the Emirates Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The north Londoners have become a force from set-pieces, scoring 23 goals from corners since the start of last season.
  <br>
  <br>
  But their lack of firepower outside of that route has been questioned this season and once again they were hampered by a failure to turn pressure and possession into goals.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a second successive league draw, third-placed Arsenal remain six points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand on last season's runners-up.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We fully deserved to win the game," Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said. "It's Frustrating, especially when we concede zero chances and dominate the game so much."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nottingham Forest climbed to fourth place after staging a dramatic late fightback to beat Aston Villa 2-1 at the City Ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jhon Duran put sixth-placed Villa in front with a powerful header from John McGinn's 63rd minute cross.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Forest levelled with three minutes left when Nikola Milenkovic's header crept past Emiliano Martinez's weak attempted save.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Anthony Elanga's composed close-range finish in stoppage-time sealed Forest's third victory in their last four games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Newcastle handed Ruud van Nistelrooy his first defeat as Leicester boss with a 4-0 rout at St James' Park.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former Manchester United striker Van Nistelrooy had taken four points from his first two games since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Newcastle ended that encouraging start as Jacob Murphy struck in the 30th minute and Bruno Guimaraes nodded the second goal in the 47th minute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alexander Isak bagged the Magpies' third two minutes later and Murphy netted again on the hour to leave Leicester two points above the relegation zone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jack Taylor's stoppage-time goal gave Ipswich a priceless 2-1 win over relegation rivals Wolves at Molineux.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ipswich went ahead through Matt Doherty's 15th minute own goal before Matheus Cunha grabbed a 72nd minute equaliser.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taylor headed home from a 94th minute corner to seal Ipswich's second league win since their promotion to the top tier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Third-bottom Ipswich are just one point adrift of safety, while second-bottom Wolves are three points behind them after an 11th loss in 16 league games piled further pressure on boss Gary O'Neil. (AFP)

 The SAR's footballers on Saturday evening clinched a 2-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the final Group B match of the East Asia Football Federation (EAFF) E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition at Mong Kok Stadium.
 <br>
  <br>
  Star striker Matt Orr scored for the SAR team before half-time, while defender Tsui Wang Kit scored the winning goal in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was their fifth consecutive victory under new coach Ashley Westwood.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong, China, will play Guam in the final. Guam had earlier defeated Macau 2-1 in a Group A game on Saturday afternoon. The two will square off on December 17 at Hong Kong Stadium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The winner will advance to the tournament in South Korea next summer to play against the hosts, Japan, and the national team.
  <br>
  <br>
  Those three teams automatically qualify for the final round of the competition.

<img alt="Joel Embiid (21) drives for a shot past Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783507_1_20241214203457.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Joel Embiid's tough season took another turn for the worse on Friday as Philadelphia's star center exited early in the 76ers' 121-107 NBA loss to Indiana after being struck in the face.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Cameroon-born big man, who won Olympic gold with the United States in Paris this year, was fighting for a rebound under the Pacers' basket when he was inadvertently elbowed by Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid had 12 points with four rebounds and five assists before departing moments before half-time and the Sixers said after the game he had been diagnosed with a sinus fracture and would be evaluated further over the weekend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Embiid was playing just his second game back after missing seven contests. He has played just six games this season as he battled a troublesome left knee and served a three-game suspension for an altercation with a journalist.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Pacers, fuelled by 32 points and 11 assists from Tyrese Haliburton, led most of the way. Pascal Siakam added 23 points and eight rebounds and Obi Toppin chipped in 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tyrese Maxey scored 22 points to lead Philadelphia, who also saw rookie Jared McCain take a scary hit to the back of the head.
  <br>
  <br>
  McCain needed help from teammate Paul George to get to the free throw line before briefly exiting, but he cleared concussion protocol and returned to the game.
  <br>
  <br>
  The league-leading Cleveland Cavaliers bounced back from a loss to Miami with a 115-105 victory over the Washington Wizards, who suffered their 18th defeat in 19 games.
  <br>
  <br>
  Darius Garland scored 24 points and Jarrett Allen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Cavs, who improved to 22-4 to bolster their lead over reigning champions Boston atop the Eastern Conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington, led by 27 points from forward Bilal Coulibaly, kept it close and led by three early in the third quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cleveland connected on just 39.6 percent of their shots from the field, but they out-shot Washington 28-9 from the free-throw line and parlayed 18 Wizards turnovers into 26 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite their stellar record, Allen said the Cavs need to "keep improving on the little things."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I still think we have a long way to go to be the team that we want to be," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Kevin Durant scored 30 points in his return from injury to help the Phoenix Suns beat the Utah Jazz 134-126.
  <br>
  <br>
  Devin Booker scored 34 points to lead the Suns, who had lost all three games with Durant sidelined by a sprained left ankle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Edwards scored 23 points to lead the Minnesota Timberwolves in a 97-87 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James for a second straight game.
  <br>
  <br>
  Julius Randle scored 21 points, Jaden McDaniels added 18 and Rudy Gobert contributed 12 points and 13 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who beat the Lakers for the second time this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  James, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined again by a sore left foot, but the 39-year-old has also been excused from team activities because of personal reasons and coach JJ Redick said before Friday's game he didn't know when James would return.
  <br>
  <br>
  Anthony Davis carried the Lakers' scoring load with 23 points and 11 rebounds and Austin Reaves returned from a five-game injury absence to score 18.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Lakers, who coughed up 22 turnovers, never led.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Memphis Grizzlies grabbed a fourth straight win, beating the Brooklyn Nets 135-119 behind 28 points and 10 assists from Ja Morant. (AFP)

<img alt="An EAFF E-1 Football Championship preliminary competition between Macau and Guam was held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783495_1_20241214172534.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some football fans from Hong Kong and Macau were left disgruntled over arrangements for a competition held at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.
 <br>
  <br>
  An East Asian Football Federation Championship (EAFF) qualifier between Macau and Guam was held at the sports ground on Saturday, but the Football Association of Hong Kong, China announced a change the night before that meant registration would not be available onsite, and fans would need to reserve a ticket online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expected around 1,000 spectators to come and watch the match. In order to have better crowd control, it was decided by various stakeholders to implement online registration before the match. Registered individuals can collect the physical ticket at the gate," it posted online.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We understand that the arrangements were not ideal but this tournament needs to balance the requirements of and concerns from all government officials. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
  <br>
  <br>
  Two fans from Macau said they were here to support the SAR's team.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope they can improve the arrangements. Even if we have to buy tickets, it's fine, but they should notify us earlier," they told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another local fan said the arrangement was unreasonable, but he wanted to have a look at the new venue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They just announced a day earlier, at about 5 pm, and we had to reserve a ticket at 6 pm. Not everyone monitors the association's social media for ticketing," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association said 400 tickets were distributed online, with the rest sent to local organisations, schools, and participating teams.
  <br>
  <br>
  A man said many fans were disappointed about the arrangement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they require fans to register online, then they should do it at least two to three days in advance, and also specify the quota," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I only found out there were just 400 tickets distributed after I submitted the online form."
  <br>
  <br>
  Guam beat Macau 2-1, and will play in the final at the Hong Kong Stadium next Tuesday.
