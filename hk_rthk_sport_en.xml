  <div class="itemFullText">
   Emirates Team New Zealand completed a commanding 7-2 victory over Ineos Britannia on Saturday to defend the America's Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dominant Kiwis lifted the world's oldest international sporting trophy for the third consecutive time after beating their British opponents by 37 seconds in the ninth race off Barcelona to end the best-of-13 series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand raced into a 4-0 lead in the 37th edition of the competition before Britain fought back with two victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However the Kiwis responded with three points in a row to clinch a third straight victory after their successes in 2017 and 2021, the country's fifth triumph in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "What an amazing feeling, it's been a tough battle all week, but an amazing scoreline and I'm proud of the way the team kept battling today," said Kiwi helmsman Peter Burling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's still just sinking in... what an awesome day, Barcelona's just been absolutely amazing, what an amazing feeling."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ninth race was delayed by 40 minutes because of light wind conditions but eventually began with Ineos knowing they needed to win five straight races to lift the trophy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British boat crossed the start line a knot faster than their opponents and the teams exchanged the lead until New Zealand pulled ahead by 200 metres at the first gate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Kiwis extended their lead to 22 seconds by the second mark but Ineos continued to fight relentlessly and cut the gap to 69 metres at one point in the fourth leg.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The right side of the course offered higher pressure and New Zealand did a good job of defending it, denying Britain a way back in.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Skipper Ben Ainslie and Ineos, bankrolled by billionaire Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, needed a miracle like the comeback from 8-1 down to win Oracle Team USA the America's Cup in 2013, but it was not forthcoming.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Britain have still never won the competition which started 173 years ago with a race around the Isle of Wight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A huge well done to Team New Zealand, what an amazing campaign and team, and in my view they are the best team ever in the America's Cup," said Ainslie.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At the end of the day the better team won.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is not going to be the end of the journey for us, we set out 10 years ago to win the America's Cup, we're getting closer each time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The trick is to keep going and get it home the next time." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The New York Mets kept their magical season going, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-6 on Friday to stay alive in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pete Alonso hit a three-run home run in the first inning and the Mets piled up five runs in the third on the way to an 8-1 lead, then held on to cut the deficit to 3-2 in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers, who were hoping to close out the series at the Mets' Citi Field, instead will host game six on Sunday, again with a chance to return to the World Series for the first time since they won it all in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We'll be ready," Alonso vowed. "We love opportunities."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Andy Pages homered twice for the Dodgers, including a three-run blast that cut New York's lead to 10-5 in the fifth inning. Mookie Betts's solo homer in the sixth pulled the Dodgers within four, but the Mets held on.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte belted three doubles, driving in three runs on four hits for New York. Francisco Lindor and Jesse Winker both plated runs with triples for the Mets, who had 14 hits with no strikeouts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will take on either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, with a three-run homer from Giancarlo Stanton and a tie-breaking pair of runs in the top of the ninth, beat the Guardians 8-6 to take a 3-1 stranglehold on the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, with their backs against the wall, came out firing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They seized a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Alonso's towering home run to center field that also scored Lindor and Brandon Nimmo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pulled a run back with two out in the second when Enrique Hernandez raced home on a wild pitch from Mets hurler David Peterson to Shohei Ohtani.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Mets poured it on in the third when Marte made Dodgers starting pitcher Jack Flaherty pay for walking Alonso and Winker to open the frame, belting a double up the left field line that scored both.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty retired two batters before the Mets put together three straight run-scoring hits to make it 8-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Peterson surrendered a solo home run to Pages in the fourth as the Dodgers continued to press, but the Mets pushed their lead to 10-2 with a pair of runs in the bottom of the fourth and Los Angeles could never close the gap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Cleveland, Stanton crushed his fourth home run of this post-season to power the Yankees, hammering a three-run blast off Guardians relief pitcher Cade Smith to put them up 6-2 in the sixth inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Smith had walked Juan Soto to open the inning. Yankees slugger Aaron Judge cranked a single before a sacrifice bunt from Jazz Chisholm brought up Stanton, who launched a fastball 404 feet into the left field seats.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, stunned by the Guardians' come-from-behind game three victory on Thursday, wasted no time, taking a 2-0 lead in the top of the first on Soto's two-run homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Austin Wells also homered for the Yankees, but the Guardians scored three runs in the seventh inning to pull within 6-5.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland tied it at 6-6 in the eighth when David Fry's soft infield hit was fielded clumsily by Yankees pitcher Mark Leiter, whose toss got past first baseman Anthony Rizzo to allow Fry to second as Bo Naylor – who opened the inning with a double – scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, trying to return to the World Series for the first time since winning their record 27th title in 2009, pushed across two runs in the top of the ninth against Cleveland's star closer Emmanuel Clase and held on for the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They can finish off the series with a victory in game five on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The key is to go play one more game – go out there and try to win that game," Soto said. "Forget about the series, just try to go out there and win the game ... that's all we need to do." (AFP)

    Rugby to trial 20-minute red cards in November Tests
   </title>

  <img alt="The red card variation means that teams can still be reduced to 14 men for the remainder of the game.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Referees will have the option of awarding 20-minute red cards for technical offences during the Autumn Nations Series, organisers announced on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sport's global governing body World Rugby trialled the change in the Rugby Championship earlier this year, allowing a team to replace a red-carded player after 20 minutes in the sin-bin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Importantly for the Autumn Tests, which pitch southern hemisphere teams against those from the north, match officials will also retain the ability to award a permanent red card for acts of foul play which are deemed deliberate and dangerous.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The red card variation ensures that players deemed to commit deliberate and dangerous offences receive the full sanctioning, and subsequent disciplinary process, with the team being reduced to 14 men for the remainder of the game," Six Nations Rugby said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Referees will have the option to award a 20-minute red card for technical offences. This variation on the law trial will run throughout the Autumn Nation Series and differs to the standalone 20-minute red card proposal due to be discussed by the wider game later this year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   National unions in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand back the proposal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But there are others who oppose it, notably France and Ireland. The latter country's union said on Friday it did "not support the permanent adoption of a 20-minute red card," as proposed by World Rugby.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Player welfare and safety are paramount to the core values of the game and the option of a permanent red card for deliberate and intentional acts of foul play supports those values and protects the integrity of the game," the Irish union said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The IRFU welcomes the variation to World Rugby's closed law trial," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other law trials on show in November include kickers having just 60 seconds to complete a penalty or a conversion, the latter with a countdown starting straight after a try is scored.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If a player exceeds this time limit, the conversion kick will be disallowed, while for a penalty, a scrum is awarded to the non-kicking team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There will also be a scrum and line-out clock, with the set-pieces to be formed within 30 seconds of the referee and assistant officials making the respective mark. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mookie Betts homered and finished with four hits and four RBIs for the Los Angeles Dodgers, who took control of the National League Championship Series with a 10-2 win over the New York Mets in Game 4 on Thursday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers lead the best-of-seven series 3-1 and will attempt to clinch the pennant and a trip to the World Series on Friday afternoon, when the teams are scheduled to play Game 5 in New York.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets, who will be playing an elimination game for the second time this month, have been outscored 30-9 in the NLCS.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani homered on the second pitch of the game and walked in each of his next three plate appearances – all of which led to rally-extending hits by Betts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former American League MVP singled and later scored the final run of a two-run third-inning rally before lacing a two-run double in the fourth to extend the Dodgers' lead to 5-2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts added insurance in the sixth, when he greeted Phil Maton with a homer to left.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tommy Edman put the Dodgers ahead for good with a two-out RBI double in the third. Enrique Hernandez followed with a run-scoring single. Edman had a two-run double in the eighth, when Will Smith added an RBI single.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Max Muncy, who started at first base with Freddie Freeman out due to a sore right ankle, walked in his first three plate appearances before singling in the seventh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the 12th straight plate appearance in which he had reached base, tying Reggie Jackson's postseason record. Muncy struck out in the eighth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Evan Phillips, the second of four Dodgers pitchers, earned the win by tossing 1 1/3 scoreless innings. He relieved starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who gave up two runs on four hits and one walk while striking out eight over 4 2/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mark Vientos homered in the first inning and Brandon Nimmo legged out the back end of a potential double-play grounder in the third inning for the Mets, who finished 4-for-22 with runners on base and left the bases loaded twice. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cleveland's David Fry smashed the game-winning home run in the 10th inning on Thursday to give the Guardians a dramatic 7-5 victory over the New York Yankees on Thursday in the Major League Baseball playoffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians, one out from defeat, made a stunning fightback to pull within 2-1 of the Yankees in the in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, which continues Friday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When everybody thinks we can't do it, we think we can," Fry said. "What a win. That was so good – it was fun."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ALCS winner will play in the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers, who meet later Thursday in game four of the National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton hit back-to-back homers in the eighth inning and New York added an insurance run in the ninth for a 5-3 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But in the bottom of the ninth with the hosts down to their final out, Cleveland pinch-hitter Jhonkensy Noel smashed a two-run homer into the left-field stands, the Dominican rookie lifting the Guardians level 5-5 to force extra innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New York stranded two base runners in the top of the 10th, setting the stage for Cleveland's walk-off win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bo Naylor singled and took second base on Brayan Rocchio's sacrifice bunt before Fry smashed the game-winning homer off Yankees relief pitcher Clay Holmes over the left-field wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Not many times do I know the ball has left here to left field, but I had a really good feeling," Fry said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Amazing. I still don't know what happened but it ended up we won," he added. "It's so awesome, it's surreal. We've got a lot more to do, though, but it was fun tonight."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees will try to recover from the near-miss for game four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "They scratched and clawed their way back in," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. "Sucks losing like that, but we'll be ready to roll tomorrow."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees have not reached the World Series since winning their record 27th title in 2009 while Cleveland , which last reached the World Series in 2016, has not captured the crown since 1948. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal admitted his fitness level was well off the tour's top players after falling Thursday in straight sets to fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who described the exhibition match as "a little bit sad".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Nadal, who announced last week he would retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month, lost 6-3, 6-3 to 21-year-old Alcaraz in the semi-finals of the "Six Kings Slam" event in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Afterwards he described Alcaraz, winner of the French Open and Wimbledon this year, as an "animal" and acknowledged he was not competing at the highest level.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have not much pressure here. I'm just trying to have fun," he told a post-match press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I know I'm going to play against players that – are in much better shape than me because they are on the professional tour and winning tournaments."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz said he knew the Saudi crowd was against him but wanted to let Nadal, winner of 22 Grand Slams including 14 French Open titles, bask in the support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a little bit sad – it was not a really comfortable moment for me. Obviously I really wanted to win," said Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Once you step on the court it's no friends, no idols" but "I think this is his moment right now," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to Thursday's match Nadal had made his last singles appearance at the Olympic Games in Paris where his campaign was cut short by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He had also teamed-up with Alcaraz in men's doubles at the Games and may reprise that role at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal will play Djokovic again on Saturday after the Serbian great lost a much tighter match to Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner, who prevailed 6-2, 6-7, 6-4 and will take on Alcaraz in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Having Novak in front, it's like a nostalgic thing," Nadal said, looking ahead to their battle for third place in the Saudi exhibition. "We faced each other plenty of times, so it's going to be good fun to play each other again one more time in this match."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As for the Davis Cup Finals next month, Nadal said he was unclear what his form would be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Emotionally I'm sure I will be ready. In terms of physically, in terms of tennis level – there's still a month to prepare," he said, adding that he would not hesitate to speak up if he thought he could not compete well in singles. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Skipper Rohit Sharma on Thursday said he was "hurting" after opting to bat first on a seaming pitch as hosts India fell to a dismal 46 all out against New Zealand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kiwi fast bowlers Matt Henry and William O'Rourke wreaked havoc in overcast conditions to dismiss India in 31.2 overs on the first Test's second afternoon in Bengaluru.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was India's third-lowest Test score ever and lowest at home, worse than their 75 against the West Indies in New Delhi in 1987.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Their lowest overall is 36 against Australia in a pink-ball Adelaide Test in 2020. They fell for 42 against England at Lord's in 1974.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We felt there was not much grass on the pitch and it will do whatever it has to do in the first couple of sessions and then it is going to take a turn as the game goes on," Rohit told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expected the wicket to be flatter than what it turned out to be. So clearly misjudgement of the pitch," he added. "Obviously, I didn't read the pitch enough and we sit in that situation today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Five Indian batsmen including Virat Kohli got out for a duck as Henry and O'Rourke shared nine wickets between them in a rare show of domination by opposition bowlers in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am hurting a little bit because I made that call," said Rohit. "But we want to challenge ourselves. This time it didn't come off, the challenge that was thrown at us."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Former captain Tim Southee drew first blood as he bowled Rohit through the gate. Fellow quick O'Rourke silenced the crowd when he sent back Kohli for nought.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Henry wrapped up the innings with a five-wicket haul and his last strike of Kuldeep Yadav was his 100th Test wicket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a good toss to lose," said Henry. "It was quite nice when those clouds started coming in. I think we were expecting it to be a flatter wicket but there was plenty of assistance this morning – it was great that we could make the most of it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Zealand have the upper hand with a lead of 134 as they ended the day on 180-3 after Devon Conway's 91. Henry warned his team against letting their guard down.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We can't be complacent at all," he said. "We've just got to keep mounting pressure." (AFP)

  <img alt="South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt (R) and Anneke Bosch celebrate during the match. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775077_1_20241018082054.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A superb 74 not out from Anneke Bosch fired South Africa into the Women's T20 World Cup final as they demolished defending champions Australia by eight wickets in Dubai on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Set 135 to win, South Africa reached their target with 16 balls to spare, with Bosch, who struck eight fours and a six in her 48-ball innings, sharing a match-winning partnership of 96 with skipper Laura Wolvaardt (42).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Sunday's final, which will be the first not to feature one of Australia or England, the South Africans will face either West Indies or New Zealand who meet in the second semi-final on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia, who have won six of the previous eight editions, had been the odds-on favourites to win a seventh title in the United Arab Emirates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they had no answer to South Africa for whom this marked a measure of revenge for defeat by Australia in last year's final in Cape Town.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think this is one of the best wins of my cricketing career for sure. A couple of other girls have said it as well," said Wolvaardt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that was such an amazing chase," she added. "The bowlers are excellent. It's been a good year for us – I think it's been a real collective group effort." (AFP)

    Formula One to drop fastest lap bonus point

  <img alt="The FIA made the announcement ahead of the United States Grand Prix. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775074_1_20241018081351.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Formula One is scrapping from next year the award of a bonus point for fastest lap in a race, introduced with much fanfare just five years ago, governing body the FIA said Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bonus point was awarded originally in the 1950s, but then dropped before being reintroduced in 2019 for the lap, if the driver finishes in the top ten.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has potential significance in a long season of 24 races, as this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FIA (International Motoring Federation) made the announcement ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix among changes to the 2024 and 2025 sporting and technical regulations after approval by the World Motor Sport Council.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In another change, a requirement to run a young driver during free practice is to increase from once per car per season to twice per car per season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The significance of the fastest lap was shown at last month's Singapore Grand Prix where RB's Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo pitted for new tyres to set the fastest lap in his final race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RB are a sister team to Red Bull and thereby deprived rivals like McLaren and their title-challenging driver Lando Norris of a possible additional point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Norris held the fastest lap and bonus point as the race entered its final laps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ricciardo was 18th and not eligible to score a bonus point, but he was called to pit and duly set the lap, depriving Norris of a point. (AFP)

    Alcaraz to face Nadal in Six Kings Slam semis

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774910_1_20241017082310.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Carlos Alcaraz admitted Wednesday it will be a "difficult moment" facing "idol" Rafael Nadal when the Spanish superstars clash for the final time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal, the winner of 22 Grand Slam titles, announced last week that he will retire from tennis after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, however, the 38-year-old will take on Alcaraz for a place in the final of the "Six Kings Slam" exhibition event in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Since I started to play tennis, I'm watching his matches. I look up to him and I grew up watching him. He was my idol, he is still my idol," Alcaraz said on court after defeating Holger Rune 6-4, 6-2 to set-up an emotional meeting with Nadal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A really important person for my life, for my career and he was one of the reasons that I wanted to become a professional tennis player. Knowing he is going to retire is pretty tough for everyone, for me."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alcaraz, the reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion, added: "I will try to enjoy sharing the court with him once again, but I think it is really difficult for everyone."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal and Alcaraz have met three times on the main ATP Tour with the soon-to-be retired veteran holding a 2-1 advantage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spanish pair played doubles together at the Paris Olympics this year and they are expected to team-up again at the Davis Cup Finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal also made his last singles appearance at the Games on the same Roland Garros courts where he won 14 French Open titles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His Olympic singles campaign was ended by old rival Novak Djokovic in the second round.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's other semi-final in Riyadh sees Djokovic tackle Australian Open and US Open champion Jannik Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number one Sinner eased past Daniil Medvedev 6-0, 6-3 on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The semi-final against Novak will be a different match than the ones we played in the past," said Sinner who defeated the 24-time Grand Slam title winner in the Shanghai Masters final last Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We know each other quite well and we know what to expect from each other," the 23-year-old added. "I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, but I am just trying to play the best possible tennis, and we will see how it goes." (AFP)

    Pogba 'willing to give up money' to stay at Juventus

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paul Pogba is adamant that he wishes to return from his reduced doping ban with Juventus even if it means accepting a pay cut, the French World Cup winner told La Gazzetta dello Sport in an interview Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm willing to give up money to be able to play again with Juve, I want to come back with this club," said Pogba in an interview published on the Italian sports daily's website. "The reality is that I am a Juve player and I am preparing to play for Juve."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's contract with the Italian giants expires in June 2026 and is currently worth US$8.6 million a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his ongoing suspension, the midfielder receives only the minimum salary stipulated in the Serie A collective agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, since Pogba's ban was reduced, Italian press have reported that Juventus are nonetheless seeking to terminate his contract.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It will be a new Pogba, a hungrier, wiser and stronger one – I just want to play football," added the former Manchester United star.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to be ready to train and play for Juve, I'm a Juve player," he added. "In my mind, that's all there is at the moment."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba had his four-year ban for doping reduced to 18 months earlier in October by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and can return to action from March 11 next year, four days before his 32nd birthday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 after a match between Juventus and Udinese in Italy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was provisionally suspended in September of the same year, and then banned for four years by the Italian National Anti-Doping Tribunal the following February.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pogba's representatives said the testosterone came from a food supplement prescribed by a doctor he consulted in the United States. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aaron Judge smacked his first home run of the Major League Baseball playoffs and the New York Yankees beat Cleveland 6-3 on Tuesday, seizing command of the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge broke open a tight game with his two-run blast in the seventh inning as the Yankees grabbed a 2-0 lead in the best-of seven series, which continues on Thursday in Cleveland.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We've got to keep things the same," Judge said. "It's going to be a loud environment, a fun environment. We've got to go out there and keep playing our game – feed off the energy and go from there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The series winner advances to the World Series against either the New York Mets or Los Angeles Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yankees slugger Judge, whose 58 regular-season homers led MLB, crushed a blast over the centerfield wall to give New York a 6-2 lead with his 14th career playoff homer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was good to add two more runs there," Judge said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians stranded 11 base runners as four Yankees relief pitchers baffled Cleveland after starter Gerrit Cole went only 4 1/3 innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These guys came in, they're healthy, they're feeling great, some great performances from quite a few guys at the back end," Judge said of New York's relievers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are seeking their first trip to the World Series since winning it for the record 27th time in 2009, while Cleveland has not reached the event since 2016 and last won a World Series in 1948. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   A Swedish prosecutor on Tuesday said – without mentioning Kylian Mbappé – that a rape investigation had been opened, after media reported that the Real Madrid and France star was the suspect during a visit to Stockholm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In response to media reports about a suspected rape in Stockholm, the prosecutor can confirm that a criminal report has been submitted to the police," Sweden's Prosecution Authority said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that the alleged incident occurred at a hotel on October 10, but did not name a suspect and said no further information could be shared for the moment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Swedish newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen, as well as public broadcaster SVT, on Tuesday reported that 25-year-old Mbappé was the target of the investigation, following his two-day visit to the Swedish capital last week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The French international visited Stockholm with a group of people last Thursday, as he was not selected for his country's latest round of Nations League matches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to Aftonbladet, the group dined at a restaurant before going to a nightclub, and left Sweden last Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said the complaint was filed last Saturday after the alleged victim had sought medical attention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expressen reported on Tuesday that police had seized some clothing as evidence, saying it consisted of women's underwear, a pair of black trousers and a black top.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Monday, citing anonymous sources, Expressen identified Mbappé as the suspect, while Aftonbladet and SVT said on Tuesday they had also had obtained information confirming Mbappe was the suspect.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response, Mbappé on Monday posted on X that there was a link between the Aftonbladet report and his hearing before a French league committee on Tuesday, in his dispute with his former club Paris Saint-Germain over what he says are unpaid wages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "FAKE NEWS !!!!. It's becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance," Mbappé said in the post.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mbappé claims he is owed US$60 million by the Qatari-owned French champions. (AFP)

    Tuchel set to be unveiled as new England manager

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Thomas Tuchel is set to be named England's new manager after agreeing a deal with the Football Association (FA), multiple British and German media outlets reported on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Times, Sky Sports, the BBC and German newspaper Bild said that Tuchel, 51, will be named as the permanent successor to Gareth Southgate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee Carsley was put in temporary charge of England in August following Southgate's resignation shortly after losing the final of Euro 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The FA declined to comment on the reports but said that CEO Mark Bullingham will provide an update on Wednesday at Wembley Stadium when the appointment is expected to be confirmed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The German, who has been out of work since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season, would become just the third foreign manager of the Three Lions after Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Germany reported he will sign an 18-month deal from January 1, 2025 until the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former coach of Borussia Dortmund, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern, Tuchel has the trophy-winning pedigree that the FA is seeking to help end a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the move has drawn criticism over the FA's unwillingness to trust an English coach with its top job.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel won league titles at PSG and Bayern and the German Cup with Dortmund, but his greatest success came during his time in English football at Chelsea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He led the Blues to Champions League glory just months after taking charge in 2021 and also won the Uefa Super Cup and Club World Cup with the London club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tuchel was sacked in September 2022 in a bold early move by Chelsea's new ownership group that did not pay off. (AFP)

    Brady to become part-owner of NFL's Las Vegas Raiders

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady was approved as a member of the Las Vegas Raiders ownership group on Tuesday by NFL team owners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, who played 23 NFL seasons before retiring in 2022, will hold a 5 percent stake in the Raiders, who are off to a 2-4 start this season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The approval at an owners meeting in Atlanta ends an 18-month saga since the first reports of Brady seeking a share of the partnership group that owns the club.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Delays in the deal reportedly included figuring out an exact percentage for Brady and issues around his current role as an NFL television analyst for Fox Sports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two months ago, the NFL put some restrictions on Brady's broadcast access because of his possible involvement with the Raiders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady is banned from attending in-person or online broadcast production meetings and is not allowed access to players, coaches or team facilities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While he is permitted to broadcast Raiders contests, Brady must follow NFL rules banning criticism of other teams or officials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brady, 47, spent 20 seasons with the New England Patriots, leading them to six NFL titles, and captured his last crown with Tampa Bay in 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He set NFL career records with 7,753 completions from 12,050 attempts for 89,214 yards and 649 touchdowns. (AFP)

  <img alt="Dave Jakins, aka the 'King Conker', denies allegations he used a steel conker to win the tournament.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The World Conker Championships said on Tuesday it was investigating allegations of cheating after this year's men’s winner was found to have a steel chestnut in his pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 200 enthusiasts of the traditional game entered the annual competition on Sunday in the small village of Southwick in central England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The game involves players using conkers – the glossy brown seeds from the horse chestnut tree – threaded onto a string to try and smash their opponent’s chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each player takes three alternate strikes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Veteran player Dave Jakins, 82, won the men's tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But organisers said they launched an investigation after claims that he may have used a steel chestnut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The allegations were raised by Alastair Johnson-Ferguson, who lost in the men’s final against Jakins after his conker “disintegrated in one hit," The Telegraph newspaper reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers confirmed a steel conker was found in Jakins' pocket.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investigations were ongoing, but they said that it appeared unlikely that he was able to cheat under the scrutiny of judges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jakins has denied the allegations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “He was very closely watched by four judges. It looks like it was absolutely impossible for him to cheat,” St. John Burkett, chair of the event's organising committee, told Sky News.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The title of World Conker Champion went this year to Kelci Banschbach, originally from Indianapolis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 34-year-old was crowned “queen conker” after beating Jakins in the final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She was the first American to win the title since the World Conker Championships began in 1965. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Organisers on Tuesday confirmed that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will compete in the Hong Kong Open tennis championships later in October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Osaka, who won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020, is the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam and the first player from Asia to hold the singles' top ranking, claiming the World No. 1 spot in January 2019, which she held for 21 weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She will be joined by Russia's Diana Shnaider and Anastasia Potapova, who is ranked 37th in the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Twenty-year-old Shnaider is the youngest player currently ranked in the world's top 16, and has won three titles this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the 2024 Olympic Games, she partnered with Mirra Andreeva to capture the silver medal in the women's doubles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Other international stars already confirmed to compete in the event include defending champion Leylah Fernandez of Canada, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania and Britain's highest-ranked player Katie Boulter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's Paris Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Wang Xinyu, and rising stars Yuan Yue and Wang Xiyu will also feature in the field competing for a total prize purse worth US$250,000. (Xinhua)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Captain Ben Stokes was named in the England team for the second Test against Pakistan starting in Multan on Tuesday after recovering from a hamstring injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stokes suffered the injury two months ago and missed the three-match home series against Sri Lanka and last week's first Test, which the visitors won by an innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Durham seamer Matthew Potts also returns to the side for the first time since the Lord's Test against Sri Lanka at the end of August. Seamers Gus Atkinson and Chris Woakes are rested.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Look, it's obviously got to be sensible," said talismanic all-rounder Stokes on Monday after he was declared fit, having been bowling in the nets since before the first Test.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm obviously playing as a third seamer," he added. "I'm available to bowl and obviously when I sense the time is right for me to maybe come on and make an impact there won't be any doubts in my mind that I can come on and bowl."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England won the first Test, also in Multan, by an innings and 47 runs on Friday, with Ollie Pope leading the side in Stokes's absence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England rode on a brilliant 317 from Harry Brook and 262 from Joe Root for a stunning victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan became the first team in Test cricket's 147-year history to lose by an innings after posting a 550-plus total in their first knock. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mark Vientos smashed a grand slam and Francisco Lindor homered as well as the New York Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 on Monday to level their Major League Baseball playoff series at one game apiece.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vientos's four-run home run in a determined second inning at-bat helped the Mets rebound from a 9-0 drubbing in game one on Sunday in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lindor led off the game with a 395-foot home run off Dodgers hurler Ryan Brasier, ending the Dodgers pitching staff's record-equalling streak of 33 scoreless innings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dodgers hurlers hadn't surrendered a run since the second inning of game three of their division series against the San Diego Padres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One inning later, Vientos got the better of Dodgers reliever Landon Knack, fouling off five pitches before crushing the ninth pitch he saw – a 95 mph fastball – over the center field seats for a grand slam home run that pushed the Mets' lead to 6-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Starling Marte had opened the inning with a single off Knack and scored on Tyrone Taylor's double that left runners at second and third. Lindor was intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up Vientos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 24-year-old admitted he "took it personally" when the Dodgers walked Lindor to bring him to the plate but said he "wasn't trying to do too much."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets will host games three and four on Wednesday and Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think we're in a great spot," Vientos said. "I like the momentum we got. I like the energy we brought in this day game and we've got to keep it going.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Max Muncy hit a solo homer for Los Angeles in the fifth, but the Dodgers' vaunted lineup was largely silenced. Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was 0-for-3 with two strikeouts and two walks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will advance to the World Series against either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the Yankees, fueled by home runs from Giancarlo Stanton and Juan Soto, beat the Guardians 5-2 to open their American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland pitcher Alex Cobb walked three of the next five batters before he was replaced by Joey Cantillo, who threw a couple of wild pitches into the dirt against the next two Yankees batters, allowing Aaron Judge and Stanton to score for a 3-0 New York lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, owners of 27 World Series titles, are chasing their first appearance in a World Series since they beat Philadelphia for the crown in 2009.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians are seeking their first World Series appearance since 2016 and their first title since 1948. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Germany secured a place in the Uefa Nations League quarter-finals with a 1-0 win over old rivals the Netherlands on Monday, while France won in Belgium and Italy continued their recent revival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jamie Leweling of Stuttgart scored on his debut to give Germany victory over the Netherlands in Munich and guarantee them one of the top two spots in Group 3 of League A.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was the eighth meeting of the teams in the last six years but, for the Dutch, there was nothing familiar about Leweling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23-year-old was an addition to the Germany squad for this month's games following an injury to Jamal Musiala.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was then called off the bench to start the game after an injury to club teammate Deniz Undav in the warm-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leweling found the net after just two minutes only for that effort to be ruled out for an offside in the build-up, but he then blasted in the winner on 64 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Jamie had an outstanding debut – it's not often the Allianz Arena gives you a reception like that – he did well," said captain Joshua Kimmich.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Germany have 10 points from four games and will definitely take part in the quarter-finals next March.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Netherlands, who were without the suspended Virgil van Dijk, are level on five points with Hungary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hungarians won 2-0 on Monday away in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with captain Dominik Szoboszlai, of Liverpool, opening the scoring late in the first half and adding a penalty after the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy remain top of Group A2 after easing to a 4-1 win at home to Israel in Udine. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Los Angeles pitcher Jack Flaherty dominated over seven scoreless innings and the Dodgers shut out the New York Mets 9-0 on Sunday in game one of Major League Baseball's National League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mookie Betts delivered a three-run double. Max Muncy drove in two runs and Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani singled in a run and electrified the Dodger Stadium crowd with a hit that threatened to clear the outfield wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it was more stellar pitching, backed by lockdown defense and a disciplined performance at the plate that propelled the Dodgers to victory in game one of the best-of-seven series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers pitchers have now tied the major league post-season record of 33 consecutive scoreless innings, set by the Baltimore Orioles over the first four games of the 1996 World Series against the Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Each and every one of the pitchers has been doing their job exceptionally well and it's really setting the tone for the offensive part of the game to be able to feel comfortable and score runs," Ohtani said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dodgers will try to double their series lead when they host game two on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will advance to the World Series to face either the New York Yankees or Cleveland Guardians, who are set to clash in the American League Championship Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It started with Flaherty, who retired the first nine batters he faced, giving up two hits and two walks with six strikeouts before departing with the Dodgers up 6-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile Mets starting pitcher Kodai Senga lasted just four outs, his inability to throw strikes proving costly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After retiring Ohtani to start the bottom of the first, Senga walked three straight batters to load the bases then gave up a single to Muncy that scored two runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He walked Gavin Lux to open the second. Lux advanced to second on a sacrifice fly and scored when Ohtani cracked a sharp single to right field, spelling the end of Senga's day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He just didn't have it together," Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani, serenaded with chants of "MVP" whenever he was at the plate, scored on a bloop single to left field by Freddy Freeman and it was 6-0 Dodgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flaherty got through the fifth without giving up a run with help from the Dodgers defense. Mets designated hitter Jesse Winker led off the inning with a single.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jose Iglesias followed with a single and when Winker hesitated trying for third he was caught for the first out of another scoreless inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Betts boosted the score in the bottom of the eighth, belting a bases-loaded double to left field that scored all three runners and made it 9-0 – the most lopsided shutout win in Dodgers playoff history. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya obliterated the women's world record by almost two minutes on Sunday as she won the Chicago Marathon in 2 hours, 9 minutes and 56 seconds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 30-year-old Chepngetich, who became the first three-time women's winner of the Chicago race, broke the previous world record of 2hours, 11minutes 53 seconds set by Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa last year in Berlin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I feel so great, I'm proud of myself. This is my dream that has come true," said Chepngetich, the 2019 world marathon champion. "I've fought a lot, thinking about the world record and I have fulfilled it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the absence of Olympic champion Sifan Hassan, the 2023 Chicago winner, Chepngetich set a blazing early pace and reached the halfway point in 1:04:16, the fifth-quickest time in history for a half marathon by a woman.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The weather was perfect and I was well prepared. The world record was in my mind," said Chepngetich, runner-up to Hassan 12 months ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At one point, Chepngetich was on track to shave more than three minutes off the world record.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She slowed slightly in the closing kilometres but still had plenty in the tank and beat her own personal best by four-plus minutes, which she had clocked when winning the race two years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ethiopia's Sutume Kebede came second on Sunday, while Chepngetich's Kenyan compatriot, Irine Cheptai, finished third. (AFP)

    Bears defeat Jaguars in London for third straight win

  <img alt="Bears quarterback Caleb Williams carries the ball against Jaguars' linebacker Ventrell Miller. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774373_1_20241014081800.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Caleb Williams threw four touchdown passes – two each to receiver Keenan Allen and tight end Cole Kmet – and the Chicago Bears held a tea party celebration in the end zone in a 35-16 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Along with the rookie quarterback's big day, Kmet chipped in by handling emergency long-snapping duties as the Bears won their third straight game for the first time in nearly four years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Allen led a tea party celebration after his 9-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter and his second score gave Chicago a 28-10 early in the fourth. D'Andre Swift added a 1-yard plunge for the Bears.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Jaguars started fast but Gabe Davis dropped a pass in the end zone – after he was whistled for a false start – and Jacksonville settled for a field goal on its opening drive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Davis later caught two second-half touchdown passes from Trevor Lawrence – the second made the score 35-16.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kmet broke two tackles on a 31-yard touchdown reception to give Chicago a 7-3 lead in the second quarter when the Bears mixed in no-huddle to spark their offense. He then snapped for the extra point because long snapper Scott Daly left the game earlier with a knee injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams found Kmet in the end zone with 13 seconds left in the half to complete an 85-yard drive than included the rookie quarterback scrambling for 23 yards on one play and 19 on another.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Williams, the No. 1 pick in this year's NFL draft, finished 23 of 29 for 226 yards with the four TD passes and one interception. He picked up 56 yards on four carries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jags coach Doug Pederson, who got a vote of confidence from ownership on Saturday, told the NFL Network at halftime while trailing 14-3 that his team had “self-inflicted wounds.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jags tight end Evan Engram, in his first action since Week 1, fumbled after a reception on Jacksonville’s first drive of the third quarter. The Bears turned that into points when Allen scored his first touchdown with the team.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lawrence completed 23 of 35 passes for 234 yards, two touchdown passes and one interception. Engram had 10 catches for 102 yards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is Chicago's first three-game winning streak since late in the 2020 season. (AP)

    Sabalenka outlasts Zheng to win third Wuhan Open title

  <img alt="Sabalenka reacts after winnning a point against China’s Zheng Qinwen. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774370_1_20241014080943.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Aryna Sabalenka became the first player to win the Wuhan Open three times by defeating local hero Zheng Qinwen 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the final on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The top seed, who also triumphed at the event in 2018 and 2019, kept her undefeated record in Wuhan intact, improving to a perfect 17-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka was put to the test by a gritty Zheng in a rematch of the 2024 Australian Open final before she captured an Open era record fifth title on Chinese soil.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With two Grand Slam titles and a WTA 1000 success in Cincinnati under her belt already in 2024, Sabalenka picked up her fourth trophy of the season from seven finals reached.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 26-year-old strengthened her chances of ending the year as the world number one ahead of Iga Swiatek, a battle likely to come down to the wire at the WTA Finals in Riyadh next month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "That's a really tight ranking right now. Really nice to see," said Sabalenka, who trails Swiatek in the world rankings by less than 100 points. "We'll see after the finals if I was good enough this season to become world number one."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zheng had never taken a set off of Sabalenka in any of their previous three meetings, which have all come on the Grand Slam stage and in the past 13 months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Sunday's final was a different story, with Zheng, the reigning Olympic gold medallist, competing in front of her home fans in the city where she grew up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka broke for a 4-2 advantage on a Zheng double-fault in front of a capacity crowd of 13,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Belarusian wrapped up the 38-minute opening set with her second ace of the match, dropping just five points on serve along the way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   22-year-old Zheng, meanwhile, can still take positives from her week in Wuhan, where she is the first Chinese finalist in tournament history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She has made a crucial jump in the Race to the WTA Finals, from number nine to number seven, increasing her chances of becoming the first Chinese player to qualify for the season-ending championships since Li Na in 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That could come down to the WTA 500 tournament in Ningbo next week but Zheng said she has not decided yet whether she'll play after being troubled by a fever over the past two weeks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm feeling a little bit weak in my health. I will need to be really cautious," Zheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Competing in Ningbo is important, but my health is also important," she added. "I need to find the balance between the two." (AFP)

    Sinner wins in Shanghai to deny Djokovic 100th title

  <img alt='In a nod to Roger Federer, who was watching from the stands, Jannik Sinner joked: "There are legends everywhere, I just try to keep up a little bit."

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner defeated 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 on Sunday to win the Shanghai Masters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner took a crucial break in the fourth game of the second set to defeat the Serb in 1hr 37min and deny him a 100th career singles title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He was just too good today, too strong, too fast," said Djokovic after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner saluted his opponent as a "legend" who kept playing "incredible tennis... year after year."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a nod to former Djokovic rival Roger Federer, who was watching from the stands, the 23-year-old joked: "There are legends everywhere, I just try to keep up a little bit."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Facing off before an impassioned crowd, neither player blinked in the first set, unable to break the other's serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the tiebreak Sinner quickly took control, breaking Djokovic's serve on the first point and going 5-1 up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Serb steadied himself but then netted a volley to bring up set point at 6-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner failed to convert initially but didn't miss the second time behind serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The next key moment came in the fourth game of the second set, when Sinner was up 40-15 on Djokovic's serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Djokovic saved one break point with a fiery ace, but couldn't stop a superb forehand down the line from Sinner that saw him pull ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All that remained was for the Italian to hold his nerve, hitting an ace to finish the match and claim the title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner's triumph caps off a formidable year, in which he has won two Grand Slams and retained the top spot in the rankings since June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it is also a year that has seen him embroiled in controversy after he twice tested positive for a banned steroid in March.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted Sinner's explanation that the drug entered his system unintentionally when his physiotherapist used a spray containing it to treat a cut, then provided massage and sports therapy to the player.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But last month the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said it would appeal the decision to clear him of wrongdoing and was seeking a ban of up to two years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That news came as Sinner was contesting the China Open, where he lost in the final to Spain's Carlos Alcaraz, who was also watching from the stands on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He admitted coming into the Shanghai tournament that he was "not in a situation where I feel comfortable in it." (AFP)

  <img alt="World number four Yin Ruoning immediately wiped out Mao Saigo's lead at the start of the round, carding a birdie on the first. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774325_1_20241013183356.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Yin Ruoning said she had "goosebumps" after six birdies on the back nine in a spectacular final round of 64 on Sunday gave her a six-stroke victory at the Buick LPGA Shanghai, her first tour win at home in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 22-year-old Shanghai native and former world number one finished on 25-under par, roared all the way by her hometown crowd, having begun the day one stroke behind Japan's Mao Saigo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saigo's one-under 71 left her sharing second place on 19-under with Kim Sei-young of South Korea, who carded a four-under 68.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's amazing to be able to win at home," said Chinese number one Yin following a victory romp over the closing nine holes that thrilled her legion of fans in her home city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The crowd is amazing, people shouting my name and rooting for me," added Yin, who said she was looking to see her mother but couldn't manage it among the large galleries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This tournament really, really means a lot to me and I'm just so happy I'm able to win," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At just 22, Yin now has four LPGA wins including one major – last year's Women's PGA Championship.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked what comes next, she said: "We'll see."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Let me finish today and just have fun with my mom, and we'll think about it later."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kim, another former number one, had led for the first two rounds after a dazzling 62 on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fourth was Yealimi Noh of the United States, whose final-round 67 left her seven strokes adrift of Yin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My best finish of the year, so it's been really nice," said Noh, describing it as a "solid week".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I just hit it really well which was really surprising and I was grateful... because I had some back problems coming into the week," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number four Yin immediately wiped out Saigo's lead at the start of the round, carding a birdie on the first.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She edged in front with another on the fifth before her back-nine birdie barrage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai sensation was met with a champagne shower and a roar from the packed crowds around the 18th as a final birdie sealed the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It gives me goosebumps when I think about it right now," Yin told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I mean, all the fans, the energy, it's just phenomenal." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome and Hong Kong's two-time Olympic medallist Sarah Lee were among those who took part in this year's Hong Kong Cyclothon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 50-kilometre race kicked off in Tsim Sha Tsui at around 5.15am on Sunday, and the route includes Tsing Ma Bridge, Ting Kau Bridge and Stonecutters Bridge, as well as several tunnels.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Froome said he very much enjoyed his first Cyclothon, as the ride in Hong Kong is very different from racing in Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Seeing Hong Kong by bike through all the main roads, it's just such a pleasure. I think these are roads that cyclists would never normally get the chance to enjoy," the British rider said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So to be able to really take in the city, take in the surroundings, yeah, just such an amazing experience."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lee, for her part, said while it's her third time taking part in the Cyclothon, this is the first time where she wasn't going for speed and has more time to enjoy the experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the most beautiful part of the route is the Stonecutters Bridge. Usually you look at the bridge from the pier, you already find it beautiful -- but when you actually ride a bike on the bridge it's a different feeling," she told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In terms of difficulty, it's really the general situation in Hong Kong, you have to make sharp U-turns in many places [along the route]. If there are earlier traffic signs about them, it'd be better."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Organisers said a record 6,000 people joined this year's Cyclothon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As part of the event, the Tourism Board also hosted a sports carnival at the West Kowloon Cultural District, with local food stalls, yoga sessions and freestyle cycling performances all part of the programme.

    Ronaldo powers Portugal; Spain break Denmark's heart

Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774269_1_20241013095447.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cristiano Ronaldo scored as Portugal beat Poland 3-1 for their third straight Nations League win on Saturday, while European champions Spain put an end to Denmark's perfect start in the competition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bernardo Silva volleyed Portugal ahead in the 26th minute in Warsaw as Bruno Fernandes cleverly nodded a cross from Ruben Neves back towards the Manchester City midfielder.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ronaldo then found himself in the right place at the right time to turn in the rebound for Portugal's second after Rafael Leao's shot came back off the post following a brilliant surging run by the AC Milan winger.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 39-year-old Ronaldo has now struck in all three games of this Nations League campaign for Portugal, taking his record men's international goals tally to 133.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Piotr Zielinski cut the deficit for Poland but Jan Bednarek's own goal sealed victory for Portugal, the lone remaining team in League A with a 100 percent record, and they could secure a place in the quarter-finals next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We worked very hard the last few days, preparing various solutions for this game, and we were able to show it on the pitch. I am really satisfied because we controlled this game," said Portugal coach Roberto Martinez. "We played great as a team."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Portugal have a maximum nine points in Group A1, three ahead of Croatia who beat Scotland 2-1 to condemn their opponents to a third successive defeat in the section.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ryan Christie's first half-goal gave Scotland a shock lead in Zagreb, but Igor Matanovic equalised before the interval and Andrej Kramaric bagged the winner midway through the second half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Che Adams thought he had salvaged a stoppage-time equaliser but VAR disallowed his effort for offside, with Scotland winless in nine competitive outings -- the longest run in their history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain needed a 79th-minute effort from Martin Zubimendi to shrug off Denmark 1-0 in Murcia as captain Alvaro Morata showed off the European Championship trophy to fans before kick-off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The hosts were without Rodri and Dani Carvajal, both sidelined by long-term injuries, with first-choice goalkeeper Unai Simon still recovering from wrist surgery. Nico Williams, Dani Olmo and Robin Le Normand had also been ruled out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Luis de la Fuente's team grabbed the only goal when Zubimendi's low drive from just outside the area squirmed past Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who had earlier denied Lamine Yamal and Alvaro Morata.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm very happy with the goal, but above all in such a close game in which we had to open the scoring," said Real Sociedad midfielder Zubimendi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He doesn't score many but he's starting to so I hope he continues like this," said De la Fuente. "He's one of the best players in the world in his position."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spain moved up to seven points, one above Denmark, with Serbia picking up their first win after beating Switzerland 2-0 in Leskovac.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Serbia led through Nico Elvedi's own goal in first-half stoppage time and Aleksandar Mitrovic doubled the advantage before Predrag Rajkovic saved a penalty from Swiss striker Breel Embolo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both games in Group C3 finished goalless as Bulgaria were held at home by Luxembourg and Northern Ireland drew against Belarus on neutral ground in Hungary.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Romania eased to a 3-0 win away to Cyprus in Group C2, while Kosovo beat Lithuania 2-1. (AFP)

  <img alt="Belarus's Aryna Sabalenka celebrates after her victory against USA's Coco Gauff during their women’s semi-final match at the Wuhan Open tennis tournament in Wuhan, China. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774228_1_20241012194045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the Wuhan Open final for the third time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A champion in Wuhan in 2018 and 2019, Sabalenka improved her perfect record in the tournament to 16-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff, who was on a nine-match winning streak on the back of her title run in Beijing last week, played a perfect first set but committed a whopping 21 double-faults during a semi-final lasting two hours, 26 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has now won 19 of her last 20 matches, a stretch that includes titles in Cincinnati and at the US Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The atmosphere was incredible," said Sabalenka, who was 2-4 down in the second set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It definitely felt like one of the biggest matches of my career because the crowd made it feel like it was a Grand Slam final."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka struggled on serve early on and couldn't control her forehand as a clinical Gauff leapt to a double-break 5-0 lead inside 19 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The American dropped a mere two points behind her first serve and limited the Belarusian to just two winners throughout that opening frame.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the first set was a rout, the second was a dogfight with six of the first eight games going against serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After 78 minutes of play, Sabalenka found herself in the lead for the first time in the match, inching ahead 5-4 to up the pressure on Gauff, whose serve abandoned her when she needed it most.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Gauff's double-fault count rising, Sabalenka took full advantage and broke serve to level the contest and force a decider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A marathon third game that witnessed seven deuces and three break points saw Sabalenka win a seventh consecutive game and hold for a 3-0 lead in the final set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite Gauff's best retaliatory efforts to level for 4-4 Sabalenka held on to close out a gritty victory. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner reached the final of the Shanghai Masters after convincingly defeating the Czech Republic's Tomas Machac 6-4, 7-5 on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner will take on Novak Djokovic in the final, who fought through a knee problem to defeat Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) in an "incredible fight" on Saturday, setting up a blockbuster Shanghai Masters showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33rd-ranked Machac was looking to repeat his giant-slaying of Thursday, when he knocked out world number two Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The semi-final got off to an electric start when the Czech broke Sinner in the first game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the two-time Grand Slam champion kept his cool to break back in the fourth, then claimed the tenth game to clinch the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second set neither was able to break serve until the 12th game, when the Italian hit a winner to book his place in Sunday's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough... he is playing with so much confidence and he can hit a ball really hard, and is serving very well," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I tried to stay there mentally... I'm very happy about how I'm fighting at the moment." (AFP)

  <img alt="Serbia’s Novak Djokovic celebrates winning against Czech Republic’s Jakub Mensik during their match at the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774140_1_20241011213250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Novak Djokovic proved his staying power on Friday, beating an opponent 18 years his junior 6-7 (4/7), 6-1, 6-4 to claim the last spot in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37-year-old's victory over the Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik came a day after one of his greatest rivals and contemporaries, Rafael Nadal, announced he would retire in November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Serb, who is aiming for a 100th singles title in Shanghai, will next face world number seven Taylor Fritz after the American beat Belgium's David Goffin 6-3, 6-4 earlier on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall, big battle, it took the best out of me to win it," said Djokovic after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both Djokovic and 65th-ranked Mensik brought serious firepower to the court, their hard-hitting rallies driving the stadium wild with tension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first set was closely fought, with Djokovic's break in the ninth game matched immediately by Mensik in the next.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The veteran pulled ahead early in the tiebreak, but seemed to lose focus, allowing the 19-year-old to come from behind to win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 24-time Grand Slam champion dominated the second set though, breaking in the second and sixth game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mensik recovered to pile on the pressure again in the third, but Djokovic got a crucial break in the fifth game to be crowned winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Djokovic called his opponent "one of the best players we have on the tour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's only 19 and he's already playing at such a high level, managing situations of high pressure so well for someone who doesn't have much experience," he said. "I think the future is very bright for him." (AFP)

    Guardians down Tigers to stay alive in MLB playoffs

  <img alt="David Fry smashes a 97 mph fastball from Beau Brieske over the left center-field fence. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774068_1_20241011100522.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   David Fry blasted the go-ahead two-run home run and the Cleveland Guardians held on for a 5-4 victory over Detroit on Thursday to force a decisive game five in their Major League Baseball playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Guardians levelled the best-of-five American League division series at two games apiece and will host the deciding game on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland, shut out by the upstart Tigers in games two and three, were down 3-2 when Fry was called in to pinch hit with one runner on and two out in the top of the seventh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He deposited a 97 mph fastball from Tigers reliever Beau Brieske over the left center-field fence to put the Guardians ahead for good.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I was just trying to get a pitch to hit," Fry said. "I had some opportunities yesterday to drive some runners in and didn't get the job done. So I was looking to get it done for the boys and luckily it went out."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland added a run in the top of the ninth, Fry laying down a bunt that allowed Brayan Rocchio to score from third base. Rocchio had singled with one out in the inning and reached third on Steven Kwan's base hit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Luckily it worked," Fry said of the bunt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That insurance run proved necessary when the Tigers clawed one back in the bottom of the ninth. Justyn-Henry Malloy opened the inning off Cleveland closing pitcher Emmanuel Clase with a double to left field. He reached third on a ground out by Parker Meadows and scored on another ground ball by Jace Jung before Clase recorded the final out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland ended a streak of 11 defeats in playoff elimination games, a skid dating back to game six of the 1997 World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jose Ramirez also homered for the Guardians and Zach McKinstry homered for Detroit in a tense battle that twice saw the Tigers rally to tie it before they took a 3-2 on Wenceel Perez's run-scoring single in the sixth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The winner of the series will face either the New York Yankees or Kansas City Royals for a place in the World Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees took a 2-1 series lead into game four in Kansas City on Thursday, hoping pitching ace Gerrit Cole can recover from a lacklustre performance in a game one loss and still waiting for slugger Aaron Judge to come alive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Judge, who led the major leagues with 58 home runs in the regular season, is 1-for-11 at the plate in the first three games of the series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Giancarlo Stanton was the hero of the 3-2 game-three win that put the Yankees on the cusp of advancing, belting a go-ahead solo homer in the eighth inning as part of a three-hit night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stanton was confident that Judge would break out of the doldrums.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's definitely going to do damage," Stanton said. "It's only a matter of time. He's had good at-bats, so, yeah, it'll come when we need him most." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   A 94th-minute winner by Vangelis Pavlidis gave Greece a 2-1 victory on Thursday against England in a Nations League clash overshadowed by the death of Greek player George Baldock on the eve of the game, while Italy were held to a draw by Belgium.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greek striker Pavlidis netted a brace, either side of a late Jude Bellingham goal, to send Greece top of Group B2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Greece's first-ever victory against England came in an emotionally-charged evening at Wembley, which started with a minute's silence prior to kick-off for Baldock, an English-born Greece international who drowned in his swimming pool in Athens on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a really special day for us because of George. We are people and it's a special night because of him," Pavlidis told ITV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A difficult moment for us because George was part of the team. Special guy. We have to play for him and it doesn't matter the score today. We gave everything for him."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Greeks took a deserved lead in the 49th minute when Pavlidis danced through flimsy defending in the England box, before driving the ball past Jordan Pickford.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visitors had three disallowed goals in the match – the last of which came just minutes before Real Madrid's Bellingham hammered in an 87th-minute equaliser for England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, Greece were not to be denied a third win in three Nations League matches as England failed to clear the danger in their area and Pavlidis took full advantage and drilled home a late winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Group A2, Italy and Belgium played out an eventful 2-2 draw in Rome.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Italians raced into the lead inside 60 seconds when Andrea Cambiaso got his first international goal by bundling home from close range.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mateo Retegui doubled the hosts' lead on 24 minutes, sweeping home with his left foot after a spilled save.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy looked comfortable and were dominating the encounter until they suffered a double blow inside the final 10 minutes of the first half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lorenzo Pellegrini initially picked up a yellow card for his late lunge on Arthur Theate in the 38th minute but, after a VAR review, the Italy playmaker was instead shown a straight red.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Belgium then duly halved the deficit from the resulting free-kick, with Maxim De Cuyper finishing emphatically from 25 yards following a clever set-piece move.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal forward Leandro Trossard completed the Belgian comeback on 61 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A deep corner was nodded back across goal and Trossard ghosted past the static defence to prod the ball past Gianluigi Donnarumma from close range.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are episodes that can change a game, like their goal immediately after we went down to ten men," said Italy coach Luciano Spalletti.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A result doesn't always depend on the football you play and your tactics. Certainly, we could have played better in the second half after a very good first half."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Italy remain top of their group with France sitting second after they beat Israel 4-1 in Budapest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eduardo Camavinga gave France a seventh-minute lead when the goalkeeper fumbled his tame effort, allowing the ball to bounce over the line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Omri Gandelman levelled on 24 minutes, before Christopher Nkunku restored France's advantage four minutes later with a sharp finish.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As the clock wound down, the visitors added two more goals to their tally via Matteo Guendouzi and Bradley Barcola.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Erling Haaland scored a brace as Norway eased past Slovenia 3-0 in Oslo to sit top of Group B3, three points ahead of Austria who beat Kazakhstan 4-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Republic of Ireland came from behind in Helsinki to beat Finland 2-1, they sit third in Group B2 behind England.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Friday, Germany visit Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary host the Netherlands in Group A3, while Iceland take on Wales in Group B4. (AFP)

    Rafael Nadal to retire from tennis

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Rafael Nadal announced on Thursday he would retire from tennis at age 38 following next month's Davis Cup finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal won 22 Grand Slam singles titles during an unprecedented era in the 2000s and 2010s that he shared with his rivals in the so-called Big Three, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Really, everything I have experienced has been a dream come true," Nadal said in an announcement on social media. "I leave with the absolute peace of mind of having given my best, of having made an effort in every way.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Spaniard indicated his decision was related to persistent injury problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially. I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations. It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life, everything has a beginning and an end,” Nadal said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal’s unrelenting, physical style of play — every point pursued as though it were his last, sprinting and sliding into place for that high-bouncing bullwhip of a lefty forehand — made him one of the greats of the game and the unquestioned King of Clay, the slow, red surface on which he claimed his record 14 French Open championships.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That’s more than anyone, man or woman, won at any one of the sport’s four major tournaments, a dominance celebrated by a statue of Nadal that stands near the main entrance to the grounds of Roland Garros and in the shadow of its main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal added he was excited to finish his career at the Davis Cup, which will be played in Malaga, Spain.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I am very excited that my last tournament will be the final of the Davis Cup and representing my country," he said. "I think I’ve come full circle since one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Seville in 2004.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Nadal has not played since the Paris Olympics, where he lost to old rival Djokovic in the second round of the singles tournament and reached the quarterfinals of the men’s doubles with Carlos Alcaraz.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I think it is the appropriate time to put an end to a career that has been long and much more successful than I could have ever imagined," he said. (AP)

   England's Harry Brook hit his maiden triple century on the fourth day of the opening Test against Pakistan in Multan on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 25-year-old clubbed a four off spinner Saim Ayub to become the sixth Englishman to score 300 or more in Test cricket, achieving the feat off 310 balls, with 28 fours and three sixes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England declared their first innings at a mammoth 823-7 before tea for a lead of 267 runs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook notched up a superb 317 and Joe Root hit 262 as both batsmen made their highest test scores on the flat wicket at the Multan Cricket Stadium. (Agencies)

    Lindor powers Mets past Phillies into NL Championship

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Francisco Lindor hit the go-ahead grand slam in the sixth inning Wednesday for the Mets, who beat the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 to win their National League Division Series three games to one.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lindor's homer was just the latest dramatic moment for the surging Mets, who will face either the Los Angeles Dodgers or San Diego Padres in the NL Championship Series beginning Sunday on the road in a best-of-seven series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Edwin Díaz struck out Kyle Schwarber with two runners aboard to end it as New York finished off the rival Phillies in Game 4 of their best-of-five Division Series, winning 3-1 to wrap up a postseason series at home for the first time in 24 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “I want to win it all – and ours will be a team that will forever be remembered,” Lindor said, speaking in the interview room with one of his young daughters on his lap drinking from a Gatorade bottle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This will be a team that comes every 10 years and eats for free everywhere they go – and I want to do that. But the job is not done."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets opened the season 0-5, were 11 games under .500 in early June and didn't clinch the NL's sixth seed until September 30.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The season-ending loss represents the latest October disappointment for the NL East-winning Phillies, who reached the World Series as the No. 6 seed in 2022 but lost in the NLCS last year before being eliminated in their first playoff series this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Mookie Betts homered for the second straight night, Shohei Ohtani hit an RBI single and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 8-0 Wednesday night to force a deciding Game 5 in their tense NL Division Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Will Smith and Gavin Lux each hit a two-run homer for the Dodgers, who snapped a two-game losing streak and now return home for the next matchup between the NL West rivals on Friday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Padres won 10-2 at Dodger Stadium in Game 2 on Sunday night, when tempers flared on the field and in the stands .
   <br/>

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City made a spectacular return to the Uefa Women's Champions League on Wednesday, defeating holders Barcelona 2-0 in the opening round of group stage matches as Bayern Munich downed Arsenal 5-2.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both teams hit the woodwork in a lively start to the Group D clash at a sold-out Joie Stadium in Manchester, with City grabbing the lead when defender Naomi Layzell bravely scrambled home.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vivianne Miedema headed smartly back across goal from a corner and a lunging Layzell reacted quickest to prod the ball past a crowd of Barcelona players.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year's Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati went close to an equaliser with a deflected effort, but Khadija Shaw grabbed a second for City to condemn Barcelona to a rare defeat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It's fantastic from Naomi and Shaw finishes it off. It gave the players a real lift and we have to remember who we're playing against. It's a step for us," City manager Gareth Taylor said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City are making their first group stage appearance, having last played in the Champions League proper in 2021 when Barcelona knocked them out in the quarter-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The defeat is only Barcelona's second in 19 games in the group stage since its introduction for the 2021-22 season. It is also the first time they have failed to score a goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Pernille Harder scored a second-half hat-trick as Bayern kicked off their Group C campaign with a convincing victory over Arsenal in Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal led through Mariona Caldentey's strike in Germany, but Bayern captain Glodis Viggosdottir brought the home side level before Sydney Lohmann put them ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Laia Codina equalised for Arsenal midway through the second half only for Harder to find the net three times in the final 20 minutes to secure an impressive win for German champions Bayern.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The last few years have been tough with injuries, so now I'm just happy to be back playing in the Champions League. I was happy with the goals and the win," said Harder, who ended a two-year goal drought in the competition. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Joe Root went past Alastair Cook as England's highest Test run scorer with an unconquered hundred against Pakistan, anchoring his team to 492-3 in the first Test in Multan on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33-year-old overhauled Cook's aggregate of 12,472 runs and became the fifth-highest scorer of all time after he drove seamer Aamer Jamal for a straight boundary to reach 71 just before lunch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root was still batting on 176 at the close on day three with his partner Harry Brook on 141 not out, taking England within 64 runs of Pakistan's first innings total of 556.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pair added 243 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket, rebuffing Pakistan's bowling attack on a lifeless pitch that had punished England's bowlers on the first two days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm obviously proud but I still feel there's plenty more left to do and many more runs to get," said Root.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I always think your best hundred is your next one," he said. "You've got to keep staying hungry and willing to find ways of contributing, ways of getting better."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm sure I'll be looking back on it at some point when I'm finished and be very proud of it," Root added. "But we've still got an opportunity to go and win this game which is exciting."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's head coach Jason Gillespie said his team needed early wickets on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We suspected the way England will look to get a lead and have a crack at us," he told reporters. "We have to come out in the morning and hit the ground running."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root's memorable 481-minute knock included 12 boundaries. Brook amassed the same number and added a six despite suffering cramps.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brook reached his sixth hundred with a single off part-timer Saud Shakeel from 118 balls, adding to his previous three in England's 3-0 series rout of Pakistan two years ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Root added 136 for the third wicket with Ben Duckett, who made a robust 84 and showed no effect from a thumb dislocation on Tuesday that forced him to bat at number four.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Duckett was the only man dismissed in the second session, trapped leg-before by Jamal after hitting 11 boundaries. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has a new role as head of football operations at Red Bull, which owns the Leipzig, Salzburg and New York clubs, the company said Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "After nearly 25 years on the sidelines, I couldn't be more excited to be involved in a project like this," said Klopp, who left Liverpool at the end of last season after nine years in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 57-year-old will start his tenure on January 1, 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I still love football and I still love working and Red Bull gives me the perfect platform for that," Klopp said in a video on Instagram.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I want to share my experience," he added. "I want to learn again, because when you are in the job and play every three days you barely have time for that – and now I have time. I want to see, feel, figure out what is useful for football."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to a statement released by the Austrian energy drinks brand on Wednesday, "Klopp will not interfere in the day-to-day business of the clubs, but rather take on a higher-level strategic position."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I couldn't be more excited," Klopp said, adding "I see my role primarily as a mentor for the coaches and management of the Red Bull clubs."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sky Germany reports Klopp's contract includes an exit clause which allows him to take over as manager of the German national side should be approached.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner will face Daniil Medvedev in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals after both had straight-set victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner put some old demons to rest in overcoming American Ben Shelton 6-4, 7-6 (7/1), while Medvedev took out Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shelton, ranked 16, knocked Sinner out at the same stage last year, but on Wednesday the Italian looked confident from the start as he won in 88 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Open champion pulled ahead in the ninth game of the first set, breaking when Shelton hit long, then dominated the second set tiebreak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough, you don't have so much control when you play against him... I just tried to stay strong mentally," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number five Medvedev and Tsitsipas were meeting for the 14th time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Greek started the second set strongly, breaking in the first game, but Medvedev broke in the fourth and eighth to progress.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev and Sinner have met four times this year already in the final stages of tournaments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner beat Medvedev in the semi-finals at Miami, the quarter-finals at the US Open and in the Australian Open final, but the Russian ended the Italian's hopes in the last eight at Wimbledon in an epic five-set battle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm gonna bring the fight," said Medvedev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I could have done much better in the US Open... I didn't explore enough my potential during this match. So I'm going to try to explore this potential tomorrow," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also through to the quarterfinals is world number two Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in the China Open final a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old was facing off against veteran Gael Monfils, winning 6-4, 7-5 for a 12th straight victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Frenchman had upset Alcaraz at their last meeting in August at Cincinnati, and the Spaniard admitted that "was on his mind" during the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really, really happy I won the match, and that I stayed calm through the whole match," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Playing against Gael is never easy... You need to be focused on every ball," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in action on Wednesday are four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic and world number three Alexander Zverev. (AFP)

    Ex-Barcelona star Iniesta retires aged 40

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta, who won two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup with an all-conquering Spain team, announced his retirement from football on Tuesday at the age of 40.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Being on the pitch is over," a visibly emotional Iniesta told reporters at a news conference in Barcelona while reflecting on a professional career that began with the Catalan giants in 2002.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I can't stay away from football, it's my life and will continue to be my life. Now I need to continue educating myself, I'm in the process of doing my coaching diploma and that's the next step."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will try to come back and do a great job. However it won't be running after the ball, but from another place," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iniesta came up through Barcelona's famed La Masia academy and made his first-team debut aged just 18, becoming a mainstay in the midfield before his departure 16 years later after 674 appearances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He won nine La Liga titles and the Champions League four times with Barcelona, also lifting six Copas del Rey in a haul of 32 trophies during his time at Camp Nou.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iniesta formed a devastating midfield with Xavi Hernandez and Sergio Busquets, becoming the standard-bearers of the "tiki-taka" style of football that catapulted both club and country to new heights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He played alongside the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Samuel Eto'o and Luis Suarez for Barcelona, who captured the treble in 2009 under Pep Guardiola and again six years later with Luis Enrique in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Messi paid tribute to Iniesta on social media and called him "one of the most magical team-mates", while Spain coach Luis de la Fuente said he had given "society an example of what a professional athlete is".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   His greatest moment came in the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg when he scored the winning goal for Spain against the Netherlands in extra time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He won 131 caps for Spain before calling time on his international career after the 2018 World Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After leaving Barcelona in 2018, Iniesta spent five years with Japanese club Vissel Kobe before playing one final season with Emirates of the UAE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'd like to return to Barca at some point. Not just to say it, but because those who had so much influence, in one way or another, have to be there," said Iniesta.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "When I can do what I did as a player in another role at the club. I'd be delighted," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Barcelona praised the retiring Iniesta in a post on the club's X account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Iniesta, your football will live on forever." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chelsea began their hunt for Women's Champions League glory with a 3-2 win over Real Madrid on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sjoeke Nuesken and Guro Reiten gave Chelsea the lead before Alba Redondo pulled one back for the visitors before half-time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mayra Ramirez struck in the second half to restore Chelsea's two-goal advantage. A late Linda Caicedo tap-in set up a nervy finale at Stamford Bridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Football is about winning games and today we won even though we weren't at our best. We are going to work from here," player-of-the-match Johanna Rytting Kaneryd told Uefa's website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chelsea went into the lead in the second minute when Rytting Kaneryd's cross struck the unfortunate Sheila Garcia, via the head of Nuesken, and trickled into the Madrid net.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The English champions doubled their lead shortly before the half-hour as the referee pointed to the spot after Maria Mendez caught Nuesken as the pair fought over a loose ball in the box.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reiten slotted the spot-kick beyond the reach of Misa Rodriguez, who had correctly guessed which way to dive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Madrid halved the deficit on 39 minutes. Fine wing play by Olga Carmona created the chance and after some pinball in the Chelsea box, Redondo showed composure to take a touch and finish from 10 yards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ramirez restored the hosts' two-goal lead eight minutes into the second half with a header that looped over goalkeeper Misa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Caicedo converted from close range in the 84th minute after Lucy Bronze had blocked a goal-bound effort on the line, however the Spaniards were unable to complete the comeback as Chelsea ground out the win. (AFP)

   Kareem Hunt and Xavier Worthy rushed for touchdowns, Harrison Butker kicked four field goals, Patrick Mahomes passed for 331 yards and the host Kansas City Chiefs defeated the New Orleans Saints 26-13 on Monday night to improve their undefeated record to 5-0 on the season.
   <br/>

   JuJu Smith-Schuster caught seven passes for 130 yards and Travis Kelce made nine receptions for 70 yards to help the Chiefs overcome the absence of injured wide receivers Hollywood Brown and Rashee Rice.

    Partial victory for Man City in Premier League dispute

  <img alt="City claimed a partial victory over the Premier League after an arbitration panel ruled on sponsorship deals. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773606_1_20241008084426.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Manchester City claimed a partial victory over the Premier League on Monday after an arbitration panel ruled on sponsorship deals, known as Associated Party Transactions (APT), that the Abu Dhabi-owned club was blocked from completing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League put its own spin on what some commentators saw as a landmark verdict, saying the panel's redacted 175-page document endorsed the overall objectives and decision-making of the APT system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The panel found parts of the league's APT rules broke British competition law, however, and were also unlawful because clubs were unable to comment on types of data the league would take into account.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League's decision in relation to two City transactions in 2023, with First Abu Dhabi Bank and Etihad Aviation group, were "reached in a procedurally unfair manner" and must be overturned, the panel ruled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   APT rules were designed to maintain the Premier League's competitiveness by preventing clubs from inflating the value of sponsorship deals with companies linked to their owners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City said in a statement it had succeeded with their claim and the Premier League was found, among other things, to have abused its dominant position.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Tribunal has determined both that the rules are structurally unfair and that the Premier League was specifically unfair in how it applied those rules to the Club in practice," City added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The rules were found to be discriminatory in how they operate, because they deliberately excluded shareholder loans," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League said the majority of City's challenges had been rejected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moreover, the Tribunal found that the rules are necessary in order for the League’s financial controls to be effective," it added in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reigning champions City are also involved in a separate independent hearing into the club's alleged breaches of Premier League financial regulations which began in September, with a verdict expected some time before the end of the current season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The club have won eight Premier League titles, the Champions League, three FA Cups, six League Cups, the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup since being bought by Sheikh Mansour's Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League introduced a temporary ban on clubs being sponsored by firms linked to their owners following the sale of Newcastle United to a consortium dominated by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in 2021. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Kerry Carpenter hit a three-run homer off Cleveland's All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase in the ninth inning, and the Detroit Tigers stunned the Guardians 3-0 in Game 2 on Monday to even their AL Division Series at one game apiece.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Carpenter connected for a 423-foot shot with two outs off Clase, who had not given up a run since Aug. 30 and led the American League with 47 saves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “To do it off him is special,” said Carpenter. “He's one of the best.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Detroit ace Tarik Skubal pitched seven shutout innings, increasing his postseason total to 13, before the Tigers put together a rare big inning against the almost unhittable Clase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The intimidating right-hander has dominated hitters all season – he hasn't blown a save since May – and was making just his second multi-inning appearance of 2024.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jake Rogers and Trey Sweeney hit consecutive two-out singles. Carpenter, who entered an inning earlier as a pinch-hitter, turned on Clase's third straight slider, sending the ball into the right-field seats and shocking Cleveland's rowdy home crowd.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “How about those three two-out hits?” Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardians manager Stephen Vogt didn't regret using Clase for more than one inning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Emmanuel has been locked down all year. He’s been nearly perfect – he’s human, too," Vogt said. "These things are going to happen, and it’s unfortunate the timing of when it did, but at the same time he’s going to have the ball in the ninth again.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “This is the best closer in the game for a reason, and they just happened to get him tonight.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The homer drove in the first runs of the series for the Tigers, who have been finding ways to win for months. Detroit went 31-13 after August 11 to qualify for the postseason, and stunned the AL West champion Houston Astros in the Wild Card Series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They're at it again and head home to Comerica Park for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Thursday with a chance to advance. (AP)

    Juventus and Pogba to part ways after doping ban cut

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Paul Pogba's doping suspension was cut from four years to 18 months after experts supported the French international's claims of having unintentionally ingested a banned substance, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The France international was provisionally suspended by Italy's national anti-doping organisation (NADO Italia) in September 2023 after testing positive for DHEA – a banned substance that raises levels of testosterone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   CAS reduced the sentence last week, with Pogba saying his "nightmare is over". The 31-year-old, who has a contract with Italy's Juventus until June 2026, will be eligible to return to football in March.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, CAS said Pogba had argued that his ingestion of DHEA was not intentional and had occurred after he consumed a supplement prescribed to him by a medical doctor in Florida.

   "Mr. Pogba had been given assurances that the medical doctor, who had claimed to treat several high level US and international athletes, was knowledgeable and would be mindful of Mr. Pogba's anti-doping obligations under the World Anti-Doping Code," CAS added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Mr. Pogba's case was supported by several experts. Much of the evidence provided by Mr. Pogba was unopposed," it wrote. "The CAS Panel determined, however, that Mr. Pogba was not without fault and that, as a professional football player, he should have paid a greater care in the circumstances."

  <div class="itemFullText">
   An apprentice jockey from Hong Kong has been injured in a fall during a race in Australia, the Hong Kong Jockey Club said on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ivy Lam is said to be in stable condition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She fell after her horse suffered a heart attack during a race at Gawler Racecourse in Adelaide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Ivy was injured when her mount, Jacob’s Gate, suffered a medical episode and collapsed at the 700-metre mark. Racing SA stewards and First Care Medical staff were immediately on the scene and worked to stabilise her condition prior to the arrival of SA Ambulance paramedics,” a statement issued by the local horse racing governing body, Racing South Australia, said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lam was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for treatment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong Jockey Club said Amy Chan, headmistress of the Apprentice Jockeys’ School, was heading to Australia to offer assistance to Lam and her family.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   LeBron James and eldest son Bronny James claimed a piece of NBA history on Sunday after making their long-awaited first appearance alongside each other for the Los Angeles Lakers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The duo appeared together at the start of the second quarter in the Lakers' pre-season game against the Phoenix Suns in Palm Desert, east of Los Angeles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anticipation about when the James duo would make their first appearance together has built since the Lakers picked Bronny with the 55th pick in the NBA Draft in June.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   New Lakers coach J.J. Redick, who said last month that the two would play together "sooner rather than later," said in pre-game remarks on Sunday that the prospect of the James' lining up alongside one another was "surreal."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm excited about it," Redick said. "I am very honored that I get to be a part of history. It's going to happen in the flow of the game."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the event, Redick introduced Bronny James to the floor with the Lakers leading 34-25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   LeBron James has said that the prospect of playing with Bronny on the same team had given him a new lease on life as he enters the 22nd season of a glittering career.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's a lot of excitement, a pure joy, to be able to come to work every day, put in hard work with your son every day and be able to see him continue to grow," James said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We push each other. He pushes me. I push him. We push our teammates, and vice versa. So it's just a very joyous moment not only for myself, but for our family. So it's pretty awesome. Gives you a lot of life."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bronny meanwhile said on Monday he was fueled by the words of critics who have suggested he owes his place on the Lakers roster entirely to his superstar father.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just taking all that stuff, that criticism and backlash that people have given me and turning it into something that can fuel me," Bronny James said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lakers coach Redick has insisted that Bronny James was drafted by the franchise on merit, pushing back at suggestions that the former University of Southern California player had been "given" a roster spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Bronny has earned this through hard work," Redick said earlier this year. "He's going to have a great opportunity to become an excellent NBA player." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Top seed Jannik Sinner and third-seeded Carlos Alcaraz cruised into to the fourth round of the Rolex Shanghai Masters on Sunday in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number one Sinner overcame a late challenge from Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry to reach the round of 16, while Spain's Carlos Alcaraz bested Wu Yibing in straight sets to knock out a home-country favorite.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, fifth-seeded Daniil Medvedev survived an opening-set loss against Italy's Matteo Arnaldi to advance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   23-year-old Sinner dropped a first-set tiebreaker to Argentina's Tomas Etcheverry but rebounded to win 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2. Etcheverry presented a stiff challenge late in the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the world number one serving at 4-2, Etcheverry had three break points but couldn't convert, and Sinner went on to break service in the next game to cruise to the win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the match, the Italian knew he had dodged trouble.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a very tough match, physically mentally, so I am very happy to get through this one," said Sinner. "I felt like it was a tough set that I lost. I had my chances to win the set, but these things can happen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes you have to wait for your chances, which I have done, trying to stay calm mentally," he added. "And today that was the key."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner is seeking a seventh tournament title in 2024. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The unbeaten Minnesota Vikings, the surprise package of the NFL season, held on for a fifth straight win with a nail-biting 23-17 victory over the New York Jets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, who was drafted by the Jets and then released after three seasons, was well contained by the Jets defense but crucially Minnesota were able to stop Aaron Rodgers at the death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodgers led a 10-play drive as New York searched for a touchdown to win the contest but on 3rd & 10, the Jets quarterback's attempted pass to Mike Williams was picked off by Stephon Gilmore.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It didn't look like being a close contest after the Vikings had opened up a 17-0 lead in the second quarter after they followed up a field goal with a 63-yard interception return from Andrew Van Ginkel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   C.J. Ham then ran in from two yards but the Jets gave themselves some hope with Rodgers moving out of the pocket and finding Allen Lazard at the back of the end-zone to make it 17-7 at the half.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Jets trailed 20-10 midway through the fourth quarter before Rodgers found Garrett Wilson with a one-yard pass and when the Vikings could only manage a field goal in response, the outcome was in Rodgers' hands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the former Green Bay quarterback, who finished with 244 passing yards and two touchdowns, gave up his third interception of the game to leave the Jets on 2-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers suffered their third defeat of the campaign with a surprise 24-23 loss to NFC West rivals the Arizona Cardinals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 49ers, beaten in the Super Bowl by the Kansas City Chiefs last season, led 23-10 at half-time but Kyler Murray found Elijah Higgins with a two-yard touchdown pass which was followed by a two-point conversion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 35-yard Chad Ryland field goal put the Cardinals a point up but 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy had the ball with 1:37 remaining only to be intercepted by Kyzir White, ending the contest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elsewhere, the Washington Commanders moved to 4-1 on the season, for the first time since 2008, after a 34-13 win over the struggling Cleveland Browns.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington's rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels threw a 41-yard touchdown to Dyami Brown just before half-time to send the Commanders in with a 24-3 lead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bryan Robinson Jr. had two rushing touchdowns for the Commanders on what was another miserable day for Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson. (AFP)

  <img alt="United boss Erik ten Hag's job remains in jeopardy after the goalless draw at Villa Park. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773464_1_20241007015651.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Erik ten Hag insisted he retains the support of Manchester United's hierarchy after his troubled side were held to a 0-0 draw against Aston Villa, while Tottenham blew a two-goal lead in a stunning 3-2 defeat at Brighton on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag is fighting to avoid the sack after United's dismal start to the Premier League season, but their latest spluttering display did little to suggest he can turn the tide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United captain Bruno Fernandes smashed a second half free-kick off the bar, but the visitors needed a Diogo Dalot block on Jaden Philogene's shot to avoid a damaging defeat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After finishing eighth last season – their worst final position since 1990 – United are languishing in 14th place so far in this campaign with only two wins in their first seven league games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten Hag's team have gone five games without a win in all competitions since beating third-tier Barnsley in the League Cup.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe refused to guarantee Ten Hag's position on Friday, admitting the club is not where he wants them to be.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The British billionaire, who watched from the stands at Villa Park alongside his coterie of advisors and former boss Alex Ferguson, will hardly have been reassured that the Dutchman is the right choice to lift United out of their malaise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Ten Hag remains confident he will be given time to turn the tide after winning the FA Cup last season and the League Cup in his debut campaign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We always speak, we speak every week. We are all onboard together, on one page," Ten Hag said when asked if he was planning to speak to Ratcliffe and company.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We know where we are working to, it's a long-term project and we have to keep improving the process.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We have proved in two very tough away games this is a team and you show the togetherness and the spirit, but also the belief and the faith they have."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the Amex Stadium, Brennan Johnson put Tottenham in front after 25 minutes with a clinical strike from Dominic Solanke's pass. It was the Wales forward's sixth goal in his last six appearances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   James Maddison doubled Tottenham's lead in the 37th minute as the midfielder's shot eluded Bart Verbruggen's weak attempted save.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Yankuba Minteh reduced the deficit with a close-range blast after Destiny Udogie's woeful clearance in the 48th minute
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Georginio Rutter eluded three Tottenham defenders to convert Kaoru Mitoma's 58th minute pass with a composed finish from 12 yards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And Tottenham's meltdown was complete eight minutes later when Danny Welbeck was left unmarked to head home from Rutter's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tottenham's third defeat in seven league games raised renewed questions about boss Ange Postecoglou's refusal to adapt his attacking philosophy after their defensive flaws were brutally exposed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Noni Madueke's equaliser rescued Chelsea in a 1-1 draw against 10-man Nottingham Forest that ended the Blues' five-match winning run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enzo Maresca's side fell behind to Chris Wood's strike early in the second half at Stamford Bridge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   England winger Madueke hauled Chelsea level but the hosts couldn't find a winner despite their numerical advantage in the closing stages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Forest had to play the last 12 minutes with 10 men after James Ward-Prowse was sent off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chelsea had won their previous three league games – and five in all competitions – to raise hopes that Maresca could be the man to lift the west Londoners out of their long malaise.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Being held by Forest was a setback but Chelsea still go into the international break in fourth place in the Premier League. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Bluestocking rewarded her trainer Ralph Beckett for supplementing her this week by winning Europe's most prestigious race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on Sunday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The English runner ridden by Irishman Rossa Ryan came home clear of French filly Aventure with Irish runner Los Angeles third.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Arc de Triomphe connoisseurs the winning colours are very familiar as it is a record seventh time they have been welcomed back to the winners enclosure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah may have died but his family have kept the flame burning.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For 53-year-old Beckett, though, it is a first Arc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "She's extraordinary, good horses train themselves," said Beckett, whose cousin Teddy is the former racing manager to the Abdullah's Juddmonte racing operation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For Ryan too it is the first taste of what it is like to win an Arc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's very surreal to be honest with you – my family are here too," Ryan, riding in only his second Arc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Japan's hopes of winning the race they desire above all others ended in further disappointment as hotly fancied Shin Emperor finished unplaced.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was an unpleasant incident in the middle of the race as outsider Haya Zark suddenly fell back through the 16 runner field and pulled up after seriously hampering Mqse De Sevigne. (AFP)

   After a disappointing few months by her standards, including surrendering her New York crown in the last 16, Gauff adds the China Open to her triumph in Auckland in January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sixth-ranked Gauff, under a new coaching team in the Chinese capital after splitting with Brad Gilbert last month, wiped away tears at the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It proved one match too far for Muchova, who at 49 in the world was the lowest-ranked finalist in the history of the prestigious WTA 1000 tournament.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff made a fast start, breaking the Czech for a 2-0 lead in the first set and then holding her own serve without conceding a point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The young American was up 3-0 with barely 10 minutes on the clock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 28-year-old Muchova sent down an ace to get on the board but Gauff was in the mood and her serve – her biggest problem of late – was firing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff had three break points in the sixth game and converted the first to streak to a 5-1 lead against a shell-shocked Muchova.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff rattled off her third ace of the match to give her two set points.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Her serving wobbles momentarily returned but she wrapped the first set up in 29 minutes on her third set point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Muchova, chasing only the second title of her career, dumped out top seed Aryna Sabalenka in the quarter-finals and then beat Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last year's French Open finalist found her feet at the start of the second set and broke for a 2-0 lead, only for Gauff to break back immediately on the way to a comfortable win. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cleveland's Lane Thomas crushed a three-run home run as part of a historic five-run first inning and the Guardians powered to a 7-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers to open their Major League Baseball second-round playoff series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thomas belted the first pitch from Detroit reliever Reese Olson over the left field wall to put the Guardians up 5-0 without an out in the first on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cleveland had already roughed up Tigers starting pitcher Tyler Holton, putting their first four batters on base before Holton was pulled without recording an out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Steven Kwan smacked a leadoff double off the top of the right field wall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   David Fry drew a walk and Jose Ramirez hit a ground ball that went through the legs of Detroit third baseman Zach McKinstry and allowed Kwan to score.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fry scored on Josh Naylor's single before Olson replaced Holton on the mound, a move that couldn't prevent the Guardians becoming the first American League team to score five runs before recording an out in a playoff game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was awesome," Lane said of homering in his first post-season at-bat. "It started with the guys in front of me, so I think it wouldn't have been possible without those guys."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fry delivered a two-run double off Detroit reliever Ty Madden in the sixth to push Cleveland's lead to 7-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Guardians starting pitcher Tanner Bibee departed to a big ovation in the fifth inning and Cleveland's bullpen kept the Tigers in check the rest of the way to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five AL division series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Later on Saturday, Japanese superstar Shohei Ohtani was poised to make his MLB playoff debut as the Los Angeles Dodgers opened their National League division series against the San Diego Padres.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ohtani won two American League Most Valuable Player awards in six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels but never made it to the post-season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the 30-year-old has shown over and over that he can rise to the big occasion, as evidenced by his six-for-six performance with two home runs in the win over Miami in which Ohtani became the first player to record 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in the same season and helped the Dodges clinch their playoff spot.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked if he was feeling nervous ahead of his playoff debut, Ohtani didn't even need to wait for his usual translation of the question.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Nope," he answered in English before adding through an interpreter: "It's always been my childhood dream to be able to be in an important game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "So I think the excitement of that is greater than anything else I could possibly feel."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The showdown between the NL West division rivals highlights the division matchups, which also include the New York Yankees facing the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets against the Philadelphia Phillies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees and Royals, once fierce playoff rivals, haven't met in the post-season since 1980.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees, driven by an MLB-leading 58 home runs from Aaron Judge, posted the best record in the American League on the way to the AL East title.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the Yankees missed the playoffs in an injury-plagued 2023, former Rookie of the Year and 2022 AL MVP Judge is aiming to add a World Series title to his resume.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Yankees are heavy favourites against a Royals team back in the playoffs one year after losing 106 games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Mets-Phillies series sees an intense NL East rivalry extended to the post-season for the first time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Phillies went 95-67 to lock up the division crown while the Mets battled to the bitter end of the regular season to claim their playoff spot then needed three games to put away the Milwaukee Brewers in the wild card round. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 1-0 to remain top of the Premier League as Arsenal and Manchester City came from behind to win on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   City were 3-2 victors over Fulham to stay one point behind Liverpool, alongside Arsenal who saw off Southampton 3-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arne Slot has now won nine of his first 10 games since succeeding Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool manager, but was frustrated that the visitors invited a late onslaught from the winless Eagles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jota prodded the Reds into the lead from Cody Gakpo's cross on nine minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Portuguese international was then guilty of missing two big chances to extend Liverpool's advantage.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Palace failed to make them pay, but victory came at a cost for Slot as goalkeeper Alisson Becker limped off with a hamstring injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you score the second you break them mentally," said Slot. "All the fans kept believing in a result because it was only 1-0, even though in my opinion we were the dominant team."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fresh from a dominant win over Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Arsenal were expected to sweep aside winless Southampton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the Saints shocked the Emirates 10 minutes into the second half when Cameron Archer fired in his first Premier League goal since a summer move from Aston Villa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lead only lasted three minutes before Kai Havertz scored for the seventh consecutive home game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gabriel Martinelli was introduced after an hour and took just eight minutes to make his mark with a finish on the volley from Bukayo Saka's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Having set up Arsenal's first two goals, Saka pounced on a loose ball to score the third himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He has the capacity to change games, to decide games," said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta on Saka's impact.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If you want to be at the top, sometimes players have to create those moments and he's certainly done that today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodri's season-long absence due to a serious knee injury is expected to be a major blow to City's chances of retaining the title for a fifth consecutive season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it was the Spaniard's deputy Mateo Kovacic who scored twice to turn the game around for the champions at the Etihad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visitors had not lost since the opening night of the season at Manchester United and led thanks to Andreas Pereira's finish from an outrageous backheel assist by Raul Jimenez.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Sometimes I give credit," said City boss Pep Guardiola. "The first goal – who expected Jimenez to do this incredible touch?"
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kovacic's deflected effort quickly brought City level before a cleaner strike less than two minutes into the second half made it 2-1.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jeremy Doku then smashed into the top corner from outside the box to give City a two-goal cushion, which they needed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Rodrigo Muniz gave Fulham hope on 88 minutes, but City held out for a 17th consecutive win against the Cottagers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   West Ham eased the pressure on new boss Julen Lopetegui by ending a run of three home defeats to start the new season.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Michail Antonio, Mohammed Kudus, Jarrod Bowen and Lucas Paqueta struck for the Hammers in a 4-1 win over Ipswich, who are still waiting for their first Premier League win in 22 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anthony Gordon saw a penalty saved on his return to Goodison Park as Newcastle were held 0-0 at Everton.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were six goals before half-time as Brentford beat Wolves 5-3 to leave the visitors still rooted to the foot of the table.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leicester secured their first league win of the season as Facundo Buonanotte's strike beat Bournemouth 1-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag faces a huge match if he is to remain in charge when the Red Devils visit Aston Villa in the pick of Sunday's action. (AFP)

  <img alt="Diogo Jota gets the only goal as Liverpool go four points clear at the summit. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773377_1_20241005215207.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Liverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points thanks to Diogo Jota's winner in a 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arne Slot has now won nine of his first 10 games since succeeding Jurgen Klopp, but will be frustrated that the visitors invited a late onslaught from the winless Eagles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Victory also came at a cost for Liverpool as goalkeeper Alisson Becker limped off in the closing stages ahead of a much more testing run of fixtures after the international break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Defeat leaves Palace still in the bottom three with just three points from their opening seven games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot's seamless start to succeeding saw him become the first Liverpool manager to win eight of his first nine games after beating Bologna 2-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the Dutchman has been quick to point out that tougher tests lie ahead of his side's Premier League title credentials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool face Chelsea, Arsenal, Aston Villa and Manchester City in their next six Premier League games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot saw both sides of his team at Selhurst Park as they failed to make the most of their first-half dominance, but held out at the back for a fifth clean sheet in seven league games.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Palace did have the ball in the net inside 30 seconds but Eddie Nketiah had strayed offside before flicking in Ismaila Sarr's cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Liverpool quickly took control and the lead after just nine minutes when Jota stole in ahead of Marc Guehi and Trevoh Chalobah to prod in Cody Gakpo's low cross.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jota was guilty of passing up the visitors' best chance to add to their lead before the break.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Trent Alexander-Arnold's teasing cross did not get the finish it deserved as the Portugal international sliced well wide of the target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Palace finally flickered into life in first-half stoppage time when Sarr was denied by a fine save from Alisson after finding a gap in the Liverpool defence.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pattern continued into the second period with Liverpool unable to put Palace to bed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Salah should have done better when he fired straight at Dean Henderson after being picked out by a perfect Virgil Van Dijk pass.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jota then headed wide a glorious chance from Alexander-Arnold's free-kick.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Slot's men were nearly made to pay after Jean-Philippe Mateta's introduction perked up the Palace attack.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alisson got down low to his left to parry Nketiah's effort before the Brazilian beat away Eberechi Eze's powerful strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Liverpool were dealt a body blow with 12 minutes remaining when Alisson pulled up with a muscle injury.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Normal back up Caoimhin Kelleher was also absent due to illness so Czech international Vitezslav Jaros was forced into his Liverpool debut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jaros had to make one huge save from Eze and also rushed impressively off his line to deny Mateta a sight of goal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Arsenal and Manchester City could cut the gap at the top back to one point later on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Liverpool will go into the upcoming international break at the summit and happy with the start to life under Slot. (AFP)

    Top EU court finds against Fifa in key transfer ruling

  <img alt="In response to Friday's verdict, Fifa said it would "analyse the decision in coordination with other stakeholders before commenting further." Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773296_1_20241004213538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The EU's top court said on Friday some international football rules regarding the transfers of players are contrary to the bloc's laws, in a landmark decision that could shake up the system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was called on to decide a long-running dispute between former French footballer Lassana Diarra, once of Chelsea and Real Madrid, and world governing body Fifa over what happens when players unilaterally terminate their contract.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a highly anticipated verdict, judges found that by restricting a footballer's ability to seek further employment, current Fifa rules hinder the EU's free movement and competition between clubs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Court holds that all of those rules are contrary to EU law," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The ruling could have far-reaching implications for the transfer market, allowing players to leave their club without fear of being legally trapped afterwards.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Diarra's Belgian lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont, who had dubbed the case "the Bosman 2.0 affair", hailed the new ruling as "a total victory".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dupont was also involved in the landmark 1995 case of the then little-known player Jean-Marc Bosman, which allowed players to move to another club at the end of their contract without a transfer fee being paid and also ended quotas on foreign players at clubs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In response to Friday's verdict, Fifa said it would "analyse the decision in coordination with other stakeholders before commenting further".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Fifa is satisfied that the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been re-confirmed in today's ruling," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The ruling only puts in question two paragraphs of two articles of the Fifa Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, which the national court is now invited to consider."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But global players' union Fifpro called the judgement "a major ruling." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pete Alonso lined a three-run homer to key a four-run ninth-inning rally and lift the New York Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday in the decisive third game of a National League wild-card series.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The sixth-seeded Mets will open the NL Division Series on Saturday at Philadelphia. The second-seeded Phillies won of the NL East, finishing six games ahead of New York and the Atlanta Braves.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Brewers, making their sixth playoff appearance in the last seven years, still haven't won a postseason series since reaching Game 7 of the NL Championship Series in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Francisco Lindor, who had the Mets' only two hits through eight innings, walked to open the ninth against Brewers closer Devin Williams, who saved 14 of 15 during the season and finished Milwaukee's 5-3 win in Game 2.
   <br/>

   A much-changed Tottenham side ground out a 2-1 win away to Hungary's Ferencvaros in the Uefa Europa League on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Goals either side of half-time from Pape Matar Sarr and Brennan Johnson were enough to get Spurs their second win in two games in the competition this season despite a late Barnabas Varga consolation for the home side.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An inexperienced Spurs side made a slow start and Ferencvaros thought they had taken the lead in the 18th minute when Varga nodded home, but VAR ruled that there had been an offside in the build-up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario then displayed lightning-quick reflexes one minute later to claw out Varga's stabbed effort from close range.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier League club grew into the match and broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute when Sarr was the only player in the Ferencvaros box to keep his cool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The home side failed to clear the danger on two occasions before defender Stefan Gartenmann eventually lost his bearings and did not realise the ball was behind him as he ran back towards his own goal, allowing Sarr to pounce and slot home from inside the six-yard box.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The visitors had chances to put the match to bed in the second half, but Timo Werner could only find the side netting after rounding the 'keeper in the 64th minute and Johnson struck the crossbar from distance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As Ferencvaros started to threaten, Johnson got his fifth in as many games with a left-footed finish that kissed the post on its way into the back of the net in the 86th minute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spurs needed the two-goal buffer as Varga directed a whipped cross past Vicario in the 90th minute to set up a nervy finale for Ange Postecoglou's charges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Chelsea marked their first-ever appearance in the Conference League with a 4-2 win over visiting Belgian side Gent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manager Enzo Maresca utilised his large squad, naming an entirely different starting XI to the one that played in the league at the weekend.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Renato Veiga headed Chelsea into the lead in the 12th minute, which Pedro Neto then doubled one minute after the interval.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tsuyoshi Watanabe made it 2-1 in the 50th minute but two goals from Christopher Nkunku and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in seven minutes killed off the tie before Omri Gandelman scored a consolation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A 44th-minute penalty by Michael Baidoo was enough to give Elfsborg a surprise 1-0 win at home to Roma, who sit on one point after two games. (AFP)
