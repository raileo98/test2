<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China-founded e-commerce sites Temu and Shein say they plan to raise prices for US customers starting next week, a ripple effect from US President Donald Trump's attempts to correct the trade imbalance between the world's two largest economies by imposing a sky-high tariff on goods shipped from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, which is now based in Singapore, said in separate notices that their operating expenses have gone up “due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Both companies said they would be making “price adjustments” starting April 25, although neither provided details about the size of the increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since launching in the United States, Shein and Temu have given Western retailers a run for their money by offering products at ultra-low prices, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 145 percent tariff Trump slapped on most products made in China, coupled with his decision to end a customs exemption that allows goods worth less than US$800 to come into the US duty-free, has dented the business models of the two platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  E-commerce companies have been the biggest users of the widely-used exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed an executive order this month to eliminate the “de minimis provision” for goods from China starting May 2, when they will be subject to the 145 percent import tax.
  <br>
  <br>
  As many as four million low-value parcels - most of them originating from China - arrive in the US every day under the soon-to-be cancelled provision.
  <br>
  <br>
  US politicians, law enforcement agencies and business groups lobbied to remove the long-standing exemption, describing it as a trade loophole that gave inexpensive Chinese goods an advantage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shein sells inexpensive clothes, cosmetics and accessories, primarily targeting young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Temu, which promoted its goods through online ads, sells a wider array of products, including household items, humourous gifts and small electronics. (AP)

<img alt="AMD said the new US export control measure applies to MI308 graphics processing units designed for high-performance applications.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chip developer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Wednesday said it expected new US licensing requirements for semiconductors exported to China to cost it as much as US$800 million.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Silicon Valley company's earnings warning, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), came a day after rival Nvidia notified regulators that it expects a US$5.5 billion hit this quarter from licensing requirements on the main chip it can legally sell in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in both companies were down by about 7 percent at the close of formal trading on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new US export control measure applies to MI308 graphics processing units (GPUs) designed for high-performance applications like gaming and artificial intelligence, AMD said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AMD said in the filing that it "expects to apply for (export) licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$800 million earnings blow it forecast would come from charges in "inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US officials last week told Nvidia it must obtain licenses to export its H20 chips to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, the Silicon Valley company said in a SEC filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had already restricted exports to China of Nvidia's most sophisticated GPUs, tailored for powering top-end artificial intelligence models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia was told the licensing requirement on H20 chips would last indefinitely, it said in the filing. (AFP)

<img alt='One analyst said US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell "took what was a moderately down day into a pretty dramatic slide." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800700_1_20250417053537.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve chief warned of the drag from US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while Nvidia sank on costs connected to the US-China trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished at 16,307, down 3.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones dropped 1.7 percent to 39,669, while the S&P 500 shed 2.2 percent to 5,275.
  <br>
  <br>
  US equities opened lower, shrugging off solid retail sales data. But the market dropped much more after Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump's tariffs could put the Federal Reserve in the unenviable position of having to choose between tackling inflation and unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said that while the Fed's employment and inflation goals were largely in balance at this point, policymakers could find themselves in the "challenging scenario" depending on how things evolve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments "sparked stagflation concerns," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell "took what was a moderately down day into a pretty dramatic slide," Ablin added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The remarks come as Trump's wide-ranging trade agenda continues to dominate discussion in business and financial circles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week Trump backed off his most onerous "reciprocal" tariffs for every country except China, while maintaining a range of other levies, including on car imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been little sign of rapprochement between Washington and Beijing, which has responded with increased levies of its own.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia ended down around seven percent after earlier slumping more than 10 percent. The chip company disclosed in a securities filing that it expects a US$5.5 billion hit connected to export licences for technology that the US government determined could be used for a Chinese supercomputer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Advanced Micro Devices, which estimated one-time charges of up to US$800 million, fell 7.4 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tariffs are likely to push up prices and could put the US Federal Reserve in the unenviable position of having to choose between tackling inflation and unemployment, the bank's chair said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Unlike some other central banks, the US Fed has a dual mandate from Congress to ensure both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment over time.
  <br>
  <br>
  It keeps those twin objectives in balance by lowering or raising interest rates, which act as either a throttle or a brake for demand in the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told the Economic Club of Chicago, according to prepared remarks, warning that the inflationary effects "could also be more persistent."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored," he added, echoing similar remarks earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said that the Fed could find itself in the "challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension," noting that price stability is a necessary precondition for "strong labour market conditions."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's stop-start tariff policy has unnerved investors and trading partners unsure about the long-term policy, and what it might mean for international trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most economists have warned that tariffs will push up prices – at least temporarily – while acting as a drag on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has insisted that the levies are just one part of an overall economic platform, including tax cuts and deregulation designed to stimulate supply, boost growth, temper inflation, and return manufacturing jobs to the United States. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global trade is expected to plummet this year in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff offensive, fuelling uncertainty that threatens "severe negative consequences" for the world, the World Trade Organisation warned on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to office, Trump has imposed a 10 percent tariff on imports of goods from around the world along with 25 percent levies on steel, aluminium and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump made a U-turn on steeper tariffs for dozens of countries, he has escalated a trade war with China, slapping 145 percent levies on Chinese goods while Beijing retaliated with a 125 percent duty on US products.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm very concerned," WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told reporters, adding that the organisation expected to see trade volumes between the United States and China crumble by a whopping 81 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, the most vulnerable economies in particular," she warned in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the start of the year, the WTO expected to see global trade expand in 2025 and 2026, with merchandise trade seen growing in line with global GDP, and trade in services growing even faster.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the organisation's annual global trade outlook published on Wednesday, it determined that as things stand, world merchandise trade is on course to fall 0.2 percent this year, "before posting a modest recovery of 2.5 percent in 2026."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 2025 number, calculated in line with the tariff situation on April 14, is already nearly three percentage points lower than what would have been expected without the tariffs Trump has slapped on countries around the globe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Okonjo-Iweala told reporters the "sharp projected decline in US-China bilateral trade" risked more "far-reaching consequences."
  <br>
  <br>
  While US-China trade accounts for just around three percent of world merchandise trade, she warned that what appears to be the ongoing "decoupling of the two economies" could lead to "a broader fragmentation of the global economy along geopolitical lines into two isolated blocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  In that scenario, "our estimates suggest that global ... GDP would be lowered by nearly seven percent in the long term," by 2040, she said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese electric vehicle maker XPeng said it is ramping up technological innovation as part of efforts to further expand into the overseas market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comment came as the Guangzhou-headquartered firm introduced the latest version of its X9 multi-purpose vehicle to the SAR market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The seven-seater is equipped with autonomous driving capabilities powered by its own artificial intelligence chip, and the firm plans to take orders from Europe from the second half of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference held at Kai Tak, XPeng's founder He Xiaopeng said AI technology is key to the company's future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The technology of artificial intelligence has driven the industrial changes for automobiles. And this change, I believe, will lead to all auto firms to establish their own software platforms and greatly increase their research and development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The XPeng founder said the China auto market is highly competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a sense I am actually quite concerned about the car companies in China. For now there are about 400 to 500 car makers in China. I believe in the end, there'll only be about 10 or fewer that can survive."
  <br>
  <br>
  He predicts half of the firm's EV sales will come from the overseas markets in the coming decade, up from 15 percent currently.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EV entrepreneur also said he believes more Chinese brands will enter the global market in the future, with each firm eyeing about 10 to 12 core markets that span across Europe, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Right now, the firm has a presence in more than 30 countries and regions around the world, and it hopes to double that number by the end of the year, with Hong Kong being a launch pad.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the impact of US tariffs, XPeng said it has not sold any EVs in the country but that it will continue to monitor development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a company, we cannot escape the economic volatility that came with the trade tensions. We need to be prepared to make sure that our products continue to sell well," said Brian Gu, the firm's vice chairman and president.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we also need to be prepared that the tariffs may have an impact on the global supply chains."
  <br>
  <br>
  XPeng is also investing in the development of robotics and flying vehicles, in a bid to capitalise on the growing low-altitude economy.

 Asian stocks swung on Wednesday after Nvidia's announcement of new US licensing rules on shipments of its new chip to China rattled investor confidence already shot by Donald Trump's sweeping trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended down 1.91 percent at 21,056.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 2.55 percent to end at 7,779.01, and the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 3.72 percent to end at 4,796.28.
  <br>
  <br>
  After a relatively peaceful couple of days following last week's tariff-fuelled ructions, investors were once again on the defensive as a standoff between the world's top economic superpowers shows no signs of abating.
  <br>
  <br>
  China did little to soothe worries by saying that US levies were putting pressure on its economy, which data showed expanded more than expected in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  A decision by Hong Kong's postal service to stop shipping US-bound goods in response to "bullying" levies added to the unease.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip behemoth Nvidia said on Tuesday that US officials had told the firm it must obtain licences to ship its new H20 semiconductors to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, adding the rule would last indefinitely.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move marks the latest salvo in an increasingly nasty row that has seen Washington and Beijing hit each other with eye-watering tariffs, with the technology sector and security at the heart of the issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  US levies on other trading partners – despite being mostly paused – have sent global markets into a tailspin as governments scramble to cushion themselves from the impact of the measures, with many heading to Washington for talks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has also kicked off an investigation that could see tariffs imposed on critical minerals such as rare earths that are used in a wide range of products including smartphones, wind turbines and electric vehicle motors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Silence is never golden – it's just the calm before the next chaos cycle," said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And sure enough, the tape just got rattled again.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nvidia dropped the mic, revealing fresh export curbs on AI gear headed to China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then came the other shoe: Trump ordering a new probe into tariffs on critical minerals. Boom – just like that, we're back in whiplash mode.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Welcome to the new normal: one step forward, two tariff probes back."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta were also down.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore, Mumbai, Bangkok and Wellington rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  London fell even as UK inflation slowed more than expected in March, while Paris and Frankfurt also retreated.
  <br>

  A weak dollar, and an ongoing run into safe havens, saw gold spike to a fresh record high of US$3,291.81. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday said that there was a good chance the United States and Britain could strike a "great agreement" on trade due to Donald Trump's love of the country and its royal family.
 <br>
  <br>
  Britain was spared the most punitive treatment in the US president's initial tariff announcement, due to the two sides enjoying a largely balanced trade relationship.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's UK correspondent Peter Anderson said the fact that trade was more balanced between the two countries would help in the UK's favour.
  <br>
  <br>
  "His [Vance's] comments also indicated that he felt it would be easier for the US to sign a trade deal with the UK than it would be to sign one with the European countries. And he used the phrase, 'a much more reciprocal relationship with the UK.' And most people perceive that as the fact that it's quite a balanced relationship."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Anderson said the US would still push the UK to make concessions on issues such as technology and food standards, even as it held out the prospect of a trade deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The government here in the UK is seen by the United States as having punitive taxes on tech firms. The so-called digital services tax here in the UK, which has been a problem for companies such as Amazon and Meta," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think the US will be pushing for a wide range of issues, but I certainly think food standards and technical and science matters will be at the fore of that."

    HK eyes e-commerce, silver economy amid challenges

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong needs to seek new growth opportunities amid global uncertainties, such as developing e-commerce and the silver economy, says Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Overview Policy programme on Wednesday, Yau said geopolitical challenges and supply-chain disruptions are affecting the city's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under these circumstances, Hong Kong must seek new ways forward," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many good examples, such as the chief executive leading multiple visits to the Middle East and Asean countries."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the SAR has traditionally relied on trade with Europe and the United States, there is a need to seek new economic partnerships to mitigate geopolitical influences, Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the mainland's impressive e-commerce transaction volumes last year, he said online shopping is one key area that Hong Kong can tap into.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yau said a shopping festival held in August attracted a good response from the mainland, with 230 brands participating and more than 90 million impressions on discussion forums and the official website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister also highlighted the importance of developing a silver economy, noting that around one-third of Hong Kong's population – or 2.67 million people – will be over 65 years old by 2043.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While we need to address welfare issues for elderly people from grassroots groups, there are also many middle-class or better-off seniors who own properties and have pension funds," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "How can we stimulate consumption among this demographic?
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite their substantial economic power, society seems to pay little attention to their spending needs," Yau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government working group on the silver economy is focused on five areas: boosting consumption, developing the industry, promoting quality assurance, enhancing financial security and unleashing productivity.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nvidia on Tuesday notified regulators that it expects a US$5.5 billion hit this quarter due to a new US licensing requirement on the primary chip it can legally sell in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  US officials last week told Nvidia it must obtain licences to export its H20 chips to China because of concerns they may be used in supercomputers there, the Silicon Valley company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia, which have seen high volatility since US President Donald Trump made a major tariffs announcement on April 2, were down more than six percent in after-market trades.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new licensing rule applies to Nvidia GPUs (graphics processing units) with bandwidth similar to that of the H20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States had already restricted exports to China of Nvidia's most sophisticated GPUs, tailored for powering top-end artificial intelligence models.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia was told the licensing requirement on H20 chips would last indefinitely, it said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia's current fiscal quarter ends on April 27.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately US$5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves," Nvidia said in the filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said publicly that the AI chip powerhouse will balance legal compliance and technological advances under Trump, and that nothing will stop the global advancement of artificial intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll continue to do that and we'll be able to do that just fine," the entrepreneur told reporters last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's predecessor Joe Biden restricted Nvidia from selling some of its top AI chips to China, which the United States sees as a competitor in technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global markets have been on a roller coaster since Trump's April 2 announcement, declining sharply before partially recovering with his 90-day pause on the steepest tariff rates last week. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang called on the country's exporters on Tuesday to diversify their markets to cope with external changes, and vowed to support more domestic consumption, in comments on mainland media.
 <br>
  <br>
  China has been hit with the highest tariffs in US President Donald Trump's moves to impose hefty duties on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Trump hiked duties on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting Beijing to jack up levies on US goods to 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At present, profound changes in the external environment have adversely affected China's foreign trade and exports," a radio broadcast cited Li as saying in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should calmly respond to the difficulties and challenges brought by external shocks, promote consumption and expand domestic demand with greater efforts," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese companies should actively explore diversified markets, innovate trade channels and methods, and strive to stabilise foreign trade, Li said.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will help high-quality foreign trade products expand into the domestic market and steadily promote the integrated development of domestic and foreign trade, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports rose sharply in March after factories rushed out shipments before the latest US tariffs took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pledged to take steps to stabilise employment, promote income growth, and strengthen social safety nets to help boost consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is still significant room for development in China’s real estate market and efforts should be made to further unlock market potential, Li said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday following news of solid bank earnings as investors monitor developments in the US-China trade war after last week's market gyrations.
 <br>
  <br>
  "It's quiet," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments. "Right now, you have a situation of digestion or the market consolidating a lot of volatility over the last few weeks."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished 0.4 percent lower at 40,368.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,396 while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 16,823.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors welcomed a calmer US Treasury market after last week's spike in US Treasury bond yields. But there is still a lot of uncertainty among market participants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Will we have relief or progress with the trade tariff situation or is the situation going to get worse?" Sarhan said. "We don't know. That question mark is leading investors to hold off from taking any big positions."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of America rose 3.6 percent, while Citigroup gained 1.8 percent as large lenders concluded a solid round of first-quarter earnings results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Netflix surged 4.8 percent following a Wall Street Journal report that said the streaming company is targeting a doubling of revenue by 2030. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equities mostly rose on Tuesday as some stability returned to markets after last week's rollercoaster ride, with auto firms boosted by US President Donald Trump's possible compromise over steep tariffs on the sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index edged up 0.23 percent to close at 21,466.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.21 percent to end at 7,982.88 while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 0.67 percent to end at 4,981.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Trump's unorthodox approach to trade diplomacy continues to fuel uncertainty among investors, with speculation over new levies on high-end technology and pharmaceuticals dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement last week of exemptions for smartphones, laptops, semiconductors and other electronics – all key Chinese-made products – provided a little comfort, though Trump's suggestion they would be temporary tempered the optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders gave a muted reaction to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks on Monday that a China-US deal could be done in an apparent olive branch as the two economic powerhouses trade tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as Trump has hammered China with duties of up to 145 percent, while Beijing has imposed retaliatory measures of 125 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a big deal to be done at some point", Bessent said when asked by Bloomberg TV about the possibility that the world's largest economies would decouple.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There doesn't have to be" decoupling, he said, "but there could be".
  <br>
  <br>
  After a broadly positive day on Wall Street, other Asian markets also pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Taipei, Mumbai, Manila and Jakarta all rallied, with London and Frankfurt also climbing but Paris edged down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were boosted by a rally in autos after Trump said he was "very flexible" and "looking at something to help some of the car companies" hit by his 25 percent tariff on all imports. (AFP/Xinhua)

<img alt="Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs says the US could face an uphill battle in its trade dispute with China. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1800419_1_20250415112206.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Renowned American economist, Jeffrey Sachs, on Tuesday said US President Donald Trump would not win the trade war against China, as Beijing is no longer as dependent on US markets as it was in the past.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as the world's two largest economies remain in a stand-off over sweeping tariffs that Washington imposed this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Sachs, who teaches economics at Columbia University, said it was a "mistake" for the United States to launch the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's no doubt it started on the US side. The US actions violate international rules, and they violate economic sense. They will create costs, both for the US, for China, and for the rest of the world. But the biggest costs will be borne by the United States, especially US consumers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US consumers will face higher prices and lower living standards, that's why they're pessimistic. Some consumers are already cutting back on their consumption knowing that they're going to suffer a decline of living standards in future months, even with the risk of a recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] I think that the [consumer] costs in China will be much lower," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's shipments to the US amounted to around US$440 billion last year, Sachs said that accounted for only a small share of the country's total US$3.68 trillion worth of exports in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The truth is, the United States is not going to win this trade war, as China is just not as dependent on the US market as Donald Trump seems to think."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sachs, who is also the director of Columbia’s Centre for Sustainable Development, noted the global trading system would remain open despite the sweeping tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The open trading system will continue, but the United States might not be part of it, and this will be at a big cost to the United States, a big economic cost, a big development cost, and a big geopolitical cost."

    EV battery giant CATL records surge in Q1 profit

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The world's leading maker of electric vehicle batteries, CATL, posted a 32.9 percent jump in first quarter profit, even as demand for electric vehicles slows.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, cooperating with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 2011 in the eastern city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit in the first quarter was up 32.9 percent year-on-year to 13.96 billion yuan (US$1.91 billion), according to a statement CATL released on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the same period, CATL's sales rose by 6.2 percent year-on-year to 84.7 billion yuan, the filing showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL has been aided by strong financial support from Beijing, which has sought in recent years to shore up domestic strength in certain strategic high-tech sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, CATL warned in January that its slide in sales last year was likely due to a "decline in the prices of raw materials such as lithium carbonate", which had forced the firm to adjust prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last year saw lithium prices fall significantly, partly due to market oversupply and weaker consumer demand for EVs. (AFP)

<img alt="Apple and other tech companies helped lift Wall Street after President Trump said he was exempting electronics from some of his stiff tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rose worldwide on Monday after US President Donald Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least, and as stress from within the US bond market seems to be easing.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 percent to 5,405, though trading was still shaky, and it briefly gave back all of its big early gain of 1.8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.8 percent to 40,524, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6 percent to 16,831.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple and other technology companies helped lift Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs, which could ultimately more than double prices for US customers of products coming from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such an exemption would mean US importers don't have to choose between passing on the higher costs to their customers or taking a hit to their own profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple climbed 2.2 percent, and Dell Technologies rose 4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Automakers also rallied after Trump suggested he may announce pauses on tariffs next for the auto industry. General Motors rose 3.5 percent, and Ford Motor rallied 4.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs rose 1.9 percent after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It joined other big banks in doing so, such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bond market also showed signs of increasing calm. Treasury yields eased following their sudden rise last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields usually drop when fear is high in the market because US government bonds have historically been seen as some of the world’s safest investments, if not the safest.
  <br>
  <br>
  But last week, yields rose sharply for Treasury bonds in an usual move.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of the US dollar also fell against other currencies in another move suggesting investors may no longer see the United States as the best place to keep their cash during moments of stress.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased back to 4.37 percent. It had jumped to 4.48 percent on Friday from 4.01 percent the week before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of the US dollar, though, remained under pressure. It slipped against the euro and Japanese yen, while inching higher against the Canadian dollar. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rose on Monday as trade war fears were tempered by US President Donald Trump's announcement of tariff exemptions for electronics, although the greenback weakened and safe-haven gold hit a fresh record amid fears the relief would be short-lived.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market ended higher with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 2.4 percent at 21,417.40.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 2.11 percent to end at 7,965.81, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 2.34 percent to end at 5,015.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the wild gyrations witnessed last week, markets got off to a relatively stable start following Friday's news that the White House would exempt smartphones, semiconductors, computers and other devices from painful "reciprocal" levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement provided a much-needed injection of optimism for investors who had been sent scurrying for the hills in the wake of the US president's tariff flip-flops and tit-for-tat measures by China.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three main indexes on Wall Street finished solidly higher, helped by comments from a top Federal Reserve official that the central bank was prepared to step in to support financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia followed suit, with tech firms helping push Hong Kong more than two percent higher, while Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Jakarta and Manila were also well up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt also saw big gains in the morning, while US futures were all sharply higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After a period of chaotic price action, chinks of light poke through the forest canopy providing a much-needed guide to the entities that price risk and liquidity for a living, which in turn, may see liquidity conditions improve and a relative calm return to markets," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Trump looked to temper the remarks on Sunday, saying the exemptions had been misconstrued and writing on his Truth Social platform that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'... especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!"
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he would announce new tariffs on semiconductors "over the next week".
  <br>
  <br>
  His commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said earlier chip levies would likely be in place "in a month or two".
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping said on Monday that protectionism leads nowhere and that a trade war would have no winners, days after Beijing hit US goods with 125 percent duties but also suggested it would not retaliate further in the future. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports rose 12.4 percent year-on-year in March, beating analysts' expectations as the world's second largest economy braces for an intensifying trade war with the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Customs data also showed on Monday that imports contracted 4.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Export growth last month was driven by Chinese factories rushing out shipments ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announced on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lyu Daliang, a spokesman for the General Administration of Customs, said China is facing a severe and complex external situation, but that the sky would not fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In recent years, China has actively diversified its markets and deepened industrial and supply chain cooperation with partners worldwide. This has not only fuelled the development of other economies, but also strengthened our own resilience," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moreover, China's vast domestic market serves as a crucial stabilising force. We will remain steadfast in focusing on our own priorities, using our internal certainty to navigate external uncertainties."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has ramped up duties on Chinese goods to eye-watering levels of 145 percent, prompting Beijing to raise retaliatory tariffs on US imports. (Agencies)

 A leading commentator on Chinese affairs on Monday said the US trade war would prove costly for all concerned, including the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>
    <b>

   </u>
  </a>
  , Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, said China would not only defend its interests, but also protect the world trading order.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this round of the trade war, the United States is absolutely the wrong party. It started the war. It instigated the war. It used maximum pressure and intimidation against almost all the other countries, and China needs to do the right thing, that is jump up to the occasion and fiercely defend its legitimate interests," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And also, for the rest of the world, China needs to exercise a leadership role in defending free trade."
  <br>
  <br>
  Gao said American consumers would suffer as the tariffs made goods more expensive and suspected Washington was using the threat of import taxes to weaponise the global trading system to its own ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It still demonstrates that the US administration, as far as the maximum tariffs are concerned, is still using these tariffs as a weapon, trying to achieve other goals," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether it's blackmail, maximum pressure, intimidation, or bringing in other strategic goals, it remains to be seen. Therefore, I think, the Chinese position is to call on the US government to do the right thing and to cancel all the tariffs, because that is the only right thing to do."

 Tariff exemptions announced on Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of US tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the US. (AP)

 US President Donald Trump's administration has granted exclusions from steep reciprocal tariffs to smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a notice to shippers, the US Customs and Border Protection agency published a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes. The exclusions are retroactive to 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) on April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US CBP listed 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays. The notice did not provide an explanation for the move, but the late-night exclusion provides welcome relief to major technology firms such as Apple, Dell Technologies and many other importers.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. (Reuters, AP)

 Argentina dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso on Friday as it sealed a US$20 billion, 48-month Extended Fund Facility deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 <br>
  <br>
  The IMF deal lays out an immediate disbursement US$12 billion, and a first review is planned for June with an associated additional disbursement of some US$2 billion, the IMF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South American nation's central bank announced that it will undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina will eliminate major parts of the so-called "cepo" capital controls that have restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies from this year will also be able to repatriate profits out of the country, a key demand from businesses that could unlock more investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of Monday, we will be able to put an end to the foreign exchange restrictions which were imposed in 2019 and which limit the normal functioning of the economy," Economy Ministry Luis Caputo said at a press conference.  (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Friday, concluding a rollercoaster week on a positive note amid hopes that the market has absorbed the worst headlines about trade conflicts.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities shrugged off early weakness after China announced 125 percent tariffs on US goods in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that escalation, traders hope "that we're going to pivot from the phase of escalation to negotiation and hopefully further down the road to de-escalation," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potentially "a lot of bad news is in the price already," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,353.36, up 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 1.6 percent to 40,212.71, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.1 percent to 16,724,46.
  <br>
  <br>
  US equities this week have gyrated as markets digest President Trump's shifting announcements on tariffs and the evolving stance of other parties, including the European Union, which unveiled and then paused countermeasures earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, economists point to a rising risk of a US recession amid worries about inflation. On Friday, a survey from the University of Michigan noted a sharp drop in consumer confidence, and flagged a worrying rise in both short-term and longer-term inflation expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are also turning attention to quarterly earnings season, which began in earnest on Friday with large banks and financial players.
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan Chase surged 4.0 percent following better than expected results, while BlackRock gained 2.3 percent and Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo lost 1.0 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US dollar tumbled along with most stocks while gold hit a fresh record high as panic gripped markets again on Friday, while China retaliated against Donald Trump's latest tariff blitz against the world's number two economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing raised the tariffs on US imports to 125 percent near the end of trading in stocks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.13 percent to close at 20,914.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.74 percent to end at 7,801.51 while the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8 percent to end at 4,900.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president's decision to delay crippling duties for 90 days sparked a frenzied scramble for equities that had been beaten down since his "Liberation Day" announcement unleashed a global panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the realisation that nothing had been resolved, coupled with Trump's decision to double down on his battle with economic superpower China, fuelled another bout of selling of US assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The greenback tanked against the yen, euro, pound and Swiss franc – investors dropping what is usually considered a key safe haven currency as they look to unload US risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold-standard Treasuries were also under pressure amid speculation that China was offloading some of its vast holdings in retaliation for Trump's measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weaker dollar and the rush for safety has also sent bullion to a fresh record high above US$3,220.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Beijing's latest tariffs move made in response to Trump, President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying" by Washington, state media said as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, Beijing said it would ramp up levies against the United States to 125 percent, compared with the 145 percent China faces.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Washington's moves defied "basic economic laws and common sense" and "seriously violates international trade rules" but said it would "ignore" future US hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets across the region were back deep in negative territory at the end of a highly volatile week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo shed 3 percent – a day after surging more than 9 percent – while Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington and Bangkok were also in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said earlier in the day that it would implement a moderately loose monetary policy in a bid to reassure investors. (AFP/Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibitions and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong on Friday said the world had entered a new period of uncertainty and disruption because of the US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

 Hong Kong stocks fell on Friday, hurt by growing concerns about the US trade war and the potential for a global recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 124 points, or 0.6 percent, to open at 20,557 points, while the tech sub-index was 0.5 percent weaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index on the mainland and the Shanghai Composite Index were flat, losing just 0.1 percent at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 share index was down 5.6 percent in early trading, while shares also fell in South Korea and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses of US stocks accelerated after the White House clarified that the United States will tax Chinese imports at 145 percent, not the 125 percent rate that Trump had written about in his posting on Truth Social Wednesday. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Continuing jitters about US tariffs hit Asian stocks in early trade on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei tumbling more than five percent and gold hitting another record high.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China. Levies on Chinese imports are now at a total of 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, the Nikkei 225 was off 5.4 percent, having soared 9.1 percent on Thursday after Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other markets also handed back many of their gains of the previous day, with the Kospi in Seoul off 1.64 percent and Sydney down more than two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil and the US dollar also slid on fears of a global slowdown in economic activity, while gold hit a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow safe-haven asset the yen also gained 0.9 percent against the dollar on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump maintained a 10 percent blanket tariff on most countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he paused plans for tariffs of 20 percent on the European Union and even higher levies on multiple other trade partners, including 24 percent on Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday that the EU was "very smart" to back off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China even as the bloc's chief warned it could tax US Big Tech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(The EU) were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property developer Country Garden said on Friday it had reached an agreement with creditors holding nearly 30 percent of its existing offshore bond debt and was close to finalising terms with another group of bank creditors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposed restructuring covers aggregate outstanding principal amount of US$14.07 billion of its existing debt, Country Garden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had proposed the plan to cut its offshore debt by US$11.6 billion in January. Creditors holding 29.9 percent of US$10.3 billion in bonds had agreed to the plan, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also close to finalising a deal with a lender group made up of seven banks who hold three syndicated loans with an outstanding principal amount of US$3.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate firm has offered five restructuring options to its bondholders including extending the maturity by as much as 11.5 years alongside choosing mandatory convertible bonds and new debt instruments. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another battering on Thursday, giving back a sizeable portion of the prior session's gains as investors grappled with lingering uncertainty about US President Donald Trump's trade and economic policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent the entire day in the red, disappointing traders who had been hoping to extend Wednesday's rally following Trump's pivot on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished down 3.5 percent at 5,268. The index had soared 9.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5 percent to 39,593, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.3 percent to 16,387.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's historic rally followed Trump's decision to pause for 90 days many of his most onerous tariffs on trading partners, while doubling down on levies on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks wiped out trillions of dollars in value in the sessions after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement before the president's reversal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But by Thursday, investors realized that Trump's tariff pause "is not enough to get people back in this market," said Peter Tuchman, senior floor trader at TradeMas Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed that US consumer inflation contracted 0.1 percent from a month earlier in a reading that was lower than analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traders have been unnerved by the massive reversals in Trump's policies, resulting in uncertainty that economists warn can paralyse consumers and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Energy was the biggest loser among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, where 10 groups finished in the red. Only consumer staples mustered a small gain. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump is said to have posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that 'IT'S TIME TO BUY', hours before he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several American senators have called for an investigation into whether US President Donald Trump engaged in insider trading or market manipulation by encouraging people to buy stocks just before his dramatic reversal on global tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense?" California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff posted on X on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm writing to the White House – the public has a right to know," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee wrote on X that "the President of the United States is literally engaging in the world's biggest market manipulation scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations came as Trump posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that "IT'S TIME TO BUY".
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later, he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs against dozens of countries, with the exception of China, triggering a historic stock market rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several days of collapse, the Dow Jones index ended Wednesday up 7.87 percent, its biggest gain since 2008, and the Nasdaq up 12.16 percent, the most since 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed his post on Truth Social with the letters "DJT" – both his initials and the stock market abbreviation for his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company's shares closed the day up 21.67 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rocketed on Thursday as a relief rally spread through markets after Donald Trump paused crippling tariffs on US partners, with Chinese investors even brushing off his decision to ramp up duties on Beijing to 125 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 2.06 percent at 20,681.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marks a third day of gains after it collapsed more than 13 percent on Monday in its worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.76 percent to end at 7,668.38, and the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 2.66 percent to end at 4,813.74.
  <br>
  <br>
  The across-the-board gains by markets tracked a blistering performance on Wall Street as the US president said he would delay for 90 days measures announced last week that set off a firestorm on trading floors and sparked global recession fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would keep in place a basic levy of 10 percent on dozens of countries but upped the ante in his brutal trade war with superpower rival China by hitting it even harder after it retaliated.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's own 84 percent retaliatory measures kicked in on Thursday, later saying that the United States "goes against the whole world" with the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei surged more than 9 percent, while Taipei's 9.3 percent gain was its best rise on record – after Monday's 9.7 percent drop represented its worst fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Shanghai markets have been given extra support by optimism that China will unveil fresh stimulus to support its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul, Singapore, Jakarta, Sydney, Saigon and Bangkok climbed between four and 6.6 percent. Manila and Wellington were also well in the positive territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, Paris and Frankfurt cruised more than six percent higher and London rallied more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech firms were the standout performers, with Sony, Sharp, Panasonic and SoftBank chalking up double-digit gains, while airlines, car makers and casinos also enjoyed strong buying. (AFP/Xinhua)

 Postal Savings Bank of China has announced a commitment to provide no less than 10 trillion yuan in financing to private businesses over the next five years, reinforcing its dedication to supporting the country's private sector amid economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lender said it is expected to earmark at least three trillion yuan specifically for technology innovators and over three trillion yuan targeting agricultural sector development, as part of efforts to help more than 5,000 companies in the private sector enhance their governance capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The major state-owned commercial bank, in partnership with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently introduced an action plan aimed at empowering private enterprises, targeting operational growth, technological innovation and digital transformation, among other critical areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key programs under the plan include a tailored financing pipeline for private companies, tech R&D support packages, and digital upgrades for small businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2024, the bank's outstanding loans to private enterprises had reached 2.44 trillion yuan – which served over 3.4 million businesses. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday the integration of artificial intelligence technology into the fintech industry could help turbocharge financial development across Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the government-owned investment body, Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), launched a strategic partnership with locally-based virtual bank, WeLab Bank, to further enrich the city's fintech ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the partnership, Chan noted that the city's fintech industry, with firms numbering some 1,100, has seen rapid growth over the past year, rising by five places to rank fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index in terms of fintech evaluations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it's essential for the industry to incorporate the latest AI technology into its services so as to transform the finance and banking systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, AI technologies can uncover correlations between seemingly unrelated factors, enabling the identification of credit worthiness in individuals who might otherwise be regarded as unqualified for lending," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is exactly what WeLab is achieving for its innovative technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident that through this partnership HKIC and WeLab can assist more local and regional enterprises to leverage AI and fintech, thereby unlocking the potential of finance, to support economic development across Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan hoped the strategic partnership can help more SAR firms tap into overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WeLab has already established a foundation in southeast Asia, their contacts, experience, and ability there can help these companies to accelerate their expansion into the overseas markets there," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2019, WeLab Bank said it has been ramping up its adoption of AI in recent years and has integrated DeepSeek's AI models into its local system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The virtual lender has just reported its first monthly profit in December as it speeds up expansion into the southeast Asian market, including Indonesia and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKIC, meanwhile, has also struck a strategic partnership deal with chipmaker, StarFive, to speed up the adoption of the popular RISC-V chips, an open-source architecture used to design less-sophisticated semiconductors, in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lego has opened a US$1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country hopes the plant’s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing. (AP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Thursday said China was justified in retaliating against US tariffs with trade levies of its own.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Lam said the country was only responding to what he said were America's "bullying tactics", but held out hope that a deal could eventually be worked out between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is always open to a fair talk, you know, sitting at the table, not by just starting something, you know, adding 10 percent, 10 percent, 34 percent and 50 percent, forcing other countries to accept [their terms]...  I think we should all sit down and talk about it."
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lam expressed confidence that Hong Kong could weather the storm, he said things could get tough if the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continued, adding he was working with the government to ensure support for local exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am asking the government to help. I met with HKMA the other day, first of all, I asked them to ask the banks to extend loans, loan repayment periods. So this is first very, very important and essential. And I also [asked] to extend the interest only repayment relief, which is the payment holiday for 12 more months."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer prices fell for the second straight month in March, as caution grows over the economic outlook amid mounting tariff risks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent last month from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. That was slower than February's 0.7 percent decline, but missed the Reuters poll forecast for prices to remain flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.4 percent month-on-month, against a 0.2 percent fall in February and missing an estimated 0.3 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, edged up 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, reversing a 0.1 percent fall in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index, meanwhile, declined 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, deepening the 2.2 percent fall in February, the weakest in four months and below the expected 2.3 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing unveiled a series of measures to boost the economy last year, including cutting interest rates and cancelling restrictions on the purchase of homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation’s economic recovery is also facing headwinds after US President Donald Trump further raised tariffs on China to 125 percent. (Reuters/AFP)

    France cuts growth forecast for 2025 on tariff fears

<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government has cut its growth forecast for 2025 because of the uncertainty over world trade, the economy minister said on Wednesday just hours after US President Donald Trump paused a massive hike in tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had forecast annual growth of 0.9 percent when presenting its 2025 budget, but Economy Minister Eric Lombard told TF1 television that it would be trimmed to 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of France had already revised its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7 percent in March, and the French Economic Observatory (OFCE) lowered its forecast to 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about a possible further downward revision, the minister said that "would depend on the negotiations that will be initiated with the United States and the decisions that are taken on customs duties."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we succeed in lowering tariffs, we could even get better, and if not, we will see," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lombard ruled out raising taxes in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before his interview, Trump announced that he was suspending levies on all countries except China for three months, after US bond and equity markets had tumbled for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good news, but we must remain calm," Lombard told LCI television, saying he hoped to find "a new agreement" with the Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau welcomed the US move which he called "a return to economic realism and a little reality". But he warned that US policy remained "unpredictable" and that there would be a "negative impact" in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy, which exports much more to the US than France, earlier in the day halved its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.6 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher on Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones surged 7.9 percent to 40,608, and the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq jumped 12.2 percent to 17,124.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indexes bounced on Wednesday afternoon as Trump announced a 90-day pause in country-specific tariffs that came into place earlier that day, except levies on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affected US trading partners, excluding China, would instead face a 10 percent tariff rate, temporarily reverting to a level that took effect over the weekend, though that already roiled markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump singled out the world's second biggest economy, however, saying its tariff rate would be raised to a prohibitive 125 percent "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were waiting for any sense of a more reasonable trade process, saying this situation might "be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he cautioned that "China will become hyper-aware of the fact that they're now being isolated in this process." (AFP)

 Equities tumbled on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war by hitting China with tariffs of more than 100 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a brief respite on Tuesday, investors were once again panicking amid fears Trump's latest moves will spark a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly four percent, while South Korea's Kospi fell 1.74 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hong Kong stocks bucked the downward trend as reports say Beijing is mulling stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index closed up 0.68 percent to close at 20,264.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reuters news agency has reported that the nation's top leaders plan to meet as soon as Wednesday to hammer out measures to boost the economy and stabilise capital markets. (Agencies)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index has been volatile amid a tit-for-tat tariffs fight that may escalate even further after Donald Trump's 50 percent levy takes effect on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799583_1_20250409143912.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 50 percent in extra US duties levied on imports from China on Wednesday have further accelerated deleveraging by investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  That comes as part of a risk-off mode taken by investors following escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, according to financial experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they warned that those investors who saw market downturns as an opportunity and went along with market momentum could find themselves on the short end of the stick as a result of volatilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,815 at the noon trading break, just as the new tariffs by the United States took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decline marked the index's lowest level since January 23, while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1 percent and mainland shares also returned to the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter which market you are talking about, they cannot avoid the three 'T's, which are Trump, trade and tariffs," said Feng Shuyan, an independent portfolio manager, who previously worked with Chubb investment management as associate general manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the latest market trend reflected the rather bearish sentiment among investors, which sped up ongoing deleveraging, and that such a downward trend might continue in the SAR given it is a free port.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre and is more correlated to global stock market performance," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, it will probably experience lots of volatilities, you will ride roller coasters, as the volatility, the deleveraging, the liquidation process will continue to bite," she told RTHK, adding that institutional investors' reductions on risk assets will further weigh on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cash is king, so maybe place a safe bet, " she advised investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, James Wong, chief executive of Almagest Asset Management, said the latest market retreat came amid speculation over the so-called "Mar-a-Lago Accord", a phrase coined last year that refers to efforts to weaken the US dollar and thereby reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market participants tend to think that the US is going to have this tariff coalition, and the receiving end of that coalition is going to be China, so it's going to be a duel between two giants now," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, I think none of the market participants are eager to get into the market and the short-term fluctuations are hardly indicators that can help us judge what is the general flow of capital and where the market is heading."
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggests investors stay calm and not chase the momentum to avoid a "1929 incident", which saw a market crash on Wall Street that year and led to the largest recession in modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you're chasing momentum, chances are you are going to be played out by the volatility," he said, noting that other assets such as bonds from Australia could instead be favoured by investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What could happen next is going to be very, very messy, in our opinion, and the general direction is that the capital markets is going down for a prolonged period."

<img alt="HKTDC's Irina Fan says Hong Kong's diversified trade links will help it withstand any pressure from new US tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

 Mainland and Hong Kong shares fell at the open on Wednesday as the US trade war escalated, following Washington's decision to impose 104 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, starting around noon, Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index sank 3.14 percent, or 632 points, to 19,494, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.13 percent, or 35 points, to 3,110.
  <br>

  Elsewhere in the region, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index initially lost nearly four percent on opening, and markets in South Korea, New Zealand and Australia also declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's currency meanwhile fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2009, while oil prices slumped three percent in early Asian trade. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled again on Tuesday as initially successful efforts to rebound from big losses faded amid worries over US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent to 4,982, its first close below 5,000 points in nearly a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended down 0.8 percent at 37,645, a swing of about 1,780 points below its session peak, while the Nasdaq shed 2.2 percent to 15,267.
  <br>
  <br>
  After three days of losses, Wall Street stocks opened buoyantly as traders embraced talk of White House negotiations with Japan and South Korea in the hopes Trump's trade onslaught might be short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investors grew edgy as the day progressed with no concrete progress. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed plans for massive tariffs on China to go into effect overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously investors are clamouring for clarity and there still isn't any," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, who estimated that the market now sees a greater than 50 percent chance of a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's "Liberation Day" event announcing tariffs on major US trading partners last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials have signalled openness to dealmaking while blasting China for enacting sharp retaliatory tariffs in response to the new US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump plans to impose another 50 percent duty on Chinese goods at midnight, bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished the day in the red, while most of the Dow was also in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Especially big losers in the blue-chip index included Apple, down five percent and Nike, down 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But UnitedHealth Group surged 5.4 percent after the Trump administration finalised a rule boosting payments to insurers under the government Medicare programme. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to "fight to the end" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain "the smooth operation of the capital market".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt rose more than one percent, having dropped more than four percent on Monday. (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.

 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

<img alt="JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799345_1_20250408084713.jpg%253Fulb%253Dtrue%2526quality%253D99%2526w%253D1080&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Monday that US President Donald Trump's tariffs will likely lift inflation, describing himself as "very cautious" in light of the rising recession risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon, an influential figure in markets as the longest serving CEO of a major Wall Street firm, said the US economy had been steady "for years" but was "already weakening" even before Trump's watershed tariff announcement last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on investments and capital flows, the effect on corporate profits and the possible effect on the US dollar," Dimon wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back," said Dimon, adding "my most serious concern is how this will affect America's long-term economic alliances."
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan analysts published a note on Friday expecting US GDP to contract this year "under the weight of the tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also recently raised their risk of global recession to 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that if most of Trump's April 9 tariffs take effect, these charges - alongside likely sectoral duties - could tip their forecast to a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and global equities have been in free fall since Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week in a move the president touted as "Liberation Day" from international trade rules he argues have harmed the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation, along with continued high fiscal deficits, "the remilitarization of the world" and major investments supporting infrastructure and the green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While inflation has come down, most of what I see in the future is inflationary," said Dimon, who backs the need for reducing the US deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These large deficits are not sustainable - I do not know whether it will cause a real problem in six months or six years - the sooner we deal with it, the better," Dimon said. (AFP)

<img alt="The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 both closed less than a percentage lower, while the Nasdaq rose slightly.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Monday following a volatile session amid rising recession worries due to US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow and S&P 500 ended lower despite flirting with positive territory, while the Nasdaq mustered a modest gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.9 percent at 37,965.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,062.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 15,603.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets again opened sharply lower following a gloomy round in Asian and European bourses on the weakening global growth outlook after Trump's sweeping tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the opening, major indices briefly surged into positive territory following a report that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials quickly denied the story, saying that in an interview on Fox News this official was misquoted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though Kevin Hassett was misquoted, market participants could see what would happen if there is a modicum of good news," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management, who is among market watchers who consider stocks oversold after the recent period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists see the tariffs as boosting the risk of recession in light of a possible resurgence in inflation and a slowdown in capital investment from businesses unsettled by shifting US policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with traders overwhelmingly projecting such a move at the central bank's June meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes updates on US consumer prices, as well as earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large US banks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Monday amid worries that a trade war induced by US President Donald Trump's tariffs will spark a global economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices were down more than 3 percent in early trading, reflecting continued angst after Trump's team over the weekend shrugged off the worldwide carnage in markets since his tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was down 3.8 percent in early trading, coming off its worst week since Covid; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,343 points, or 3.5 percent; and the Nasdaq composite was 4.2 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indices were at more than one-year lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump remained defiant on Monday. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, within the first hour of trading, stocks were swinging up, then down again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow briefly erased a loss of 1,700 points, shot up more than 800 points, then went back to a loss of 414 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 likewise made sudden up-and-down lurching movements and was down 1.3 percent in the first hour of trading. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)
