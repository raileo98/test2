<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was "too soon" to consider changes to US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  "CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. "I fully intend to serve all of my term," he said during the Virginia event. (AFP)

    Major Wall Street indices fall by over 5 percent

<img alt="A trader on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798992_1_20250405045214.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another bruising sell-off on Friday as major indices slumped more than five percent following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent the entire session in the red, shrugging off solid employment figures and fixating on China's quick retaliation against the US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 led the major indices lower, ending at 5,074.08, down 6.0 percent for the day and more than nine percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 5.8 percent to 15,587.79, placing it in a bear market, defined as a 20 percent fall from a recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.5 percent to 38,314.86, its first close under 40,000 points since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses increased somewhat following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation due to tariff increases he characterized as "significantly larger than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, government data showed the US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets focused on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've essentially got an escalating trade war," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "We're at the beginning of a global slowdown if these tariffs remain in place."
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell while the Dow index was overwhelmingly a sea of red, with Apple falling 7.3 percent, Chevron 8.2 percent and Boeing 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were a few equities that rebounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nike and Lululemon Athletica rose three percent or more after Trump spoke optimistically about trade talks with Vietnam, from which both companies import apparel. Clothing importers had been among the most hard-hit sectors on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homebuilders were another bright spot in light of falling mortgage rates as markets bet on easing monetary policy. Lennar rose 2.4 percent, while KB Home tacked on 3.5 percent. (AFP)

    Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer

<img alt="The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798987_1_20250405031437.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added on Friday that he would "continue working in good faith with China."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. "TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful," said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called "The People's Bid for TikTok", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble again, extending rout on trade war

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street are still heading south. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798973_1_20250404221313.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Friday, shrugging off solid US hiring data and extending a rout after China retaliated in kind to President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices were stuck in the red, pointing to another brutal session after the S&P 500 on Thursday experienced its largest drop since 2020 following Trump's sweeping "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 15 minutes into trading, the broad-based S&P 500 was down 3.2 percent at 5,223.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slumped 2.8 percent to 39,412, while the Nasdaq 3.6 percent to 15,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated and significantly above February's revised 117,000 figure, said the Department of Labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets fixated on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his plan, saying on his Truth Social platform that "my policies will never change."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's trend marks a "continuation of the worry regarding the announcement of the US tariffs on Wednesday, combined with China's quicker-than-expected retaliatory tariffs," said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stovall said investors are ignoring the jobs data, in part because it could lead the Federal Reserve to "continue to remain on the sidelines" following talk that the weakened US outlook with tariffs might prompt the central bank to cut interest rates more quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell, led by energy, with petroleum producers and services companies sliding on a drop in oil prices amid the feeble demand outlook. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street led a global markets bloodbath on Thursday as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's trade war, while the White House insisted the US economy will emerge victorious.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 4.8 percent in its biggest loss since 2020. The tech-rich Nasdaq plummeted 6.0 percent and the Dow Jones 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shock waves also tore through markets in Asia and Europe in the wake of Trump's Wednesday announcement, while foreign leaders signaled readiness to negotiate but also threatened counter-tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump slapped 10 percent import duties on all nations and far higher levies on imports from dozens of specific countries, including top trade partners China and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate tariffs of 25 percent on all foreign-made cars also went into effect and Canada swiftly responded with a similar levy on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat, paused production at some Canadian and Mexican assembly plants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump dismissed the turmoil, insisting to reporters as he left for a weekend at his Florida golf resorts, that stocks will "boom."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old president says he wants to make the United States free from reliance on foreign manufacturers, in a massive economic reshaping that he likened to a medical procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's what is expected," he said of the market reaction. "The patient was very sick. The economy had a lot of problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went through an operation. It's going to be a booming economy. It's going to be amazing." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets and the dollar tumbled on Thursday after President Donald Trump's latest tariffs salvo against countries worldwide, fanning a trade war that many fear will spark recession and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dollar slumped by as much as 2.6 percent versus the euro, its biggest intraday plunge in a decade, and suffered sharp losses also against the yen and British pound.
  <br>
  <br>
  On stock markets, Wall Street's main indices opened sharply lower, with the Nasdaq falling more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The simultaneous decline in both stocks and the US dollar speaks volumes about investor confidence in Trump's trade policy," said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in apparel companies, which rely on cheap labour in factories abroad, with Nike sinking 11 percent and Gap shedding 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the globe, shares in major sectors including auto, luxury and banking also took big hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed by more than four percent, and the Paris stock market led losses in Europe as it fell over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices plummeted around seven percent to under US$70 per barrel as an economic downturn would hit demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold, a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 an ounce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on government bonds, another haven investment, fell as investors fled risky assets. (AFP)

 Equity markets tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump delivered a "haymaker" blow with sweeping tariffs against US partners and rivals, fanning a global trade war that many fear will spark recessions and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26.

  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: "President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street "had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve "pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo pared its hefty drop but still ended down 2.8 percent, while Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Wellington managed to eke out a small gain as New Zealand faced smaller tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt all tumbled more than one percent, while Vietnam's stock exchange dived 7.8 percent after the country was hit with levies of almost 50 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures were also battered, with the Dow dropping two percent, the Nasdaq plunging more than three percent and the S&P 500 off 2.8 percent off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Safe havens rallied as traders sought to dump risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 and the yen strengthened to 147.04 per dollar from 150.50 the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other currencies, the euro and pound both jumped more than one percent against the dollar on fears about the US economy and bets that the Fed will have to cut interest rates to deal with the impact on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big corporate losers, Sony shed 4.8 percent, while its South Korean rival Samsung was down 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car titan Toyota was off more than five percent, Nissan lost 3.7 percent and Honda was down 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-listed tech investment firm SoftBank was off close to four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed e-commerce giants fell after the removal of a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China.

    Tariffs will rebound on US: economists

<img alt="The punitive 54 percent tariffs heaped on Chinese exports from such ports as Qingdao in Shandong can be counterbalanced by pro-active promotions of domestic consumption, says an economist. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798796_1_20250403160427.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union," Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost "every single country" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at  Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that "what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on].
  <br>
  <br>
  "The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that "we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the "de minimis" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war "closer to home", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention," said d'Assier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And they have means to retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."
  <br>
  <br>
  D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'".

 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described US President Donald Trump's universal tariffs as a major blow to the world economy and said that the European Union was prepared to respond with countermeasures if negotiations failed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel," she said in a statement read out in Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, on Thursday ahead of an EU-Central Asia partnership summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier unveiled a 10 percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States – with a higher 20 percent rate for the European Union – kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall US and global economic growth. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks sank more than two percent in opening trades on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against trade partners, including 34 percent on imports from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index dropped 2.43 percent, or 564 points, to 22,638, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.91 percent, or 30 points, to 3,319.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial markets have been jolted by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements, with US stock futures down by as much as three percent early on Thursday and Tokyo’s market leading losses in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices sank more than US$2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the price of gold hit a new record, crossing its previous record at around Wednesday 2300 GMT and then continuing to climb above US$3,150 an ounce, as traders piled into the safe haven asset. (Agencies)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798734_1_20250403084633.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to "fight" against US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he warned will "fundamentally change the global trading system."
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's unveiling of 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world and harsh additional levies on key trading partners ignited global anger, but for Canada the impact of the latest announcement was limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously announced US levies on Canadian steel and aluminium remain in place. Canada may also be hit hard by Trump's auto sector tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But America's northern neighbour and largest trading partner was not singled out for additional tariffs, and Canadian goods compliant with an existing North American free trade agreement appear exempt from new levies for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney noted that Trump's latest announcement "preserved a number of important elements of our relationship, the commercial relationship between Canada and the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who replaced Justin Trudeau last month, said Trump's trade war will "negatively" impact the US economy and will "directly affect millions of Canadians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to fight these tariffs with counter measures. We are going to protect our workers," Carney said in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a crisis it is important to come together and it is essential to act with purpose and with force and that is what we will do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week in a call with Trump, the pair agreed to discuss the future of bilateral trade after the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls currently project Carney's Liberal Party will win a majority. (AFP)

    US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese

 Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are "not the act of a friend" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia will however not retaliate against the announced 10-percent tariff with its own trade duties, the prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the act of a friend," Albanese told a news conference after Trump's tariff announcement, saying one in four Australian jobs depended on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Australian leader, who faces a tightly contested general election on May 3, said Australia charged nothing on US imports and should face zero US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has been Australia's strongest military ally since World War II, and the two countries have joined with Britain in a deal to provide Australia's navy with stealthy nuclear-powered submarines.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new measures could change how people see their relationship, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations long-standing friendship," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship," the Australian leader added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian blue-chip stocks dipped nearly two percent in early trade as one of the first global markets reacted to Trump's trade action. (AFP)

  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,670, but only after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1 percent and a later gain of 1.1 percent. It’s had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 235 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 42,225, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 percent to close at 17,601. Both also veered from sharply lower in the morning to sharply higher in the afternoon before doubling back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla helped knock the market around after initially falling more than 6 percent following a report that it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last year’s first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla is one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of its immense size, and it’s faced backlash due to anger about CEO Elon Musk’s leading the US government’s efforts to cut spending. But its stock erased its loss from the morning and ended with a gain of 5.3 percent following a report from Politico that Trump has told others that Musk will step back from his government role in coming weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 percent tax on imports from China, a 20 percent tax on imports from the European Union, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the companies whose shares fell in after-hours trading were Deckers Outdoor, the maker of Uggs, down 9.3 percent; Lululemon was down 8.8 percent; and home products retailer Williams-Sonoma was down 8.4 percent. (AP)

<img alt="All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records - it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798541_1_20250402064055.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday on a quiet trading day as investors braced for Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which he has dubbed "Liberation Day".
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has not unveiled the details of his plan, leaving traders guessing ahead of the announcement, which the White House has now penned for Wednesday at 4pm local time in Washington (2000 GMT), after Wall Street markets close.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1 percent to 41,989, while the broad-based S&P 500 shook off a recent slump to close up 0.4 percent at 5,633.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also finished in the green, gaining 0.9 percent to 17,449, a day after posting its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records, and it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce - that’s up from less than US$2,700 at the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In stocks, Tesla charged 3.6 percent higher a day ahead of reporting how many vehicles it delivered during the first three months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the losing end of Wall Street was Johnson & Johnson, which dropped 7.6 percent after a US bankruptcy court judge denied the company’s settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It’s the third time the company’s attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2 percent, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7 percent. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jane Street, one of the world's largest quant trading firms and market makers, is planning a sharp increase in Hong Kong office space, two people familiar with the matter said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York-based firm is negotiating with landlord Hongkong Land to lease two more floors at Chater House, an office tower in Central, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the deal materialises, Jane Street will occupy six floors of the 30-storey building, totalling over 110,000 sq ft of office space, compared to just two-and-a-half floors a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street and Hongkong Land declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising Sino-US tensions, China has regained popularity as an investment destination and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 15 percent in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Average daily turnover shot to US$28 billion for the first two months of the year, a 70 percent jump from the same time last year, data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citadel Securities and Tower Research Capital have also been recruiting and expanding their offices in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street employs 400 people in the city, one of the people said, adding that its Hong Kong-based team covers not just the mainland and Hong Kong but also Japan, Singapore and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hiring for more than 40 roles in Hong Kong, the firm's website shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for high-frequency trading and its dominance of the exchange traded funds market, Jane Street has seen explosive growth in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a registered market maker on the Hong Kong bourse and was approved to trade yuan-denominated shares in Hong Kong in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm earned around US$6.1 billion in the first half of last year, nearly double that of the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street plans to take the two floors used by Point72 Asset Management, according to one of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Point72 is moving out because it wants more office space, local media have said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla investors are bracing for a drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics exacerbates weakening demand for the electric vehicle maker's lineup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk promised Tesla would return to growth this year after its annual deliveries fell for the first time in 2024, and Wall Street will be watching to see how a refreshed Model Y SUV and incentives made a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has been grappling with rising global competition and mass protests against Musk's role overseeing cuts to federal spending as an adviser to US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said dismay at Musk's government cutbacks plus disdain towards his personal politics was affecting Tesla's business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's certainly has taken a toll on Tesla's stock [price] which rose sharply when Donald Trump won the election with Musk being his biggest financial backer. It hit a record of US$480 and today it's around US$259  ... with regard to sales one thing is quite clear: sales of new Tesla cars have slumped in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been offering discounts and other incentives, including low-cost financing, but these seemed to have had little impact in Europe, where sales declined in the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of China-made Teslas fell as well. Chinese rivals including BYD have ramped up a price war and launched at least six models in the past year to take on the Model Y. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 97.53 points, or 0.42 percent, to open at 23,217.11 points on Tuesday, as the market prepares for more news about US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day" and has pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, a private-sector survey has shown that mainland factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in March, buoyed by stronger demand and robust export orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.2 last month from 50.8 in February. That was higher than analyst expectations of 51.1. A number above 50 signals growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebound broadly aligned with an official PMI released on Monday that showed manufacturing activity growing at its quickest rate in a year. (with additional reporting by agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off some early gloom about Donald Trump's imminent tariff announcement to close mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 bouncing into positive territory from a six-month low.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day," and pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the uncertainty, volatility surged in early trading on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index, colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumping more than 10 percent before cooling sharply as the day progressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an earlier decline to close up 1.0 percent at 42,001.76, as did the broad-based S&P 500 Index, which gained 0.6 percent to 5,611.85.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.1 percent to 17,299.29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the resurgence, the S&P posted its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [traders] were taking advantage of an oversold situation," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They still have another day in which to sort of play around," before Trump's big tariff announcement, Stovall added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Moderna fell 8.9 percent after the departure of a top US Food and Drug Administration official who disagreed with Trump's new health secretary, noted vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (AFP)

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped by 13 percent year on year in February, partly due to high pre-festival spending from the Lunar New Year holiday falling in the same month last year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798288_1_20250331172638.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales suffered a notable decline last month, dropping by 13 percent year on year partially due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday showed that turnover of the city's total retail sales was provisionally estimated to be HK$29.4 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was significantly lower compared with HK$35.4 billion registered in January when sales dropped by 3.1 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking the first two months of the year together, the value retail sales were estimated to have decreased by 7.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volume of retail sales also notably declined, dropping by 15 percent, compared with the 5.1 percent retreat seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year, the total volume declined by 9.9 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the figures, a government spokesperson said the steep declines were partly due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in late January this year but in February last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumer spending in the local market normally attains a seasonal high before the festival," a government statement reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that when retail sales for the first two months of the year were bunched together, which could remove such a holiday effect, the decline was smaller compared with the drop in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the spokesperson acknowledged the challenges ahead but said various measures by the central and the SAR governments will offer support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government's proactive efforts to promote tourism and mega events, and the sustained increases in employment earnings in local labour market, would benefit the retail sector, though it would continue to face challenges from the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysed by categories, sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most significant decline – dropping by nearly 50 percent in the first two months of the year while that of furniture and fixtures decreased by 25.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, however, rose 0.7 percent year on year, followed closely by the 0.6 percent seen for medicines and cosmetics.

<img alt="Official data shows the purchasing managers' index for manufacturing was up 0.3 percentage points from February. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798209_1_20250331101633.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year in March, an official factory survey showed on Monday, in a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy as it deals with an escalating US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 50.5 in March versus 50.2 in February, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was the highest PMI reading since March 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, accelerated to 50.8 from 50.4.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at "around five percent", despite new tariffs from US President Donald Trump, which threaten to hit the massive export sector, a key driver for the US$18 trillion economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed a cumulative 20 percent tariff on all Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president is also preparing to announce "reciprocal" tariffs on Wednesday, a move designed to address trade imbalances, which could hit Chinese goods with additional levies. (Reuters)

<img alt="The fundraising will boost the ability of the banks to bolster the real economy. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798177_1_20250331072356.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four of the mainland's largest state-owned banks said on Sunday they plan to raise a combined 520 billion yuan (US$71.60 billion) in private placements from investors, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), after Beijing pledged to help them support the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fundraising, which aims to boost the banks' core tier-1 capital, comes after policymakers vowed earlier this month to recapitalise major state banks to the tune of 500 billion yuan to boost their ability to bolster the real economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of China said it aims to raise up to 165 billion yuan and China Construction Bank plans private placements of up to 105 billion yuan, filings released by the banks on Sunday said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Communications said it will sell shares of as much as 120 billion yuan, and Postal Savings Bank of China will raise up to 130 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry, a major shareholder of the four banks, will be involved in all four capital raises, the filings showed. The ministry is set to become the controlling shareholder for Bank of Communications following the share issue, the bank said in its filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four banks said that capital replenishment from the MOF is a crucial move from the government to support their stable operations and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry analysts said that the capital replenishment is a proactive measure that will strengthen the banks' capital foundations and optimise their capital structures.
  <br>
  <br>
  This move will enhance their operational resilience and risk management capabilities, enabling them to better serve the real economy and stabilise the financial system, according to analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has set its economic growth target for this year at roughly 5 percent, unchanged from last year, as the government pledged more fiscal resources to fend off deflationary pressures and offset the impact from US tariffs. (Xinhua, Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets plunged Friday as a closely watched US inflation reading heated up amid intensifying concerns over fallout from US President Donald Trump's incoming wave of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automakers fell further as they brace for 25 percent US tariffs due to kick in next week along with a raft of "reciprocal" surcharges tailored to different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market mood has soured over fears that Trump's plans will trigger tit-for-tat measures that would rekindle inflation, which could put the brakes on interest rate cuts and spark a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors remain nervous over the economic repercussions from President Trump's tariff threats, just days before he unleashes his 'reciprocal tariffs'" on April 2, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London just about held the line, closing barely off in the week's final session. But Paris, Frankfurt and Milan all slid around one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed sharply lower, with the Dow tumbling 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 losing 2.0 percent and Nasdaq diving 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide came after official data showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, remained unchanged last month at 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another key figure, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose more than expected at 2.8 percent in February on an annual basis, up from the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, automakers Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Peugeot and Fiat, fared particularly badly. Shares in General Motors and Ford also slumped on Wall Street. (AFP)

    MTR fares to freeze under adjustment mechanism

<img alt="While MTR fares will freeze for 2025-26, commuters could face a steep hike next year after 3.36 percent of adjustments are brought forward. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797892_1_20250328173801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

<img alt="The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has surpassed the record set last year by 70 percent. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797841_1_20250328124759.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Big swings in stock markets and hedge fund activity have propelled Hong Kong's derivative trading to unprecedented highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has reached 22 million so far this year, surpassing the record set in 2024 by 70 percent in less than three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts and investors attribute the sharp rise in the use of derivatives this year to the craze around Chinese technology firms and the growing use of hedging tools by long-short funds to navigate geopolitical and tariff uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has boosted its derivatives offering over the past six months to meet the market's growing demand as investors look to gain more exposure to Chinese assets in a way that helps lower their risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  New product launches have included Weekly Hang Seng Tech Index Options as well as weekly options for 10 individual stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Options, particularly those betting on large tech companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Xiaomi, have dominated the increase in trading, the analysts and investors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen meaningful pick-up in single stock options activities," said Jason Lui, head of APAC equity and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  By entering into call or put options contracts, investors make leveraged bets on the future price movements of the underlying assets but limit losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outsized gains in some very large companies have spurred investors to trade single stock options to maximise returns, Lui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's low-cost artificial intelligence reasoning model DeepSeek and President Xi Jinping's rare meeting with tech entrepreneurs have sent the Hang Seng Index up 17 percent this year. E-commerce giant Alibaba and smartphone and EV maker Xiaomi have surged 50 percent each to lead the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big stock swings often come with high volatility, posing particular risks to the Chinese market, which still faces tariff threats from US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Arete, a Hong Kong-based US$1 billion macro hedge fund, recently boosted its China equity exposure while staying hedged for potential market turbulence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the primary uncertainties we're trying to navigate is the US-China relationship and geopolitics broadly," said Yuexin Zeng, head of investor relations at Ocean Arete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volatility will "remain higher for longer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A volatility gauge tracking the Hang Seng Index hit a two-year high in October and rose again last month when the Hong Kong benchmark skyrocketed to a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hedge fund Aspoon Capital, which generated a 14 percent return in the first two months this year, is adding China tech index put options to hedge the tariff risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do think the market can be too complacent about the tariff now," Aspoon Chief Investment Officer Ryan Yin said in a newsletter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derivatives trading "absolutely has been strong in the last three to six months for China underlying [assets]," said Nick Silver, head of prime services for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have had to become much more familiar with trading in a choppy and sometimes downward trending market in recent years, he said, "and using derivatives is probably the best, most efficient way to do that." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Automakers were battered on Thursday as stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump announced significant tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, pressing ahead with tough trade policies many fear will spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, the Dow, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broad-based S&P 500 all slipped, with General Motors giving up 7.4 percent and Ford dipping 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Toyota - the world's top-selling carmaker - fell two percent. Honda shed 2.5 percent, Nissan was off 1.7 percent and Mazda dropped six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul-listed Hyundai gave up more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among European auto firms, Volkswagen shed 1.3 percent, Porsche lost 2.6 percent, Mercedes dropped 2.7 percent and BMW fell 2.5 percent, helping to push the Frankfurt DAX index down 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeep maker Stellantis lost more than four percent. India's Tata Motors, which exports Jaguars and Land Rovers to the United States, also lost ground - leading analysts to speculate on where markets may be headed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has escalated, and unsurprisingly, German carmakers are leading the declines or are among the biggest decliners today," said StoneX Group analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst with CMC Markets, added: "While investors see a fair chance for successful negotiations between the European Union and the US in the coming weeks, many prefer to wait for these discussions rather than speculate in advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States," Trump said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate, which takes effect on April 3 at 12:01 am affects foreign-made cars and light trucks imported into America. The tariffs also apply to auto parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of the cars sold in the United States are made within the country. Of the imported vehicles, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's government called the tariffs "extremely regrettable" while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a "direct attack" on his country's workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned: "The only solution for the European Union will be to raise tariffs on American products in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.4 percent to 42,299, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to 5,693. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.5 percent to 17,804. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's auto sector is expected to face "considerable difficulties" when US import tariffs on cars announced by President Donald Trump take effect and the government plans an emergency response by April, the industry minister said.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will also actively engage the US government to explore measures to minimise the negative impact on South Korea's auto companies and suppliers, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a meeting with industry officials on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Global uncertainties are growing but South Korean auto companies will not be fighting alone," Ahn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will consider financial assistance, investment support, and help with market diversification, he said, adding that parts suppliers are expected to be hit particularly hard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles sparked criticism and threats of retaliation from countries affected by the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in South Korea's Hyundai Motor shed more than 4 percent and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3 percent. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai together with affiliate Kia is the world's third-largest automaker by sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, South Korea's exports of automobiles to the United States stood at US$34.7 billion, accounting for 49 percent of its total auto exports. (Reuters)

<img alt='Irina Fan, director of research at the Trade Development Council, says the impact of US tariffs on Hong Kong is "relatively mild". File photo: RTHK' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797662_1_20250327132129.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Trade Development Council said Hong Kong exporters are well-prepared for the new round of US tariffs set to take effect on April 2.
 <br>
  <br>
  The council's export confidence index for the first quarter stood at 51, up 1.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The expectation index, which shows exporters’ expectations for the next quarter, also rose. It climbed one point to 51.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s
  <i>
   Backchat
  </i>
  programme on Thursday, the council’s director of research Irina Fan said the city’s export performance is driven by strong sales and procurement, as well as higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regarding the impact of US tariffs on local exports, Fan described it as “relatively mild” compared with some of Washington's major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Hong Kong's exporters are quite well-prepared for higher US tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our exporters took a very agile and flexible business strategy also actually in the past few years to mitigate the risk from higher US tariffs, which actually started in the year of 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  “They already adopted strategies like diversifying their sourcing, engaging with new partners and new markets, relocating some of their production lines, and also continuing to reduce their reliance, the selling to the US markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite trade tensions, Fan said 75 percent of exporters expect their profits to remain stable or grow, and that industries such as jewellery, equipment and materials, timepieces, electronics and toys remained positive in their outlook.

    'Art Basel, Art Central a barometer for art market'

<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Home prices drop to lowest level in nearly nine years

<img alt="Home prices continued to decline last month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797650_1_20250327120658.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices slumped for the third month in a row in February, dropping to their lowest level in almost nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Rating and Valuation Department on Thursday said prices fell almost 0.9 percent from the month before, following a decline of 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official home price index in February was at its lowest level since July 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents, meanwhile, were up 0.3 percent from January, reaching their highest level in five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at property consultancy firm CBRE Hong Kong, said the city's overall property prices were still "largely stable" and the latest declines were partially due to reduced transaction activities during the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects market sentiment to turn positive in the months ahead as the SAR government has reduced stamp duty to HK$100 for properties valued up to HK$4 million, adding that the stock market revival could also lend support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the residential property prices are bottoming out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as developers are pushing units to capture pent-up demand, it might be difficult for the residential market to record a strong rebound," he said, adding that price increases might only apply to newly built units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at property firm Colliers, said stamp duty adjustments could have weighed on home prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sellers and buyers have tried to push the selling price or purchase price to be below the HK$4 million threshold. That could also have had some impact on the price declines over the past month," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Lee forecast that prices will remain static in the first half of the year, she said there could be total growth of up to 0.5 percent by the end of the year if the US Federal Reserve reduces interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both Kwok and Lee said the rental market will remain strong, especially over the summer, because it will be boosted by demand from new arrivals to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, the increases of rental prices will not be to a great extent as there's also the affordability cap for new arrivals such as students," Lee said.

 Japan's government on Thursday warned of a "significant impact" on its economic ties with the United States -- and on global trade -- after US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo is a close economic and strategic US ally, with its firms the biggest investors in the United States and one in 10 Japanese jobs are connected to the auto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced on Wednesday 25 percent tariffs "on all cars that are not made in the United States" effective 12.01am eastern time on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who last month held friendly talks with Trump at the White House, said Japan was reviewing an "appropriate" response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan has made significant investments and significant job creation, which doesn't apply to all countries... we are the number one (country) in investment in the United States," Ishiba added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US president's understanding on this is significantly deepening. However, various things are happening, so we are considering all kinds of countermeasures," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi went further, calling the tariffs "extremely regrettable" and warning of major effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the US government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the US, as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system," Hayashi told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to this announcement, we have again told the US government that this measure was extremely regrettable and we strongly urged the US government to exclude Japan from the scope of this measure," Hayashi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement hammered carmakers in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's top-selling automaker Toyota at midday was down 2.7 percent, while Nissan shed 2.6 percent and Honda was off 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, Hyundai shares dipped 4.0 percent. (AFP)

 Asian shares mostly skidded with Wall Street on Thursday while the dollar hovered near a three-week high after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all auto imports, ratcheting up a global trade war that risks fuelling inflation.

    Canada PM dubs US auto tariffs 'direct attack'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks veered off course on Wednesday after the White House said President Donald Trump would announce fresh tariffs on the auto sector after markets close.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 percent at 42,454.79, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,712.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.0 percent to 17,899.01, while the CBOE Volatility Index -- Wall Street's so-called "fear gauge" -- jumped seven percent, reflecting market jitters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turn in market sentiment followed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks earlier Wednesday that Trump would unveil the "auto industry" tariffs at 4:00 pm (2000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the continuation of worries regarding the tariffs and the impact on the economy," Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital Securities told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is (also) waiting to see what the reciprocal tariffs are going to be on April the 2nd," he added. "So it's a continuation of this wall of worries."
  <br>
  <br>
  US automakers fell on the news, with Tesla closing down 5.6 percent.

  General Motors shed 3.1 percent, while Ford initially slipped, before reversing course to finish up 0.1 percent. (AFP)

    Trump announces 25pc tariff on non-US-built cars

<img alt="US President Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797599_1_20250327060802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman has told analysts on an earnings call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see "a substantial rise" in its market share in Britain, which is "very open" to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also sees "great opportunities" to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tuesday meeting, Wang also told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD's profits coming from overseas markets "at a certain stage".
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. (Reuters)

 Lingering hopes that US president Donald Trump's planned tariff blitz next week will not be as painful as feared lifted most Asian markets on Wednesday, though uncertainty about Trump's policies and the US economy tempered optimism.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ta Kung Pao newspaper on Wednesday renewed its criticism of the sale by CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial, Ta Kung Pao said there would be severe consequences if the conglomerate continues on this "wrong path".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the deal to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by the American firm BlackRock should not be considered a normal business decision on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also said the proposed sale undermined China's national interests.

    US stocks make minor gains on tariff hopes

<img alt="Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797399_1_20250326062321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly closed higher on Tuesday, building on earlier gains amid hopes that US President Donald Trump might take a narrower approach to upcoming tariffs than originally expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 42,587.50, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 5,776.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.5 percent to 18,271.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The absence of bad news is good news for stocks," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there has been "so much bad news" over the last few weeks that the respite on Tuesday allowed investors to breathe a sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, markets are waiting for further hints about Trump's upcoming tariff rollout, with the president having promised "reciprocal tariffs" tailored to each trading partner on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump earlier signaled that sector-specific levies hitting industries like automobiles and semiconductors could come around the same day, the White House said Monday that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March, the Conference Board said, with survey respondents flagging growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, new US home sales picked up slightly less than expected last month, with analysts warning that tariffs could raise costs for homebuilders -- weighing on the market subsequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting updates on US GDP data released Thursday, and the release of a key inflation gauge due Friday. (AFP)

    Boao forum offers upbeat forecast on Asia growth

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the forum was Chief Executive John Lee, who said Hong Kong is a global city connecting the world, and that the SAR will continue to promote free trade and market liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are devoted to deepening international exchange and collaboration. Hong Kong has signed investment agreements covering 33 economies, and free trade agreements covering 21 economies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aspire to add the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade pact – to our free trade agreements soon, and better contribute to regional cooperation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Equities diverged on Tuesday, as investors struggled to extend Wall Street's rally despite easing fears over US president Donald Trump's planned tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asian stocks fluctuated through the day, with Hong Kong sinking 2.3 percent to 23,344, weighed by a drop of around six percent in tech giant Xiaomi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi had raised US$5.5 billion in a mega share sale as it looked to expand its electric vehicle business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, which comes after a similar move this month by EV firm BYD, stoked worries about market liquidity. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A deputy at Beijing's top office on Hong Kong affairs has called on the SAR to roll out a blueprint to further drive its capital market development, seizing on opportunities brought about by the revitalisation of the city's stock market this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Tesla sales fall off a cliff in Europe

<div class="itemFullText">
 European sales of Tesla electric cars dropped 49 percent in January and February compared with the same period a year earlier, the ACEA manufacturers' association said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ageing models are one factor behind the plunge, but electric vehicle clients may also be refusing to buy in protest of Tesla's billionaire owner Elon Musk since he became a key supporter of US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has been leading a vocal and divisive cost-cutting drive at the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Tesla dealerships around the United States have been vandalised in recent weeks and the company's stock price has plummeted over the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year, giving the company a market share of just 1.1 percent, the ACEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February alone, Tesla registrations were down 47 percent at 11,743.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sales drop came even as overall electric vehicle sales jumped 28.4 percent over the first two months of this year to 255,489 – for an EU market share of 15.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries, "The latest new car registration figures confirm that market demand for battery electric vehicles remains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  She cited a need for tax and purchasing incentives for clients and investments in recharging stations, at a time when the EU is preparing to ease emission reduction targets for struggling European automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hybrid-electric vehicles continued to be the biggest market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations – for a 35.2 percent market share.
  <br>
  <br>
  That outpaced both petrol and diesel models, with market shares of 29.1 percent and 9.7 percent in February. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index lost 262.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to open at 23,643.32 on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that the US President Donald Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.

  April 2 is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of "reciprocal" measures -- imposing tariffs on other countries equal to those in place against the United States. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean auto giant Hyundai on Monday announced a multi-billion-dollar investment in the United States, including a new US$5.8 billion steel plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plant, which will be based in the US state of Louisiana, "will create 1,300 American jobs," Hyundai executive chairman Euisun Chung told reporters at a White House event alongside President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual capacity of 2.7 million tonnes, it is part of Hyundai's US$21 billion investment in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai's announcement makes it the latest firm to announce plans to invest billions of dollars into the United States since Trump's return to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has repeatedly threatened to impose painful tariffs on companies that do not relocate manufacturing jobs to the United States from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, domestic and foreign firms, including Apple and Oracle, have announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into US projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars are coming to this country at levels never seen before," Trump told reporters on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment was "a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hyundai will be producing steel in America and making its cars in America, and as a result, they'll not have to pay any tariffs," he added. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Monday as traders welcomed news that the administration of President Donald Trump may dial down upcoming tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told AFP the sector-specific levies "may or may not happen" as planned on April 2, adding that the situation was fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 percent to end trading at 42,583.32, and the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent to 5,767.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.3 percent to 18,188.59.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade news was "definitely the main cause" of the rise in Wall Street stocks, Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors clearly hate the idea of tariffs," he said. "So any news that implies that the burden of tariffs will be will be lighter than expected will be taken as a positive by the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Elon Musk's Tesla shot up 11.9 percent as traders piled back into the embattled stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  And United Airlines saw its share price jump 7.2 percent after announcing it was hiking fees on some credit cards and airline lounges. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<img alt="The benchmark Hang Seng Index was up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797176_1_20250324171443.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56 on a mixed day for equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.24 percent to end at 8,850.69, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.72 percent to end at 5,736.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equity markets were mixed as worries about fresh US tariffs pencilled in for next week were tempered by a report that Donald Trump was considering a more targeted approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has caused ructions on trading floors since resuming power in January by hitting out at long-standing allies and imposing or threatening swingeing tariffs on imports of an array of goods, including steel and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next Wednesday is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of reciprocal measures to counter those in other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anticipation and pre-positioning ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' on April 2 and the impending deluge of tariff-related announcements that will follow in the days/weeks after will be a growing factor that drives price action, sentiment and liquidity in markets this week," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the sky begins to bruise and darken, and the atmospheric pressure builds within the capital markets, market players question if it's time to batten down the hatches in preparation for a storm of uncertainty set to be unleashed on markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve last week warned that "uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased" while the central banks of Japan and Britain also warned about the impact of the White House's policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang said at the weekend that Beijing was readying for "shocks that exceed expectations" ahead of the latest measures, adding that "instability and uncertainty are on the upswing."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as he met heads of some of the world's biggest companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, FedEx and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was some hope among investors amid reports the US administration was considering a more targeted approach to the tariffs, with some countries being hit harder than others, and the measures not being as severe as initially feared.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after the president said on Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asian markets fluctuated through the day, with Tokyo falling along with Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai and Wellington joined Hong Kong in edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt opened on the front foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold held around US$3,025, having hit a series of records last week to a peak of more than $3,057 owing to a surge in demand for safe havens. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)
