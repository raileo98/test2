<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said market sentiment has improved due to declining interest rates and measures to stabilise the economy, despite slower economic growth in the third quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan noted increased transactions in both the stock and property markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect that Hong Kong's economy will continue to maintain momentum for the rest of this year, with the full-year economic growth projected to be close to the lower end of the original forecast range," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 1.8 percent in the three months ending September on a year-on-year basis, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a 3.3 percent growth in the April-to-June period. Officials are forecasting full-year growth of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will sign agreements with 17 more strategic enterprises – from the mainland, the US and Europe – on Monday to establish or expand their businesses here.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies are involved in fields such as AI, big data and new energy, and 90 percent of them plan to set up headquarters in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together with the first two batches of nearly 50 strategic enterprises, Chan said they will bring HK$42 billion in investment to Hong Kong and create more than 17,000 jobs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation rate slowed in October, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in October, down from 0.4 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as authorities on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to lift local government debt and boost spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, Beijing began unveiling fresh measures aimed at boosting economic activity,  including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher, with investors upbeat about the business agenda of President-elect Donald Trump. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778248_1_20241109060159.jpg&q=70">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished at fresh records on Friday, ending a buoyant week on a positive note prompted by relief at the swift resolution of the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 finished at 5,995.54, up 0.4 percent for the day and 4.7 percent for the week as markets welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's growth agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 43,988.99, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.1 percent to 19,286.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're in this honeymoon period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, which we saw in previous election cycles," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin thinks the strength in US equities could extend through the rest of 2024, but cautioned that worries about overvaluation will grow if the market keeps rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have greeted Trump's win in anticipation that tax cuts and regulatory relief will more than offset the ills of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appointees are also expected to permit more corporate dealmaking, boosting mergers and acquisitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday marked the debut in the Dow of chip company Nvidia, which declined 0.8 percent and paint company Sherwin-Williams, which rose 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbnb fell 8.7 percent after reporting earnings that narrowly missed analyst expectations. Briefing.com said "investments beyond the company's core markets are adding cost, casting a cloud on otherwise uplifting trends from the quarter." (AFP)

    HKMA cuts rates in response to Fed move

<img alt="The Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut a key rate in response to a US rate cut overnight. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778098_1_20241108091710.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday announced it had cut its base rate by 25 basis points to five percent with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The base rate is the benchmark for repo transactions under the discount window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said it cut the rate in response to an overnight cut in the US federal funds rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and the Bank of China said they would cut their best lending rates by a quarter of percentage point to 5.375 percent from Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, the US Federal Reserve announced a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point after policy-makers voted unanimously to lower the rate to between 4.50 and 4.75 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the HKMA said the pace of Fed rate cuts was still uncertain, posing a risk to global financial market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rate-cut cycle in the US is still at its initial stage. Interest rates might still remain at relatively high levels for some time. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," the authority said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Hong Kong dollar peg mechanism, interest rates move in lockstep with the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said Donald Trump's proposed economic policies might affect the Fed's moves to tamp down inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan includes tax cuts, tariffs and a mass deportation of illegal immigrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once Trump really starts to take office and begins to roll out his policies, that's the time when the market will begin to be more concerned with what will happen to the economy," Lau told an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will need at least three, six months before that will all come through. Of course, the worry is that rates might have to reverse course and go higher because of the worry about inflation, but that's more for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, meanwhile, said local housing prices may hit bottom by the end of this year, as the Fed continues its rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now with the rates gradually being lowered, we are expecting the market purchasing power to go up a little bit and to be unleashed gradually. I think the property prices would find bottom in the fourth quarter in 2024," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market sentiment for 2025 must be better than 2024 in order to support a rebound," Wong added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq powered to fresh records on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, extending a buoyant post-election rally.
 <br>
  <br>
  While the Dow finished essentially flat, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped to new all-time highs, with large tech companies like Facebook parent Meta and Apple surging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51 percent, to 19,269. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely unchanged at 43,729, but the S&P 500 gained 0.74 percent, to 5,973.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed shrugged off concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's election victory and moved ahead with a quarter point interest rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, noting there was still uncertainty about what President-elect Trump's actual economic agenda would be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices had earlier hit all-time highs on Wednesday as markets greeted Trump's election win in anticipation that tax cuts and the de-regulation would offset the impact of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were cheered by Powell's tone, which kept the door open to further interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, there's going to be a debate about the pace of rate cuts, but policy makers and chair Powell mentioned that they continue to think that policy is restrictive," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tech shares advanced, banking shares pulled back after a torrid session on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped 1.4 percent, while JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says he plans to serve out his full term. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778068_1_20241108051635.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that he would not resign if asked to leave early by President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference after unveiling a quarter point interest rate cut, Powell -- whose term as Fed chair ends in 2026 -- added that firing any of the Fed's seven governors was also "not permitted under the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments underscore the delicate balancing act policymakers may have to play in the next Trump administration, given the US president-elect's recent criticism of the Fed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused Powell -- whom he first appointed to run the US central bank -- of working to favour the Democrats, and has suggested he would look to replace him once his term as Fed Chair ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has also said he would like "at least" a say over setting Fed interest rates, something not currently allowed under the bank's dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed governors are nominated by the president, and appointed by the Senate to serve a 14-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can also be appointed to serve out the remainder of a 14-year term if a Fed governor retires, and must then be reconfirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  If he wanted to, Powell could stay on as a governor after he steps down as Fed chair, and serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in early 2028. (AFP)

<img alt="The Ontario-based company tempered its fiscal 2025 revenue expectations due to weak spending on luxury goods in the US. Photo" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778040_1_20241107214404.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada Goose Holdings posted a surprise quarterly profit and topped Wall Street estimates for revenue on Thursday, as the luxury parka maker benefits from a demand recovery in China, as well as its tight cost controls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its US-listed shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, as its robust performance in China contrasts with comments from bigger luxury brands such as Gucci-owner Kering and LVMH .
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue rose 2.5 percent in Greater China in the second quarter, Canada Goose said, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada Goose, whose parkas can retail for more than US$1,000, has also diversified by entering the non-winter category to include rain and warm weather clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding one-off items, Canada Goose posted a profit of 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with estimates for a loss of 5 Canadian cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 8 percent to C$162.5 million due to a cost-saving program that involved job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our second-quarter performance reflected steady progress across our operating priorities, as we navigated an increasingly challenging macro environment that affected consumer sentiment," CEO Dani Reiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Ontario-based company tempered its fiscal 2025 revenue expectations due to weak spending on luxury goods in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to range from a low-single-digit decline to a low-single-digit increase, compared to its previous forecast of low-single-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue in North America declined 3 percent in the reported quarter, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in the previous quarter.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday for only the second time since 2020 and said future reductions were likely to be gradual, as it saw higher inflation and economic growth after the new government's first budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, a stronger majority than expectations in a Reuters poll for a 7-2 vote in favour of a cut. Catherine Mann dissented, preferring to keep rates on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterling rose by almost half a cent against the US dollar immediately after the announcement. British government bond prices fell but quickly reversed that drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much," BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the economy evolves as we expect it's likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here," he added, broadly echoing his language after September's meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE predicted that finance minister Rachel Reeves' budget announced last week - which entails big increases in tax, spending and borrowing - would boost the size of Britain's economy by around 0.75 percent next year but barely improve annual growth rates in two or three years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her plan was likely to add just under half a percentage point to the rate of inflation at its peak in just over two years' time, the BoE said, causing inflation to take a year longer to return sustainably to its 2 percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves said families would welcome the BoE's rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE's cautious language on the future interest rate cuts was similar to previous months, in keeping with investors' view that it is likely to cut interest rates more slowly than the European Central Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE did not refer to Donald Trump's US election victory, which has prompted a big reduction in bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by quarter of a percentage point later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the BoE's rate cut, financial markets priced only around two interest rate cuts from the BoE in 2025 - compared with between two and three beforehand and down from around four before the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE said inflation was likely to rise to around 2.5 percent by the end of this year from 1.7 percent in September and hit 2.7 percent by the end of next year, before falling gradually below its 2 percent target by the end of the three-year forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government decisions to raise the cap on bus fares, hike value-added tax on private school fees and increase employers' social security contributions were likely to boost inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the latter measure combining with a 6.7 percent hike in the national minimum wage, the BoE said employers faced rising costs - although it could not be certain of the overall effect on inflation as employers might respond by sacking staff or accepting lower profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Britain's biggest businesses, BT and Sainsbury's, said on Thursday that tax changes in the budget would fuel inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE downgraded its forecast for average economic growth this year to 1 percent from 1.25 percent, reflecting recent revisions to past growth, it raised its forecast for 2025 to 1.5 percent from 1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This reflects the stronger, and relatively front-loaded, paths for government consumption and investment more than offsetting the impact on growth of higher taxes," the BoE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE's forecasts for growth and inflation include the impact of higher spending and taxes, they do not include the effect of a big rise in market borrowing costs since the budget as it set those assumptions beforehand and did not update them.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the now-higher market interest rates were factored in, the outlook for inflation and growth would likely be a bit lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE repeated its message that monetary policy would need to stay "restrictive for sufficiently long" to return inflation sustainably to the 2 percent target. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's leading chipmaker SMIC announced on Thursday a sharp rise in profits over the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  SMIC said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday that its third-quarter profit attributable to owners of the company stood at US$148.8 million, a jump of 58.3 percent compared to the equivalent period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said its revenue rose to nearly US$2.2 billion, a record high and the first time it had raked in over US$2 billion in a single quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results marked a return to form for the chipmaker after chalking up a nearly 60 percent year-on-year decline in profit in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it expected revenue growth to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, adding that it would "strengthen our confidence in development, maintain our strategic focus, stabilise our market share and consolidate our position in the industry". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports surged last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, easily topping forecasts and providing optimism about the economy as officials steel for a potential trade war with the United States after Donald Trump was re-elected president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 12.7 percent in October from a year earlier to US$309.1 billion, according to customs data released on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is the best since July 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports to the US rose 8.1 percent while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months," Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports, meanwhile, fell 2.3 percent, turning negative for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$95.7 billion in October, up from US$81.7 billion in September. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to all-time records on Wednesday in a torrid post-election rally that cheered Donald Trump's growth agenda and welcomed the presidential race's swift conclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished at all time-highs, led by the Dow Jones, which piled on 3.6 percent at 43,729.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 2.5 percent to 5,929, while the Nasdaq jumped 3.0 percent to 18,983.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets expect passage of Trump's agenda based on Republican wins in the Senate and anticipation that his party will retain the House as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally translated into particularly robust gains for financial and industrial companies, as well as for private prison stocks. Renewable energy companies were among the losers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reaction today is just the fact that it was a clean sweep ... winning the election, the electoral vote, the popular vote, the Senate, and looking like they'll retain the House as well," said Aaron Clark, equity portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. "The market's clearly on a sugar high."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains showed investor hopes about expected tax cuts and regulatory easing more than offset worries about higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A swift and decisive outcome reduces the risks of protracted uncertainty, political violence, recession risks, and even geopolitical spillover that could have accompanied presidential election outcome uncertainty," said Prestige Economics' Jason Schenker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big winners in the post-election rally included Trump Media & Technology Group, home to the president-elect's Truth Social platform, as well as Tesla, which is led by Trump mega-supporter Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Media rose 5.9 percent and Tesla piled on 14.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big financial companies also soared in expectation of an easing in strict banking rules. JPMorgan Chase won 11.6 percent and Goldman Sachs soared 13.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  CoreCivic and GEO Group, which manage immigration detention centres, both jumped on expectations of more investment. CoreCivic won nearly 29 percent while GEO Group won more than 42 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But renewable energy producers and other companies focused on sustainability were under pressure. This group included Enphase Energy, down 16.8 percent, and First Solar, down 10.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and mainland shares fell while US stock futures rose sharply hours before the opening of markets on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the American presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The greenback surged and bitcoin hit a record high, with traders ramping up bets on fresh tax cuts, tariffs and rising inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index snapped a three-day winning streak, finishing 468 points or 2.2 percent lower at 20,538.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland stocks also closed lower, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.09 percent to 3,383 and the Shenzhen Component Index losing 0.35 percent at 10,968.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the prospect of another Trump presidency and Republican control of US Congress risked heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we’ve seen between 2016-20 other levers that can be pulled to contain China," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments.

  "Although both candidates are probably hawkish toward China, Trump is still less predictable in terms of policy, so the prospect of a Trump win could still drag sentiment a bit," said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International.

  <br>
  Stock futures were up 2.2 percent for the Dow, 2 percent for the broad-based S&P 500 and 1.7 percent for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US dollar jumped 1.5 percent to 154.38 yen, its highest since July, while it was also up more than 1 percent against the euro and more than 3 percent against the Mexican peso.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offshore yuan fell more than 1 percent versus the greenback, to its weakest since mid-August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin sprung US$6,000 higher to a record US$75,371.69, topping its previous peak of US$73,797.98 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world" and to put tech billionaire Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The price of bitcoin has closely followed Trump's position in the polls and on betting markets," Russ Mould, an analyst at AJ Bell, said ahead of Tuesday's US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are "potentially taking the view that a Republican victory would lead to a surge in demand for the digital currency", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Esho, economist and founder at Esho Capital, said: "The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, bouncing back from the prior session's declines in a benign session held as voters went to the polls in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters have for weeks pointed to a neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the market is saying is that the economy has continued to hold up even in the face of all this uncertainty that we have," said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, who pointed to a host of potentially market-moving policy areas affected by the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 1.0 percent at 42,221.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to 5,782, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 18,439.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 pushed higher, led by consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology equities also advanced, including Netflix, which won 1.1 percent despite a raid of the company's offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday as part of a tax fraud probe, according to a judicial source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing dropped 2.6 percent as a machinist union voted to accept the company's latest contract offer, ending a more than seven week strike that closed two assembly plants in the Seattle area. The new contract includes a 38 percent wage hike. (AFP)

 Local stocks on Tuesday overcame early losses to finish more than 2 percent higher, thanks partly to fresh confidence towards the Chinese economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index gained 439 points to 21,006, its highest finish in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most blue chips and tech plays closed higher.

  <br>
  Mainland stocks also did well, finishing at four-week highs, after Premier Li Qiang expressed confidence in the country's economic recovery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed slightly lower after a choppy session on Monday, as investors prepared for a crucial week in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve will release a policy statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both scrambled for an edge in the last full day of a race that polls show as extremely close. It could take days to determine the victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the so-called "Trump trades" unwound after a recent poll showed Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading in Iowa, sparking a drop in the US dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin. Trump Media & Technology Group closed up 12.4 percent, bouncing back from early losses of nearly 6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, to 41,794, the S&P 500 lost 16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,712 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,179.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were largely pricing in a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points at its policy announcement on Thursday, with CME's FedWatch Tool showing markets pricing in a 98 percent chance of a cut, with only a 2 percent chance the central bank keeps rates steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors was energy, up 1.9 percent as oil prices climbed after OPEC+ decided to delay plans for an output increase. (Reuters)

    Exchange Fund sees record income for first nine months

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

    Nvidia to join key US stock index

<img alt="Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180 percent this year. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777296_1_20241102102833.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chip giant Nvidia will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Wall Street index announced on Friday, underscoring the importance of artificial intelligence in the US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The addition of Nvidia, which will take effect on November 8, also marks a historic moment for the semiconductor industry, as the AI chip leader replaces struggling rival Intel, which has been a Dow constituent since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P Dow Jones Indices, the company that runs the index, also said it would add paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams, replacing chemical giant Dow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180 percent this year as tech giants clamour for its powerful and high cost processors that power generative AI, the technology that is widely seen as the next phase of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel, one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, has seen its shares fall 50 percent so far this year as the company struggles to meet the AI boom.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is often used as a bellwether for the state of the US stock market, the biggest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the S&P500 that weighs companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more influence on its movements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce and Cisco Systems are currently in the index, while Google, Amazon and Meta are not. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Friday from mixed tech earnings and investor jitters less than a week before a neck-and-neck US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  After major indices tumbled on Thursday following big drops in Microsoft and Meta, buoyant results from Amazon helped boost the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors also took the bright side of a weak employment report that showed the US economy added just 12,000 jobs last month, far below expectations in a report that was temporarily distorted by major hurricanes and the Boeing strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on the positive side, the report bolstered the chance that the Fed will reduce interest rates again next week. Futures markets overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices advanced, led by the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 percent at 42,052.19, the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 5,728.80 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 percent to 18,239.92.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon report "countered some of the negativity that was building yesterday on the mega-cap" stocks, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts expect cautious trading early next week ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday, with the result possibly delayed for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices gained following reports that Iran was planning a major retaliatory strike on Israel, reviving the market's geopolitical fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expectations of a major rate cut by the Fed, like the bumper 50 basis point cut in September, have receded after data showed strong economic growth in the United States and inflation just above the central bank's long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the "lower-than-expected jobs creation could prompt the Fed to follow through with the widely anticipated 25 basis point cut following their next meeting later next week," said Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS brokerage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst with eToro, said the October jobs numbers "should keep a December rate cut on the table, too." (AFP)

    Retail sales drop 6.9 percent in September

<img alt="The government says a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777220_1_20241101165645.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales were down 6.9 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data released on Friday showed that the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop followed a revised 10 percent fall in August and an 11.7 percent decrease in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic fall, with a 26.7 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures, and a possible easing of the Hong Kong dollar alongside the US dollar with the commencement of the US interest rate cut, would be conducive to boosting sentiment and supporting spending," a government spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the sector is pessimistic about sales for the rest of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's anticipated that many local people will travel abroad during the Christmas period, and certain domestic-related retail categories are expected to see a decline in business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the absence of Christmas holidays on the mainland, the tourist-related retail categories, such as watches and jewellery, are also expected to perform worse than last year."

    Hong Kong to relaunch Islamic finance drive: Paul Chan
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is ready to relaunch its drive to develop Islamic finance, after a three-day trip to the Saudi capital Riyadh opened his eyes to the untapped potential of developing more financial products that comply with Islamic law.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the visit, the Hong Kong delegation led by the finance chief signed 10 memoranda of understanding to further cooperation between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreements covered areas from mutual investment to collaborations in technology and innovation development, while a local tech firm signed on to launch insurance products with two Saudi companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday to conclude his visit, Chan said his exchanges made it apparent that Saudi Arabia is more interested in the Hong Kong, mainland and Asian markets than he had previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he came to understand that the kingdom wants to attract different sources of funding to support its infrastructure and industrial development, and hence there’s a demand for diverse forms of financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, we thought that market demand for Islamic finance wasn't that high. But after talking to them, we think we'll relaunch Islamic finance soon," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to do a lot of infrastructure work. During our exchanges with them, we discussed Islamic finance, as well as using funds raised from issuing green and sustainable bonds in the Hong Kong bond market to support them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamic finance involves business transactions that are in full compliance with Islamic law – and which prohibits any involvement with, for example, gambling, alcohol and pork, while interest payments are also banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also revealed that the Future Investment Initiative, or FII Institute, is eager to stage the FII Priority Summit in Hong Kong again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Saudi Arabia is very interested in research and development of technologies, and welcomes SAR companies to set up shop in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia found that it is worth taking reference to Hong Kong's way of nurturing start-ups and talent, according to Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They think that our way of nurturing talent through two parks and offering funds to support them, or even the tailor-made listing regime that allows start-ups without profits and income to be listed, is very worth taking reference to."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for nurturing talent, their insurance authority recently went to Hong Kong for an exchange with the local authority. They want to send someone to Hong Kong on secondment, so as to introduce some of our practice to the country. I think this is a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there was no need to adjust Hong Kong’s full-year economic growth forecast, even though the city’s third quarter growth has slowed to 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the announcement of the Financial Budget at the beginning of this year, we expected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent. I think that the growth could still be within this range. Therefore there's no need to adjust it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will remain both cautious and optimistic.

    Boeing sweetens offer for striking workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 US aviation giant Boeing has improved the conditions in its contract offer to thousands of striking workers, with a 38 percent wage increase over four years and a ratification bonus, their union said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, which represents more than 33,000 workers who went on strike on September 13 in the Seattle area, has endorsed the contract, and scheduled a vote on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your union is endorsing and recommending the latest IAM/Boeing contract proposal. It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory," the IAM chapter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members overwhelmingly rejected an offer of a 25 percent raise over four years on September 12. A second offer, which promised a 35 percent pay rise, was rejected by nearly two-thirds of members last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union has consistently asked for a 40 percent salary increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success," the union said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the 38 percent wage increase, members will be entitled to a US$12,000 ratification bonus, up from US$7,000 in the previous offer, Boeing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4," Boeing said in a statement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Major US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday after Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks also slipped. Amazon and Apple dropped ahead of their quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet, which reported on Tuesday, also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You had three of the Magnificent Seven all say they basically have open-ended budgets for AI spend and investors don't like to hear that," said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The intermediate and longer-term implications of this buildout are really important for US long-term growth and long-term productivity. ... In the short run, investors are asking where's the profit from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft and Meta both said their capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could reduce profitability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell 0.9 percent, to finish at 41,763. The S&P lost 1.9 percent, to 5,705, and the Nasdaq fell 2.8 percent, to 18,095.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2 percent in September, in line with economists' expectations. However, the core figure was 2.7 percent year-over-year, slightly above the 2.6 percent forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 25-basis-point rate reduction in the Fed's November meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do expect them to cut by a quarter (percentage point) next week because there is nothing in the data this week that should throw them off of that," Schleif said. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong's economy grew by 1.8 percent in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Growth was slower than the previous two quarters – the second quarter saw a 3.2 percent expansion and first quarter GDP grew by 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said growth in exports was down, while private consumption expenditure continued to decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the local economy will continue to grow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While global economic uncertainties and trade conflicts may affect Hong Kong's exports of goods, monetary easing across major central banks and an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures would help support sentiment and activities in the domestic market," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had projected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tse, an economist at DBS Bank, said he expects the economy to improve in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the economy hasn't been doing well in the past few quarters. But I think for the fourth quarter, it will be doing a little bit better, given the interest rate cut cycle from the Fed (US Federal Reserve) has already commenced. Mainland China has also started their stimulus packages," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, these will be translating into some positive effects onto the consumption as well as the investment."

 A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Bank of Japan warns of 'high uncertainties'

<img alt="For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1777014_1_20241031144239.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
  <br>
  <br>
  For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Wednesday despite positive US economic data, as investors assessed company earnings including reports after the bell by major tech names Facebook-parent Meta and Microsoft.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones retreated 0.2 percent to 42,141, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.3 percent to 5,813.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq lost 0.6 percent to 18,607.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be searching for a "next catalyst" to determine if it can keep moving higher, said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, he added, "Alphabet is doing very well on the back of its earnings report. But at the same time, you have some other earnings results that were not received quite as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed 2.9 percent higher, a day after it reported solid third quarter results with revenue climbing 15 percent from a year ago to US$88.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other companies saw their share prices drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, lost 2.1 percent as it reported a drop in sales and lowered its revenue outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.6 percent although its results came in slightly above expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In after-hours trading, Meta shares fell more than two percent shortly after reporting profits that surpassed market expectations, while Microsoft gained 0.8 percent on strong growth in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of Wall Street came despite the US economy expanding 2.8 percent in the third quarter according to government data.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a solid figure although a slight slowdown from the previous quarter. Data from payroll firm ADP also showed private sector hiring surged more than expected. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
 <br>
  <br>
  The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the debut of Saudi Arabia's first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Hong Kong-listed equities will strengthen cooperation between the two places.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's remark came as trading of such ETFs began on the Saudi stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Issuer Albilad Capital and its partner CSOP Asset Management said the trading of the product raised more than US$1.2 billion at the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Riyadh after the listing ceremony, Chan said the ETFs open doors for Middle Eastern investors to capital markets beyond the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Middle Eastern investors can gain easy access to our Hong Kong markets. However, this investment extends beyond just Hong Kong. As you know, more than 70 percent of the market value of listed companies in Hong Kong comes from the mainland. Therefore, investing in the Hong Kong market is equivalent to investing in key sectors of the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia's first ETF covering Saudi Arabian stocks made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last November. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s stock market operator on Wednesday said it will open an office in Riyadh next year, boosting its global coverage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said the new office in the Saudi Arabian capital would help investors in the Middle East better access financial products and capital markets in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its CEO Bonnie Chan pointed out that the Riyadh branch will join HKEX’s other offices in Beijing, Shanghai, London, New York, and Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The new Riyadh office will enable us to foster greater global coverage and facilitate access for Middle East clients to Asia’s most international, diverse and liquid capital markets in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the trading of Saudi Arabia’s first exchange-traded fund that tracks Hong Kong-listed shares kicked off.

 There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between Beijing and Riyadh.

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent

<img alt="China-made Teslas will be taxed an addition 7.8 percent, Chinese car giant Geely faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776781_1_20241030075912.jpg&q=30">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said China "does not approve of or accept" the move, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ministry spokesperson added that Beijing has already appealed to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq pushed to a record high on Tuesday despite a pullback in the Dow, as markets greeted a series of earnings from technology heavyweights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Google parent Alphabet rose in after-hours trading following its earnings report, which will be succeeded later this week by releases from Apple, Microsoft and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tech stocks are catching a bid," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that there has been "more good news than bad" today.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.8 percent at 18,712,
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones declined 0.4 percent to 42,233, while the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent at 5,832.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan pointed to another decline in oil prices as supportive of stocks and noted that US Treasury bond yields were stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month, another positive for stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Ford fell 8.4 percent after reporting solid third-quarter earnings, but lowering some of its full-year projections, implying a weaker fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing shot up 1.5 percent after it announced it will raise more than initially expected from a new stock offering as it seeks to offset crushing production woes and a major strike. The aerospace giant now expects to raise at least US$21 billion from the campaign. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings posted a 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as its wealth and wholesale banking benefited from slower-than-expected rate cuts while it embarks on one of the largest overhauls in its history.
 <br>
  <br>
  Europe's largest bank posted pretax profit of US$8.5 billion for the July-to-September period versus US$7.7 billion a year earlier. The result compared with a US$7.6 billion mean average of broker estimates compiled by HSBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London-headquartered, Asia-focused bank also announced an additional share buyback of up to US$3 billion, on top of a US$6 billion buyback programme announced earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lender unveiled a roadmap for its sweeping restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery designed to control costs and improve efficiency. HSBC announced last week that it will merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into East and West, under a new leadership structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will begin to implement these plans immediately," Elhedery said in an earnings statement, but further details will be disclosed in February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC kept its 2024 and 2025 near-term return on tangible equity goal – a performance target – at mid-teens for two years but said in the statement that the "the outlook for interest rates has changed, and been volatile". (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks climbed on Monday at the start of a heavy week of earnings and economic data, while markets also monitor the finale of the US presidential campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to a pullback in oil prices as supportive of equities even though US Treasury yields pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a continuation of good economic news," said Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer of FNBO, pointing to broadly higher earnings so far and expectations for additional easing of US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.7 percent at 42,387.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 4,823.52, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 0.3 percent to 18,567.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are eyeing the earnings reports of major tech companies this week including Apple, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others reporting results include McDonald's, ExxonMobil and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US government will also be releasing its third quarter GDP growth estimate this week, as well as its monthly labour market report -- closely watched for its bearing on the central bank's interest rate policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, aviation giant Boeing, which announced a stock offering that is expected to raise up to $19 billion, saw its shares slide 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing last week reported a major quarterly loss and has been reeling from a workers' strike. (AFP)

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
 <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

<img alt="Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends a signing ceremony for an agreement between Vale and BHP and Brazilian authorities. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776399_1_20241027084829.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  BHP denies responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 600 people were left homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
  <br>
  <br>
  BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

    Russia hikes interest rates to 21%, highest since 2003

<img alt="The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776235_1_20241025202739.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Apple is welcome to deepen its presence in China in talks with the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cook, for his part, pledged to increase investment in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  At their meeting in Beijing on Friday, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Apple's business in China as well as China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing is willing to help return bilateral economic and trade ties to a healthy and stable track through regular exchanges between government officials and firms, and provide quality services for foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will further optimise its business environment and continue to provide high-quality services for foreign-funded firms," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that Apple is welcome to maintain stable cooperation with Chinese partners to achieve common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cook said China's rapid development helps Apple achieve fast and sustainable growth, and the company will continue to serve as a bridge between Beijing and Washington in economic and trade issues. (Xinhua and agencies)

 Hong Kong stocks opened higher on Friday, following overnight gains in US markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rose 32.33 points, or 0.16 percent, to open at 20,521.95.
  <br>

  Earlier, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&P 500 closed higher, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower.

  The Dow fell by 140.59 points, or 0.33 percent, to 42,374.36. The S&P 500 added 12.44 points, or 0.21 percent, to 5,809.86, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 138.83 points, or 0.76 percent, to 18,415.49. (Xinhua)
