<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

    US markets fall after jobs figures feed rate worries

<img alt="Wall Street finished lower, amid fears that strong jobs growth will feed inflationary pressures. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787052_1_20250111070945.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Friday, after a strong employment report fuelled expectations the central bank might make fewer interest rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 percent to 41,938.45, and the S&P 500 Index fell 1.5 percent to 5,827.04.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.6 percent to 19,161.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide across major indexes came after a Department of Labor report showed the world's biggest economy adding 256,000 jobs in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  This defied expectations of a slowdown in job growth, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 percent as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shot up, before moderating its gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors took the better-than-expected labour market figures "as a sign" that the Federal Reserve would be slower in reducing interest rates, said Sam Stovall of CFRA.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Fed has started cutting rates last year, after the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers have been balancing this with progress in lowering inflation sustainably.
  <br>
  <br>
  "January will continue to be a volatile month," Stovall said, citing interest rate worries and traders' focus on earnings reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market sees a 97 percent chance that the Fed holds rates steady at its next policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Apple shed 2.4 percent and Nvidia shares fell 3.0 percent. (AFP)

    US hiring beats expectations, unemployment edges down

<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains soared past expectations in December, according to government data released on Friday, in a sign that the labour market remains healthy just shortly before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hiring in the world's biggest economy was 256,000 last month, up from a revised 212,000 in November, said the Labour Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate crept down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest report marks a solid end to 2024 for the jobs market, which has held up in the face of elevated interest rates, allowing consumers to continue spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's return to the White House this month could bring uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to raise tariffs on imports and deport undocumented immigrants – many of whom are a part of the US labour force including in areas like agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, average hourly earnings picked up 0.3 percent from the month before to US$35.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, wages were up 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour market resilience and continued wage growth support consumption, a key driver of the US economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles jumped more than 40 percent in China last year, as demand for new energy models continues to surge and the sector remains entrenched in a gruelling price war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle market has witnessed explosive growth in recent years, driven in part by subsidies from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the world's largest automotive market has also seen fierce competition among domestic car manufacturers as a consumption slowdown fuels a price war that is weighing on profitability
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, almost 11 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) were sold, a year-on-year increase of 40.7 percent, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NEVs accounted for nearly half - 47.6 percent - of all retail sales last year, the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, such vehicles accounted for just 22.6 percent of sales in the European market in November, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In China, NEV sales surpassed 1.3 million units in December, CPCA data showed, up 37.5 percent year-on-year and representing the fifth consecutive month of sales of more than one million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond just NEVs, the total number of vehicles sold last year in the Chinese market swelled 5.5 percent, reaching nearly 22.9 million units, the CPCA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For EV companies, the price war is likely to carry on in the new year, CPCA secretary general Cui Dongshu said during a Thursday press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 200 car models saw price cuts last year, compared to 148 in 2023, Cui added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged as a clear leader in the Chinese market. The Shenzhen-based firm sold more than four million vehicles globally in 2024. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said on Thursday that it expects its air ticket fares to continue to "normalise" this year, as the group's passenger capacity returns to pre-pandemic levels from this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Attending an online briefing, Lavinia Lau, the group's chief customer and commercial officer, noted that while fares for short-haul flights have already largely returned to pre-Covid levels, ticket prices for long-haul flights remain high due to robust demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because of the supply-demand imbalance primarily between China and the US. Some of the direct flights [between the two countries] have not resumed. That's why a lot of passengers still transited via Hong Kong to get on our US flights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do expect as we continue to add more and more flights, there'll likely be continued normalisation of yields," Lau said, adding that the group has hired over 7,000 new staff last year to cope with the rising demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Rebecca Sharpe, the group's chief financial officer, noted that the company has seen solid growth in its cargo business last year, thanks to a surge in e-commerce shipments from the mainland to long-haul destinations like the US and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she warned that there could be a drop in demand going forward, and the company will closely monitor the tariff risks from the US going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, she said the group is expecting strong financial results in the second half of this year, driven by its cargo business and fuel price declines.

    More tax concessions needed despite budget deficit: EY

<img alt="Paul Ho (left) says the estimated budget deficit would be around HK$98 billion for this financial year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786813_1_20250109165740.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consulting firm EY on Thursday called on the government to roll out more tax concessions, although it expected the budget deficit would double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm estimated that Hong Kong’s budget deficit would be HK$98 billion, while accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecast the gap at HK$95 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, government officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  EY noted that governemnt revenue from land premiums and stamp duty fell short of expectations, despite the easing of property cooling measures last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the consultancy's financial services tax leader for Hong Kong, Paul Ho, said authorities should cut tax for real estate investors and commodity traders to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Providing those concessions will actually attract more businesses and investors and capital to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tax concessions or some kind of tax measures that could benefit and attract investors will actually overall help the growth of the Hong Kong economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  PwC also called for similar moves, suggesting the government reduce tax for research and development activities in the Greater Bay Area.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 0.2 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was in line with the previous year's pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer inflation rose 0.1 percent last month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, slower than the 0.2 percent gain in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's growth was the weakest since April 2024, however it matched forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory deflation, meanwhile, extended to a 27th month, although the producer price index recorded a slower decline of 2.3 percent year on year in December, compared with a 2.5 percent fall in November. Analysts had expected a 2.4 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing aims to boost consumption and domestic demand this year, and has pledged to adopt a "moderately loose" monetary policy with greater fiscal support to prop up growth in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Wall Street logged modest gains on Wednesday as investors awaited a government employment report due this week while assessing the prospect of further interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones added 0.3 percent to 42,635, while the S&P 500 picked up by 0.2 percent to 5,918.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq lost 0.1 percent to 19,478.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been up and down most of the day," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the biggest of the headwinds thus far this week has been the surge in yields in the Treasury market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's recent policy meeting showed that several officials raised concerns the fight against inflation may have stalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it very much corroborated the idea that the Fed is willing to take some time before they cut rates again," Hogan noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market is closed on Thursday to mark the death of former US president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, traders will be eyeing the first government jobs report released this year, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US private sector added fewer jobs than expected in December according to payroll firm ADP, with employment rising by 122,000 jobs, down from 146,000 in November. (AFP)

<img alt="Meta's move is seen as bowing to criticism from conservatives as US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786576_1_20250108090923.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Meta's shock announcement that it is ending its US fact-checking program triggered scathing criticism on Tuesday from disinformation researchers who warned it risked opening the floodgates for false narratives.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was going to "get rid" of its third-party fact-checkers in the United States, in a sweeping policy shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever," said Ross Burley, co-founder of the non-profit Centre for Information Resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an alternative, Zuckerberg said Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, would use "Community Notes similar to X" in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Community Notes is a crowd-sourced moderation tool that X has promoted as the way for users to add context to posts, but researchers have repeatedly questioned its effectiveness in combating falsehoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's announcement was cheered by conservative supporters of US President-elect Donald Trump, who said the move had "probably" been in response to his threats against the company and Zuckerberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta began fact checks in December 2016, after Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that “fake news” was spreading on its platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years, the tech giant boasted it was working with more than 100 organisations in over 60 languages to combat misinformation. (Agencies)

<img alt="While the three major indices fell, yields on US Treasurys rose. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786557_1_20250108071511.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as traders digested economic data which lowered the likelihood of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Services sector and job openings data pointed to price pressures and a relatively robust labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the Fed's dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, Tuesday's data suggest there is no burning need to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have some relatively minor numbers today, but they pointed to things that are not at all Fed friendly: higher prices and a more robust labour economy," said Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones faired best of the three major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.4 percent at 42,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,909, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.9 percent to close at 19,489.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the stock markets fell, yields on US Treasurys rose, with the yield on the popular 10-year US Treasury rising by six basis points to around 4.7 percent on growing fears that President-elect Trump's threats to impose tariffs could prove inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 24 hours, futures traders have raised their expectations that the Fed will pause interest rate cuts at its next rate meeting this month, according to data from CME Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, chip titan Nvidia plunged 6.2 percent after chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote address at a tech conference failed to impress investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was good news for pharmaceutical giant Moderna, which jumped 11.7 percent as flu and Covid-19 cases continued to rise across the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are now looking ahead to the release of job data on Wednesday and Friday of this week, which will provide key information on the overall health of the labour market. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 3,600 global finance and business figures will attend the annual Asian Financial Forum (AFF) which is set to kick off in Hong Kong next Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee; Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank; and Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on artificial intelligence will be among the speakers for the event, touching on the shifting global economic landscape and its impact on mainland China, as well as the development and governance of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 18th edition of the forum is "Powering the Next Growth Engine".
  <br>
  <br>
  While AI is expected to be a key focus, Patrick Lau, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council, told RTHK that the event will also explore other fields that are considered as new drivers for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing family offices and wealth management, together with philanthropy, as another area of high growth, especially leveraging in Hong Kong's strength as an international financial centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green and sustainability will continue to be very important going forward. Last but not least, we have many new friends in Asean and the Middle East, so Islamic finance is another big area [in focus] for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the SAR's financial markets have undergone a series of reforms, including a road map on sustainability disclosure and a policy statement on responsible application of AI in the financial markets, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the forum will showcase the SAR's latest financial advantages while exploring new collaborations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luanne Lim, chairwoman of the AFF Steering Committee and Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of HSBC, said despite greater uncertainties this year with increased tariff risks, Asia will continue to be the global growth engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The region's gross domestic product is expected to grow 4.4 percent this year, outpacing the 2.7 percent global average target.

    'Putting Tencent, CATL on US list is suppression'

<img alt="The US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery maker CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786435_1_20250107115416.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of "unjustified suppression" after the US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery manufacturer CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is always firmly opposed to the US side's generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the curbing of China's high-quality development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrong practices," Guo said, adding China would "take the necessary measures to resolutely protect the rights of Chinese companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless, drone maker Autel Robotics, and China's largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, according to a document published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two entities owned by Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation were also listed, CNOOC China Ltd and CNOOC International Trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under US law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to US entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could also add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent fell as much as seven percent in early trade on Tuesday, while the US-traded shares of the company, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell eight percent in over-the-counter trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker whose Shenzhen-listed shares dropped more than five percent, also called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military-related activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error." Quectel's shares fell nearly seven percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cosco's HK-listed shares dropped more than four percent. (Agencies)

 Tech sector gains helped US indexes recoup some holiday-season losses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 32.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,975.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 42,706.56, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 243.30, or 1.2 percent, to 19,864.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies were the clear leaders, including those with A-I exposure. Nvidia climbed 3.4 percent to top its record set in November ahead of a speech by CEO Jensen Huang at the annual CES convention in Las Vegas after trading ended for the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing despite criticism that they're overbought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith said on late Friday the company is on track to invest about US$80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centres to train AI models this fiscal year. Smith said AI is the biggest opportunity “to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy” since the invention of electricity. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uber Technologies rose 2.7 percent higher after the ride-hailing app said it would accelerate US$1.5 billion in purchases of its own stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Steel climbed 8.1 percent after it and Japan’s Nippon Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. (AP)

<img alt="US and Nippon Steel are mounting a legal challenge against President Joe Biden's decision to block the deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786361_1_20250106211435.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nippon Steel and US Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based American steel maker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit, filed on Monday in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the outset of the process, both Nippon Steel and US Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security, including by revitalising communities that rely on American steel, bolstering the American steel supply chain, and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry," the companies said in a prepared statement Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had promised to invest US$2.7 billion in US Steel’s ageing blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting US government approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While administration officials have said the decision was unrelated to Japan's relationship with the US — this is the first time a US president has blocked a merger between a US and Japanese firm. (AP)

    XPeng seals new partnership deal with Volkswagen

<img alt="Shares of XPeng jumped nearly five percent in early trading in Hong Kong. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786298_1_20250106141139.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Chinese EV maker XPeng jumped sharply after the company announced an expanded strategic partnership with German automaker Volkswagen to build the largest electric vehicle supercharging network in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), under which the two parties will open up their respective fast-charging networks to each other's customers, and work together to build a ultra-fast charging network in the country that comprises over 20,000 charging terminals covering 420 cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of XPeng Motors jumped as much as five percent in the morning session in Hong Kong, before retreating to HK$46.45 at noon, 3.9 percent higher than the close in the previous session.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides will also explore their joint construction of co-branded ultra-fast charging stations in China to improve customer experience, the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  XPeng and Volkswagen forged a partnership in July 2023, when Volkswagen bought 4.99 percent of XPeng for about US$700 million with plans to jointly launch two Volkswagen-branded EV models by 2026 for the mid-sized car market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volkswagen later said it had developed a new architecture for smart electric vehicles with XPeng that would help it offer more affordable EVs in its largest market. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    China's services sector hits seven-month high

<img alt="China’s services sector expands in December as domestic consumption picks up. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786275_1_20250106105722.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's services activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven months in December, buoyed by accelerated growth in domestic demand, although overseas orders declined, according to a private sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global Services purchasing managers' index (PMI), which provides an independent snapshot of operating conditions in industries as such retail and tourism, rose to 52.2 in December from 51.5 the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  That growth pace was the fastest since May 2024, surpassing the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The readings also broadly align with the country's official PMI data released last week, which saw non-manufacturing activity considerably recover to 52.2 in December, after a neutral reading of 50.0 in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the survey showed that new business sub-index rose to 52.7 in December from 51.8 in November. However, inflows from abroad fell for the first time since August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  A business confidence reading remained positive but dipped to the second-lowest since March 2020, with companies worried by potential international trade disruption after Donald Trump returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports could also face tariff risks under a second Trump administration. Authorities have recently introduced measures to revitalise growth. (Reuters)

    Economic boost amid deficit 'main challenge': FS
   </title>

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday warned that promoting economic development amid a fiscal deficit would be Hong Kong's "main challenge", saying the government is studying how to boost income and cut costs to achieve a balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's "Voices from the Hall", where he gathered public feedback ahead of the upcoming budget, Chan said Hong Kong's economy grew steadily in the first three quarters of 2024 but not as strongly as expected due to high interest rates and geopolitical factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government is focusing on cost-cutting to tackle a deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although we need to move forward with public works projects and develop the Northern Metropolis, we have to prioritise developments according to their urgency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we need to study how to increase revenue, based on the principle that people who can afford to pay more do pay more, to minimise the impact on Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong's property slump would drop in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our property market has been experiencing an adjustment period, due to external factors and the high interest rate environment, among other reasons," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] property prices in Hong Kong have stabilised and transaction volume has increased."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the government will not restore a land-sale mechanism, which was scrapped more than a decade ago, in response to an attendee's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abolished in 2013, the application-based mechanism had allowed developers to apply for, and then offer a price for sites listed by the government, before authorities put the plot up for sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the government takes the lead with every quarterly land sale. We can assess the situation to see how many plots of land we're putting up for sale, what type of land is being sold, and how we're going to put those parcels out to market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After some attendees wanted to discuss the government's HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, the financial chief said labour and welfare officials are studying different views on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary is set to deliver his next budget speech on February 26.

<img alt="Wall Street closed higher on Friday, but still lost ground over the week. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786083_1_20250104053256.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rebounded on Friday as investors neared the end of a holiday-shortened week that also rang in a new year, which brought with it expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts and looser regulatory policies from the incoming administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  A broad rally sent all three major US stock indexes to a higher close, with megacap growth companies, such as Tesla and Nvidia, providing much of the muscle to the upside and putting the Nasdaq out front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even so, all three indexes posted modest declines for the week, with the S&P 500 logging its third weekly loss in four.
  <br>
  <br>
  A multi-session selloff put a dour finish on what was a banner year for the equities market, as continued momentum of artificial intelligence technology and the U.S. Federal Reserve's first policy rate cuts in three-and-a-half years helped fuel double-digit gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the late-in-the-year weakness, and a very oversold market, we finally saw some buyers step in," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. "Obviously the past week-and-a-half has been disappointing for the bulls, but volume has been light and there hasn't been a lot of news."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's just remember, starting next week, on Monday, that's when a lot of the big money managers come back to the desk," Detrick added. "We'll see if this bullish trend can continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers' index (PMI) surprised to the upside by gaining 0.9 point to 49.3, its highest reading since March, nudging ever closer to expansion territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of fairly robust economic data has called into question the need for additional interest rate cuts from the Fed in the near term due to the possibility of re-igniting inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the US 2025 economic outlook was positive, despite uncertainty about the impact of trade and other policies that may be pursued by the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly elected Congress convened for its first session on Friday, and US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take the oath of office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump's proposals - which include cutting corporate taxes, easing regulations and imposing tariffs - could boost corporate profits and energize the economy, they also risk placing upward pressure on inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 339.86 points, or 0.80 percent, to 42,732.13, the S&P 500 gained 73.92 points, or 1.26 percent, to 5,942.47 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 340.89 points, or 1.77 percent to 19,621.68.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Biden blocked the proposed sale of US Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel for US$14.9 billion, citing national security concerns. US Steel's shares dropped 6.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft shares gained 1.1 percent after the company said it would invest US$80 billion on AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol producers lost some ground after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said that alcoholic drinks should carry a label warning of cancer risks. Molson Coors and Brown Forman slid by 3.4 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. (Reuters)

    US blocks Nippon Steel's bid to purchase US Steel

<img alt="Nippon Steel has argued that its investments would shore up US Steel's output. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786056_1_20250103212811.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for US Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly US$3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also represents the final chapter in a high profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.

  But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up US Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks. (Reuters)

<img alt="Wall Street closed lower as investors weighed up their best strategy to deal with a strong US dollar and labour market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785945_1_20250103052420.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street see-sawed to a lower close on Thursday amid choppy trading, as investors tackled the new year having to contend with a strong labour market, a rising dollar and tumbling Tesla shares.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US stocks ended the session in negative territory, a reversal of an earlier rally but off session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some macro news but somewhat mixed and you know we have a very strong dollar today," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "There are a few hurdles over the next couple of weeks and those are next Friday’s employment data and the beginning of fourth quarter earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, we’re looking at choppiness and a struggle for direction until we get those hurdles out of the way," Cardillo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla sank after reporting its first annual drop in deliveries, as incentives failed to stem a decline in demand for its ageing line-up of electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report from the Labor Department showed initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits both fell last week, supporting the narrative of a solid jobs market and adding weight to the possibility that the US central bank could let its key interest rate stand at this month's policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking past uncertainties regarding the pace of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, policies to be enacted by the incoming Donald Trump administration and various hot spots of geopolitical unrest, market participants chose to focus on the strength of the United States economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes notched double-digit gains in 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 recording its best two-year run since 1997-1998. Those gains were driven by the US Federal Reserve's first rate cuts in three-and-a-half years, the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and expectations of pro-business policies from the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally lost steam in the closing weeks of 2024, with the S&P 500 and the Dow marking declines for December, as markets priced in the likelihood of fewer rate cuts from the Fed this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 13.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,868.56 points, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 30.00 points, or 0.16 percent, to 19,280.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 42,392.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P and the Nasdaq have now posted five consecutive sessions in the red, their longest losing streak since mid-April.

    Discounts for iPhones in China as competition heats up

<img alt="The flagship iPhone 16 Pro and the iPhone 16 Pro Max will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785914_1_20250102192311.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan (US$68.5) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-day promotion, running from January 4 to 7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3 percent during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42 percent, according to research firm IDC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts. (Reuters)

    Retail sales drop 7.3 percent in November

<img alt="Retail sales have declined for nine months in a row. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785893_2_20250102183155.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

    Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine ends

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)

<img alt="For 2024, however, the Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago, while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday to end 2024 on a gloomy note, but investors capped a strong overall year that was boosted by tech stocks, interest rate cuts and a robust US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.1 percent to 42,544, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.4 percent to 5,881.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent to 19,310.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was kind of a disappointing end to the year," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, noting that markets have closed lower for a few consecutive days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed the selling in recent days involved "some large portfolios reallocating money from stocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "this year was phenomenal" overall, he said, noting that major indexes moved higher and major tech stocks dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key factors included semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks, with enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping the "Magnificent Seven" US tech heavyweights – which include Apple and Nvidia – this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns about the pace of US interest rate cuts and uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump's trade and tariff agenda could cloud the outlook, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sosnick believed "there's a lot of optimism about the coming year." (AFP)

    China manufacturing continues expansion in December

<img alt="Chinese manufacturing activity continued to expand in December, although at a slower rate than in November. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785626_1_20241231161725.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets closed lower on the penultimate trading day of a year in which the benchmark indices have notched up strong gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.0 percent to 42,573.73, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 5,906.94, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.2 percent to 19,486.79.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sam Stovall of CFRA stressed that there was no major catalyst behind the shift, and the lead-up to New Year's Day was typically a low-volume period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, he expected that investors would be closely eyeing data that could give the US Federal Reserve reason to hold back on rate cuts, such as consumer inflation readings.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets have already reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls, investors are also monitoring further details of his trade policy -- after his threats of sweeping new tariffs on imports.
  <br>

<img alt="Startups in Hong Kong have employed about 18,000 people this year. Photo courtesy of the Information Services Department" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785286_1_20241228123616.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks stumbled on Friday as major companies saw their shares fall towards the end of a holiday week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 percent to 42,992, while the broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.1 percent to 5,970.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.5 percent to 19,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers said the sell-off caught many people by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a lot of people got very complacent about the idea that we would have a Santa Claus rally," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a tendency for markets to fare well in the last five trading days of the year, and the first two in the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The selling is very much across-the-board. There's not an obvious catalyst for it today," said Sosnick, noting that the trend was more ferocious as volumes were light.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major companies in particular saw their shares fall, with Microsoft slipping 1.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon lost 1.4 percent, while Nvidia dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the slump was both a "year-end adjustment" and due to a rise in US Treasury bond yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's putting the brakes on, applying the brakes to the market," he said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a low-key session little changed on Thursday as US Treasury bond yields retreated and a report pointed to higher holiday retail sales.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holiday consumer data showed a 3.8 percent increase in US retail spending from November 1 to December 24, according to a Mastercard SpendingPulse review of a key period for retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Solid spending during this holiday season underscores the strength we observed from the consumer all year," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist for the Mastercard Economics Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equities veered in and out of positive territory throughout the post-Christmas trading round when several overseas bourses were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 percent at 43,325.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 6,037, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 20,020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology companies that have led the market in much of 2024 mostly took a breather. These included Netflix, Tesla and Amazon, all of which declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, United States Steel fell 3 percent after would-be acquirer Nippon Steel of Japan pushed back the time-frame of its targeted acquisition to the first quarter of 2025 from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move came after a US government panel could not reach consensus on whether the transaction harmed US national security, pushing the decision to President Joe Biden, who has criticised the takeover. (AFP)

<img alt="Remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month boosted regional sentiment. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785073_1_20241226183315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian stocks rose in thin Boxing Day trade on Thursday, extending a "Santa Rally" with key markets Hong Kong and Sydney still shut for the holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei index closed up 1.1 percent, boosted by comments from the Bank of Japan governor and share price gains for top-selling automaker Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's plans for massive bond issuances in 2025 also bolstered investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though many in the region are still shaking off a bit of a holiday hangover, with several markets closed for Boxing Day, Asian stocks opened higher, riding a favourable wave from China's financial bond juggernaut," said Stephen Innes from SPI Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Bangkok and Taipei all edged up 0.1 percent, while Seoul lost 0.4 percent and Singapore shed 0.1 percent. Jakarta and Wellington were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Stockton, an analyst at Ned Davis Research, noted that the "Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets have traditionally fared well in the last five trading days of the year and the first two in the new year, a trend known as the "Santa Claus rally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among a number of possible reasons advanced by experts include the festive holiday mood and purchasing ahead of the end of the tax year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month also "influenced bullish regional sentiments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese market heavyweight Toyota ended nearly six percent higher after reports in the Nikkei business daily said it aimed to double its return on equity – a key measure of a company's financial performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In thin corporate news on Thursday, Japan Airlines reported a cyberattack that caused delays to domestic and international flights and prompted a temporary halt to ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  However later in the day the carrier said its systems had been restored after the "large data attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had been closed across Europe and North America for Christmas. The Dow Jones closed up 0.9 percent on the eve, while the tech-heavy S&P 500 rallied 1.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes all closed higher on Tuesday, with gains in megacap and growth stocks bolstering benchmarks in a truncated Christmas Eve session.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite scored four straight sessions of gains, with the S&P 500 taking its winning streak to three sessions, marking the first day of the seasonal Santa Claus rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks climbed on Tuesday, led by the 7.4 percent jump in Tesla shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, chip manufacturers were also buoyant. Broadcom and Nvidia rose 3.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 65 points, or 1.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 266 points, or 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 390 points, or 0.9 percent, to 43,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets in the US will be closed for Christmas on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines' shares edged up 0.6 percent after trading lower for much of the session. The carrier briefly grounded all its flights in the US on Tuesday due to an unspecified technical issue. (Reuters)

    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<img alt="" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784775_2_20241224090533.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets shook off early weakness and pushed higher on Monday, propelled by gains in Nvidia and some other large tech equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had been under pressure early amid concerns over higher US Treasury bond yields that impede year-end gains in a historically strong period of the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stocks didn't really have any direction in the morning, then we got this tech rally that just sort of drifted higher all day," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.2 percent at 42,906.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,974.07, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.0 percent to 19,764.89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks dropped last week after the Federal Reserve signalled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the market rose progressively in a quiet session with analysts pointing to low pre-holiday trading volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among economic releases, US consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in December amid concerns over the potential economic drag of new tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consumer confidence index slipped to 104.7 in December, down from a revised 112.8 last month, The Conference Board announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualcomm climbed 3.5 percent after a jury sided with it in a legal dispute with Arm over alleged breach of license agreements connected to Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. Arm Holdings fell 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordstrom fell 1.6 percent after Mexican investment group El Puerto de Liverpool and members of the Nordstrom family reached a deal that involves taking the department store chain private. The transaction is valued at US$6.25 billion, Nordstrom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will have a half session on Tuesday, Christmas Eve, followed by Wednesday's holiday. (AFP)

    Stellantis backtracks over planned Jeep layoffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stellantis confirmed on Saturday it was reversing a decision to lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep plant in the US state of Ohio, following the ouster of embattled chief executive Carlos Tavares.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No employees will be placed on indefinite layoff on January 5, 2025, due to the previously announced shift reduction. Employees are expected to return to work as scheduled after the new year," a Stellantis spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes as "Stellantis continues to reassess its strategy in North America," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automaker had announced the job cuts at the plant in Toledo, Ohio in early November, saying it was part of an effort to "regain its competitive edge" amid struggles with falling sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, a 14-brand group that includes Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat, had planned to trim operations at the Toledo South Assembly Plant from two shifts to one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 400 employees were to be transferred to a "third-party service provider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis sales sank in the third quarter, with a 42 percent drop in North America alone. The group offered promotional deals as US dealerships struggled to reduce their inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stellantis has significantly revised its approach since Tavares's December 1 exit, with the new interim CEO giving guarantees to the French and Italian governments on maintaining its production and investments in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French-Italian-American company had 258,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2003. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets rebounded on Friday following a pullback in US Treasury yields as markets braced for a looming US government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reading came in lower than expected, prompting a pullback in US Treasury bond yields that had risen after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled earlier this week they expect fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,930.85, up 1.1 percent for the day but down about two percent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 percent to 42,840.26 and the Nasdaq Composite: was up1.0 percent at 19,572.60.

  "We have seen a nice rebound from what was, in our view, an overreaction to the Fed's outlook on Wednesday," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones, pointing to Friday's inflation data as a supportive factor for equities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields pulled back following comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, who expressed confidence that the PCE data showed that inflation was returning to the Fed's target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next 12 to 18 months, rates can still go down a fair amount," Goolsbee told CNBC.

  US lawmakers raced to stave off a government shutdown set to bite within hours after Donald Trump and Elon Musk sabotaged a bipartisan agreement that would have averted a shutdown.

  If no deal is struck, the government will cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.

  European stocks finished the day lower although they cut their losses as Wall Street rebounded, with data showing tepid retail sales in the UK in the runup to Christmas dampening sentiment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose for a second straight month in November according to government data published on Friday, although the increase came in a touch below expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, and 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, headline prices rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was slightly below the median forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, triggering a sharp sell-off in the financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent US central bank is responsible for tackling inflation and unemployment, largely by hiking or lowering interest rates to affect demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This indirectly impacts the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, affecting everything from mortgages to car loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, the core PCE price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and by 0.1 percent from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both figures were slightly below expectations. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Thursday as Treasury bond yields climbed further in the wake of a Federal Reserve decision that prompted deep selling in the prior session.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices bounced early in the day, but the rebound faded as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates but signaled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 percent to 42,342.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,867.08, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.1 percent to 19,372.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's move in stocks is "kind of a lacklustre recovery effort," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of good news has been priced into this market," he said. "And now the market is going to sit back and see if a lot of that good news that's priced in actually comes to fruition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were monitoring Capitol Hill where an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump on a spending bill raised the possibility of a government shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Micron Technology sank 16.2 percent after projecting earnings that lagged estimates. While the chip company benefited from strong demand for artificial intelligence, analysts pointed to a drag from weak demand for personal computers and automobile clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden and other chains, jumped 14.7 percent after projecting a 1.5 percent rise in same-restaurant sales for its full fiscal year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.
