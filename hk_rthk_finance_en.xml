    Wall Street soars on Trump tariff pause

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher on Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones surged 7.9 percent to 40,608, and the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq jumped 12.2 percent to 17,124.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indexes bounced on Wednesday afternoon as Trump announced a 90-day pause in country-specific tariffs that came into place earlier that day, except levies on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affected US trading partners, excluding China, would instead face a 10 percent tariff rate, temporarily reverting to a level that took effect over the weekend, though that already roiled markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump singled out the world's second biggest economy, however, saying its tariff rate would be raised to a prohibitive 125 percent "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were waiting for any sense of a more reasonable trade process, saying this situation might "be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he cautioned that "China will become hyper-aware of the fact that they're now being isolated in this process." (AFP)

 Equities tumbled on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war by hitting China with tariffs of more than 100 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a brief respite on Tuesday, investors were once again panicking amid fears Trump's latest moves will spark a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly four percent, while South Korea's Kospi fell 1.74 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hong Kong stocks bucked the downward trend as reports say Beijing is mulling stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index closed up 0.68 percent to close at 20,264.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reuters news agency has reported that the nation's top leaders plan to meet as soon as Wednesday to hammer out measures to boost the economy and stabilise capital markets. (Agencies)

    Risk-off mode on as new US duties curb appetites

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index has been volatile amid a tit-for-tat tariffs fight that may escalate even further after Donald Trump's 50 percent levy takes effect on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799583_1_20250409143912.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 50 percent in extra US duties levied on imports from China on Wednesday have further accelerated deleveraging by investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  That comes as part of a risk-off mode taken by investors following escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, according to financial experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they warned that those investors who saw market downturns as an opportunity and went along with market momentum could find themselves on the short end of the stick as a result of volatilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,815 at the noon trading break, just as the new tariffs by the United States took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decline marked the index's lowest level since January 23, while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1 percent and mainland shares also returned to the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter which market you are talking about, they cannot avoid the three 'T's, which are Trump, trade and tariffs," said Feng Shuyan, an independent portfolio manager, who previously worked with Chubb investment management as associate general manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the latest market trend reflected the rather bearish sentiment among investors, which sped up ongoing deleveraging, and that such a downward trend might continue in the SAR given it is a free port.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre and is more correlated to global stock market performance," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, it will probably experience lots of volatilities, you will ride roller coasters, as the volatility, the deleveraging, the liquidation process will continue to bite," she told RTHK, adding that institutional investors' reductions on risk assets will further weigh on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cash is king, so maybe place a safe bet, " she advised investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, James Wong, chief executive of Almagest Asset Management, said the latest market retreat came amid speculation over the so-called "Mar-a-Lago Accord", a phrase coined last year that refers to efforts to weaken the US dollar and thereby reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market participants tend to think that the US is going to have this tariff coalition, and the receiving end of that coalition is going to be China, so it's going to be a duel between two giants now," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, I think none of the market participants are eager to get into the market and the short-term fluctuations are hardly indicators that can help us judge what is the general flow of capital and where the market is heading."
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggests investors stay calm and not chase the momentum to avoid a "1929 incident", which saw a market crash on Wall Street that year and led to the largest recession in modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you're chasing momentum, chances are you are going to be played out by the volatility," he said, noting that other assets such as bonds from Australia could instead be favoured by investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What could happen next is going to be very, very messy, in our opinion, and the general direction is that the capital markets is going down for a prolonged period."

<img alt="HKTDC's Irina Fan says Hong Kong's diversified trade links will help it withstand any pressure from new US tariffs. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799560_1_20250409111312.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

 Mainland and Hong Kong shares fell at the open on Wednesday as the US trade war escalated, following Washington's decision to impose 104 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, starting around noon, Hong Kong time.

  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index sank 3.14 percent, or 632 points, to 19,494, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.13 percent, or 35 points, to 3,110.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled again on Tuesday as initially successful efforts to rebound from big losses faded amid worries over US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent to 4,982, its first close below 5,000 points in nearly a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended down 0.8 percent at 37,645, a swing of about 1,780 points below its session peak, while the Nasdaq shed 2.2 percent to 15,267.
  <br>
  <br>
  After three days of losses, Wall Street stocks opened buoyantly as traders embraced talk of White House negotiations with Japan and South Korea in the hopes Trump's trade onslaught might be short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investors grew edgy as the day progressed with no concrete progress. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed plans for massive tariffs on China to go into effect overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously investors are clamouring for clarity and there still isn't any," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, who estimated that the market now sees a greater than 50 percent chance of a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's "Liberation Day" event announcing tariffs on major US trading partners last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials have signalled openness to dealmaking while blasting China for enacting sharp retaliatory tariffs in response to the new US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump plans to impose another 50 percent duty on Chinese goods at midnight, bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished the day in the red, while most of the Dow was also in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Especially big losers in the blue-chip index included Apple, down five percent and Nike, down 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But UnitedHealth Group surged 5.4 percent after the Trump administration finalised a rule boosting payments to insurers under the government Medicare programme. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to "fight to the end" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks.

  <br>
  In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain "the smooth operation of the capital market".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt rose more than one percent, having dropped more than four percent on Monday. (AFP/Xinhua)

 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against Trump's tariffs on Friday with extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods, adding to the 10 to 15 percent tariffs it had imposed on US agricultural goods in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combined rate threatens to all but end the agricultural trade between the two countries. (Reuters)

    Any Trump bid to weaken greenback 'set to fail'

<img alt="Donald Trump will find it extremely hard to get China and Europe to consent to a devaluation for the greenback after antagonising them with his tariffs' move. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799408_1_20250408135600.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

    Tokyo's Nikkei up 5.8pc as US tariffs fuel volatility

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another state holding company, China Electronics Technology Group, said it would boost share buybacks in listed units to bolster investor confidence. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

    JPMorgan Chase CEO warns tariffs will slow growth

<img alt="JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799345_1_20250408084713.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Monday that US President Donald Trump's tariffs will likely lift inflation, describing himself as "very cautious" in light of the rising recession risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon, an influential figure in markets as the longest serving CEO of a major Wall Street firm, said the US economy had been steady "for years" but was "already weakening" even before Trump's watershed tariff announcement last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on investments and capital flows, the effect on corporate profits and the possible effect on the US dollar," Dimon wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back," said Dimon, adding "my most serious concern is how this will affect America's long-term economic alliances."
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan analysts published a note on Friday expecting US GDP to contract this year "under the weight of the tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also recently raised their risk of global recession to 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that if most of Trump's April 9 tariffs take effect, these charges - alongside likely sectoral duties - could tip their forecast to a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and global equities have been in free fall since Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week in a move the president touted as "Liberation Day" from international trade rules he argues have harmed the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation, along with continued high fiscal deficits, "the remilitarization of the world" and major investments supporting infrastructure and the green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While inflation has come down, most of what I see in the future is inflationary," said Dimon, who backs the need for reducing the US deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These large deficits are not sustainable - I do not know whether it will cause a real problem in six months or six years - the sooner we deal with it, the better," Dimon said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Monday following a volatile session amid rising recession worries due to US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow and S&P 500 ended lower despite flirting with positive territory, while the Nasdaq mustered a modest gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.9 percent at 37,965.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,062.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 15,603.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets again opened sharply lower following a gloomy round in Asian and European bourses on the weakening global growth outlook after Trump's sweeping tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the opening, major indices briefly surged into positive territory following a report that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials quickly denied the story, saying that in an interview on Fox News this official was misquoted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though Kevin Hassett was misquoted, market participants could see what would happen if there is a modicum of good news," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management, who is among market watchers who consider stocks oversold after the recent period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists see the tariffs as boosting the risk of recession in light of a possible resurgence in inflation and a slowdown in capital investment from businesses unsettled by shifting US policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with traders overwhelmingly projecting such a move at the central bank's June meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes updates on US consumer prices, as well as earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large US banks. (AFP)

<img alt="All three major US indices were at more than one-year lows in early trading on Monday. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799307_1_20250407222802.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Monday amid worries that a trade war induced by US President Donald Trump's tariffs will spark a global economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices were down more than 3 percent in early trading, reflecting continued angst after Trump's team over the weekend shrugged off the worldwide carnage in markets since his tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was down 3.8 percent in early trading, coming off its worst week since Covid; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,343 points, or 3.5 percent; and the Nasdaq composite was 4.2 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indices were at more than one-year lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump remained defiant on Monday. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, within the first hour of trading, stocks were swinging up, then down again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow briefly erased a loss of 1,700 points, shot up more than 800 points, then went back to a loss of 414 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 likewise made sudden up-and-down lurching movements and was down 1.3 percent in the first hour of trading. (Agencies)

<img alt="Paul Chan says investors should exercise caution going forward as market fluctuations are expected to continue. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799293_1_20250407191203.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    HK stocks slump has retail investors seeing red

<img alt="Retail investors mostly saw red on the worst day for Hong Kong stocks in nearly three decades. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1799281_2_20250407180508.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European equities collapsed on a black Monday for markets after China hammered the United States with its own hefty tariffs, ramping up a trade war many fear could spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trading floors were overcome by a wave of selling as investors fled to the hills, with Hong Kong's loss of 13 percent its worst in nearly three decades, while Taipei dived 9.7 percent, Tokyo almost eight percent and Frankfurt 10 percent in early trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 3,021.51 points to end 13.22 percent down at 19,828.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index tumbled 13.75 percent to end at 7,262.72, and the Hang Seng Tech Index plunged 17.16 percent to 4,401.51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13 percent loss for the Hang Seng Index marked its worst day since October 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, vice commerce minister Ling Ji told representatives of US firms its tariffs "firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, including American companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes that US President Donald Trump would rethink his policy in light of the turmoil were dashed when he said he would not make a deal with other countries unless trade deficits were solved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," he said of the ructions that have wiped trillions of dollars off company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The savage selling in Asia was across the board, with no sector unharmed – tech firms, carmakers, banks, casinos and energy firms all felt the pain as investors abandoned riskier assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the biggest losers, Chinese e-commerce titans Alibaba tanked nearly 18 percent and rival JD.com shed 15 percent, while Japanese tech investment giant SoftBank dived more than 11 percent and Sony gave up nine percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing was also hammered more than 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rush to sell saw market turnover hit a record HK$621 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai shed more than seven percent, with China's state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment vowing to help ensure "stable operations" of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore plunged nearly eight percent, while Seoul gave up more than five percent, triggering a so-called sidecar mechanism – for the first time in eight months – that briefly halted some trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney, Wellington, Manila and Mumbai were also deep in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could see a recession happen very quickly in the US, and it could last through the year or so, it could be rather lengthy," said Steve Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a recession in the US, of course, China will feel it as well because demand for its goods will be hit even harder," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said spiralling trade tensions had "crushed confidence in markets".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When confidence craters, markets crash and that's what we've seen as a result of the US administration's self-defeating tariffs policy," Chalmers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock markets plummeted at the start of trading on Monday, with Frankfurt slumping up to 10 percent and London and Paris each dropping about six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam and Oslo saw losses of more than five percent and Milan down over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US futures also signaled further weakness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the S&P 500 lost 3.7 percent while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the Nasdaq lost 4.7 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan said on Monday the government will pay close attention to the stock market and ensure that the city remains financially stable.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong stocks plunged on the first trading session after Beijing hit back over the US imposition of an extra 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by announcing reciprocal levies of the same quantum on American goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was down about 9 percent in early trading on Monday, with tech, solar, banking and online retailers' shares plunging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong has a strong financial base that can deal with any volatility in the market and that authorities will stay vigilant to market changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fundamentals are very strong, liquidity is high, and therefore, we have been fair and open in our operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our core and fundamentals are very strong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government will continue to be vigilant together with the regulators to monitor closely the market to maintain a stable financial market.” (additional reporting by Reuters)

    Hang Seng Index slumps on US tariff sell-off

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial markets in Hong Kong and across the border dived on Monday as markets around the world crumbled in the face of a widening global trade war and fears it will unleash a deep recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng index slumped more than 10 percent in morning trade which, if sustained, would make for the benchmark's largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Banking stocks collapsed, with Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered tumbling 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index fell more than 5 percent with selling in nearly every sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yuan slipped to its lowest since January and bonds rallied sharply.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, which is now facing US tariffs of over 50 percent, responded in kind on Friday by slapping extra levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland indexes of solar companies and household appliance makers notched losses around 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng volatility index shot to its highest since October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of online giants Alibaba and Tencent were down more than 8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a harsh time when markets go down so dramatically," said Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, who noted that the latest plunge came as investors race to liquidate some of their shares in the face of a cash crunch following a market meltdown, especially for those who trade using margin financing, or borrowing money from brokers to purchase an investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one should get over the initial panic of wanting to sell, because a lot of the time these markets rebound within days or weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That said, this current situation with tariffs being imposed by Trump, and then retaliatory tariffs by China does indicate that this is a situation that's unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management, said "the [market sell-off] was beyond my expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a liquidation sale as people sought to exit [the market]. But the magnitude of the decline was more than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects Beijing to offer stimulus measures in the short term to stabilise the market, such as a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks or a tax cut as part of a package of stronger fiscal support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the chance of the global economy to enter a recession this year has increased to at least 60 to 70 percent following the tit-for-tat tariff disputes between the world's two largest economies, Wong said a deal between the two sides is needed but difficult to realise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China knows that if it complies with US demands, this will reinforce Trump's ego and he will ask for more later on, that's why China took a hard stance now. It would be very difficult for both sides to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We probably will be in a bear market for a long time," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sullivan noted that the a key event to follow is whether the US Congress representatives from both parties will stop Trump from implementing the reciprocal tariffs – by revoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Act that Trump used to impose the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Historically, if you saw the VIX index (a barometer for market uncertainty) is above 32, 33  percent, you'd normally get a policy changed by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] the VIX index on Friday got above 40 percent, and we've seen no change of Trump turning about or evoking his trade policy. So it's a very difficult position," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if they [Congress members] feel that their own caucuses and electorate are going to turn against them, they will have to make a choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do they stick with Trump who is unlikely to have a third term, or do they stick with their electorate, and support them and go against trump?
  <br>
  <br>
  "That'll be a very interesting thing that we're likely to see in the next couple of weeks."

 Japan's Nikkei share index plunged further on Monday, as US futures pointed to additional losses on Wall Street over President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  In early trade in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was off 7.35 percent, adding to a 2.75-percent drop on Friday, while in Seoul the Kospi was off 4.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's stock index plummeted 6 percent at the open on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results "won't come overnight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, the government must take all available means" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was "extremely disappointing and regrettable," adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. "But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth. (Agencies)

 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, it said on Saturday, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of President Donald Trump's 25 percent tariff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, confirmed the temporary export suspension after the Times newspaper reported the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly, is highly exposed to the new tariffs. The United States is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20 percent share, data from industry body SMMT shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Britain's biggest producers by volume, said in its statement that the US was an important market for its luxury brands. It sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually and exports to the US account for almost a quarter of sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US 25 percent tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3, the day after Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire US presidential adviser Elon Musk said on Saturday he hoped Europe and the United States would agree to join in a free-trade zone after US leader Donald Trump unleashed heavy global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sweeping tariffs announced earlier this week sent global stocks tumbling, worried allies, and raised the prospect of others – possibly the European Union – raising tariffs themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, which faces a 20 per cent tariff, has already vowed to retaliate in "a calm, carefully phased, unified way", EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the United States and Europe can establish a very close partnership," Musk said in a video address to a gathering of the Italian hard-right party La Liga.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America," he added in the video, posted on Musk's social media platform X by La Liga's leader, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire said he favoured "more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America" for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That has certainly been my advice to the president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he reiterated his condemnation of what he saw as mass immigration. (AFP)

    Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair

<img alt="Jerome Powell said on Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798991_1_20250405044209.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was "too soon" to consider changes to US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  "CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. "I fully intend to serve all of my term," he said during the Virginia event. (AFP)

    Major Wall Street indices fall by over 5 percent

<img alt="A trader on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798992_1_20250405045214.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another bruising sell-off on Friday as major indices slumped more than five percent following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent the entire session in the red, shrugging off solid employment figures and fixating on China's quick retaliation against the US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 led the major indices lower, ending at 5,074.08, down 6.0 percent for the day and more than nine percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 5.8 percent to 15,587.79, placing it in a bear market, defined as a 20 percent fall from a recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.5 percent to 38,314.86, its first close under 40,000 points since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses increased somewhat following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation due to tariff increases he characterized as "significantly larger than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, government data showed the US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets focused on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've essentially got an escalating trade war," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "We're at the beginning of a global slowdown if these tariffs remain in place."
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell while the Dow index was overwhelmingly a sea of red, with Apple falling 7.3 percent, Chevron 8.2 percent and Boeing 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were a few equities that rebounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nike and Lululemon Athletica rose three percent or more after Trump spoke optimistically about trade talks with Vietnam, from which both companies import apparel. Clothing importers had been among the most hard-hit sectors on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homebuilders were another bright spot in light of falling mortgage rates as markets bet on easing monetary policy. Lennar rose 2.4 percent, while KB Home tacked on 3.5 percent. (AFP)

    Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer

<img alt="The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798987_1_20250405031437.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added on Friday that he would "continue working in good faith with China."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. "TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful," said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called "The People's Bid for TikTok", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble again, extending rout on trade war

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Friday, shrugging off solid US hiring data and extending a rout after China retaliated in kind to President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices were stuck in the red, pointing to another brutal session after the S&P 500 on Thursday experienced its largest drop since 2020 following Trump's sweeping "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 15 minutes into trading, the broad-based S&P 500 was down 3.2 percent at 5,223.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slumped 2.8 percent to 39,412, while the Nasdaq 3.6 percent to 15,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated and significantly above February's revised 117,000 figure, said the Department of Labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets fixated on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his plan, saying on his Truth Social platform that "my policies will never change."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's trend marks a "continuation of the worry regarding the announcement of the US tariffs on Wednesday, combined with China's quicker-than-expected retaliatory tariffs," said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stovall said investors are ignoring the jobs data, in part because it could lead the Federal Reserve to "continue to remain on the sidelines" following talk that the weakened US outlook with tariffs might prompt the central bank to cut interest rates more quickly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street led a global markets bloodbath on Thursday as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's trade war, while the White House insisted the US economy will emerge victorious.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 4.8 percent in its biggest loss since 2020. The tech-rich Nasdaq plummeted 6.0 percent and the Dow Jones 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shock waves also tore through markets in Asia and Europe in the wake of Trump's Wednesday announcement, while foreign leaders signaled readiness to negotiate but also threatened counter-tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump slapped 10 percent import duties on all nations and far higher levies on imports from dozens of specific countries, including top trade partners China and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate tariffs of 25 percent on all foreign-made cars also went into effect and Canada swiftly responded with a similar levy on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat, paused production at some Canadian and Mexican assembly plants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump dismissed the turmoil, insisting to reporters as he left for a weekend at his Florida golf resorts, that stocks will "boom."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old president says he wants to make the United States free from reliance on foreign manufacturers, in a massive economic reshaping that he likened to a medical procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's what is expected," he said of the market reaction. "The patient was very sick. The economy had a lot of problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went through an operation. It's going to be a booming economy. It's going to be amazing." (AFP)

 Stock markets and the dollar tumbled on Thursday after President Donald Trump's latest tariffs salvo against countries worldwide, fanning a trade war that many fear will spark recession and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dollar slumped by as much as 2.6 percent versus the euro, its biggest intraday plunge in a decade, and suffered sharp losses also against the yen and British pound.
  <br>
  <br>
  On stock markets, Wall Street's main indices opened sharply lower, with the Nasdaq falling more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The simultaneous decline in both stocks and the US dollar speaks volumes about investor confidence in Trump's trade policy," said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in apparel companies, which rely on cheap labour in factories abroad, with Nike sinking 11 percent and Gap shedding 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the globe, shares in major sectors including auto, luxury and banking also took big hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed by more than four percent, and the Paris stock market led losses in Europe as it fell over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices plummeted around seven percent to under US$70 per barrel as an economic downturn would hit demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold, a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 an ounce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on government bonds, another haven investment, fell as investors fled risky assets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equity markets tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump delivered a "haymaker" blow with sweeping tariffs against US partners and rivals, fanning a global trade war that many fear will spark recessions and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: "President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street "had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve "pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo pared its hefty drop but still ended down 2.8 percent, while Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Wellington managed to eke out a small gain as New Zealand faced smaller tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt all tumbled more than one percent, while Vietnam's stock exchange dived 7.8 percent after the country was hit with levies of almost 50 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures were also battered, with the Dow dropping two percent, the Nasdaq plunging more than three percent and the S&P 500 off 2.8 percent off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Safe havens rallied as traders sought to dump risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 and the yen strengthened to 147.04 per dollar from 150.50 the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other currencies, the euro and pound both jumped more than one percent against the dollar on fears about the US economy and bets that the Fed will have to cut interest rates to deal with the impact on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big corporate losers, Sony shed 4.8 percent, while its South Korean rival Samsung was down 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car titan Toyota was off more than five percent, Nissan lost 3.7 percent and Honda was down 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-listed tech investment firm SoftBank was off close to four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed e-commerce giants fell after the removal of a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China.
  <br>
  <br>

    Tariffs will rebound on US: economists

<img alt="The punitive 54 percent tariffs heaped on Chinese exports from such ports as Qingdao in Shandong can be counterbalanced by pro-active promotions of domestic consumption, says an economist. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798796_1_20250403160427.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.
 <br>
  <br>
  They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union," Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost "every single country" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at  Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that "what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on].
  <br>
  <br>
  "The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that "we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the "de minimis" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war "closer to home", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention," said d'Assier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And they have means to retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."
  <br>
  <br>
  D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'".

 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described US President Donald Trump's universal tariffs as a major blow to the world economy and said that the European Union was prepared to respond with countermeasures if negotiations failed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel," she said in a statement read out in Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, on Thursday ahead of an EU-Central Asia partnership summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier unveiled a 10 percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States – with a higher 20 percent rate for the European Union – kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall US and global economic growth. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks sank more than two percent in opening trades on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against trade partners, including 34 percent on imports from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index dropped 2.43 percent, or 564 points, to 22,638, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.91 percent, or 30 points, to 3,319.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial markets have been jolted by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements, with US stock futures down by as much as three percent early on Thursday and Tokyo’s market leading losses in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices sank more than US$2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the price of gold hit a new record, crossing its previous record at around Wednesday 2300 GMT and then continuing to climb above US$3,150 an ounce, as traders piled into the safe haven asset. (Agencies)

<img alt="US President Donald Trump holds a signed executive order on tariffs, in the Rose Garden at the White House. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798734_1_20250403084633.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

    'Tariffs will change global trading system'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to "fight" against US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he warned will "fundamentally change the global trading system."
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's unveiling of 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world and harsh additional levies on key trading partners ignited global anger, but for Canada the impact of the latest announcement was limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously announced US levies on Canadian steel and aluminium remain in place. Canada may also be hit hard by Trump's auto sector tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But America's northern neighbour and largest trading partner was not singled out for additional tariffs, and Canadian goods compliant with an existing North American free trade agreement appear exempt from new levies for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney noted that Trump's latest announcement "preserved a number of important elements of our relationship, the commercial relationship between Canada and the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who replaced Justin Trudeau last month, said Trump's trade war will "negatively" impact the US economy and will "directly affect millions of Canadians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to fight these tariffs with counter measures. We are going to protect our workers," Carney said in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a crisis it is important to come together and it is essential to act with purpose and with force and that is what we will do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week in a call with Trump, the pair agreed to discuss the future of bilateral trade after the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls currently project Carney's Liberal Party will win a majority. (AFP)

    US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese

 Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are "not the act of a friend" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia will however not retaliate against the announced 10-percent tariff with its own trade duties, the prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the act of a friend," Albanese told a news conference after Trump's tariff announcement, saying one in four Australian jobs depended on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Australian leader, who faces a tightly contested general election on May 3, said Australia charged nothing on US imports and should face zero US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has been Australia's strongest military ally since World War II, and the two countries have joined with Britain in a deal to provide Australia's navy with stealthy nuclear-powered submarines.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new measures could change how people see their relationship, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations long-standing friendship," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship," the Australian leader added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian blue-chip stocks dipped nearly two percent in early trade as one of the first global markets reacted to Trump's trade action. (AFP)

<img alt="More volatility is expected, with US futures moving decisively lower late Wednesday after Trump announced his tariffs plan. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798722_1_20250403060921.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks whipped through another dizzying day on Wednesday in the final hours before President Donald Trump’s unveiling of tariffs promised as part of his Liberation Day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,670, but only after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1 percent and a later gain of 1.1 percent. It’s had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 235 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 42,225, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 percent to close at 17,601. Both also veered from sharply lower in the morning to sharply higher in the afternoon before doubling back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla helped knock the market around after initially falling more than 6 percent following a report that it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last year’s first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla is one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of its immense size, and it’s faced backlash due to anger about CEO Elon Musk’s leading the US government’s efforts to cut spending. But its stock erased its loss from the morning and ended with a gain of 5.3 percent following a report from Politico that Trump has told others that Musk will step back from his government role in coming weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 percent tax on imports from China, a 20 percent tax on imports from the European Union, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the companies whose shares fell in after-hours trading were Deckers Outdoor, the maker of Uggs, down 9.3 percent; Lululemon was down 8.8 percent; and home products retailer Williams-Sonoma was down 8.4 percent. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday on a quiet trading day as investors braced for Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which he has dubbed "Liberation Day".
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has not unveiled the details of his plan, leaving traders guessing ahead of the announcement, which the White House has now penned for Wednesday at 4pm local time in Washington (2000 GMT), after Wall Street markets close.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1 percent to 41,989, while the broad-based S&P 500 shook off a recent slump to close up 0.4 percent at 5,633.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also finished in the green, gaining 0.9 percent to 17,449, a day after posting its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records, and it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce - that’s up from less than US$2,700 at the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In stocks, Tesla charged 3.6 percent higher a day ahead of reporting how many vehicles it delivered during the first three months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the losing end of Wall Street was Johnson & Johnson, which dropped 7.6 percent after a US bankruptcy court judge denied the company’s settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It’s the third time the company’s attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2 percent, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7 percent. (Agencies)

<img alt="Jane Street is said to be in talks with Hongkong Land to take over two more floors in Central. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798414_1_20250401120606.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jane Street, one of the world's largest quant trading firms and market makers, is planning a sharp increase in Hong Kong office space, two people familiar with the matter said.
 <br>
  <br>
  The New York-based firm is negotiating with landlord Hongkong Land to lease two more floors at Chater House, an office tower in Central, they said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the deal materialises, Jane Street will occupy six floors of the 30-storey building, totalling over 110,000 sq ft of office space, compared to just two-and-a-half floors a year ago.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street and Hongkong Land declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising Sino-US tensions, China has regained popularity as an investment destination and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 15 percent in the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Average daily turnover shot to US$28 billion for the first two months of the year, a 70 percent jump from the same time last year, data shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citadel Securities and Tower Research Capital have also been recruiting and expanding their offices in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street employs 400 people in the city, one of the people said, adding that its Hong Kong-based team covers not just the mainland and Hong Kong but also Japan, Singapore and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is hiring for more than 40 roles in Hong Kong, the firm's website shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Known for high-frequency trading and its dominance of the exchange traded funds market, Jane Street has seen explosive growth in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a registered market maker on the Hong Kong bourse and was approved to trade yuan-denominated shares in Hong Kong in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm earned around US$6.1 billion in the first half of last year, nearly double that of the same period a year earlier, Bloomberg reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jane Street plans to take the two floors used by Point72 Asset Management, according to one of the people.
  <br>
  <br>
  Point72 is moving out because it wants more office space, local media have said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tesla investors are bracing for a drop in first-quarter vehicle deliveries as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics exacerbates weakening demand for the electric vehicle maker's lineup.
 <br>
  <br>
  Musk promised Tesla would return to growth this year after its annual deliveries fell for the first time in 2024, and Wall Street will be watching to see how a refreshed Model Y SUV and incentives made a difference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla has been grappling with rising global competition and mass protests against Musk's role overseeing cuts to federal spending as an adviser to US President Donald Trump.
  <br>

  </a>
  , RTHK's San Francisco correspondent Mark Niu said dismay at Musk's government cutbacks plus disdain towards his personal politics was affecting Tesla's business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's certainly has taken a toll on Tesla's stock [price] which rose sharply when Donald Trump won the election with Musk being his biggest financial backer. It hit a record of US$480 and today it's around US$259  ... with regard to sales one thing is quite clear: sales of new Tesla cars have slumped in Europe."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company has been offering discounts and other incentives, including low-cost financing, but these seemed to have had little impact in Europe, where sales declined in the first two months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of China-made Teslas fell as well. Chinese rivals including BYD have ramped up a price war and launched at least six models in the past year to take on the Model Y. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 97.53 points, or 0.42 percent, to open at 23,217.11 points on Tuesday, as the market prepares for more news about US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day" and has pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, a private-sector survey has shown that mainland factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in four months in March, buoyed by stronger demand and robust export orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI climbed to 51.2 last month from 50.8 in February. That was higher than analyst expectations of 51.1. A number above 50 signals growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebound broadly aligned with an official PMI released on Monday that showed manufacturing activity growing at its quickest rate in a year. (with additional reporting by agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI on Monday said it raised US$40 billion in a new funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at US$300 billion, the biggest capital-raising session ever for a startup.
 <br>
  <br>
  The infusion of cash comes in a partnership with Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group and "enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further," the San Francisco-based company said in a post on its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Their support will help us continue building AI systems that drive scientific discovery, enable personalised education, enhance human creativity, and pave the way toward AGI (artificial general intelligence) that benefits all of humanity," the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  AGI refers to a computing platform with human-level intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank said in a release that it is on a mission to realise Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that surpasses human intelligence, and that OpenAI is the partner closest to achieving that goal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advancement of OpenAI's AI models is key to achieving AGI and ASI, and massive computing power is essential," SoftBank stated in its rationale for the latest investment in the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank is to pump US$10 billion into OpenAI to start, and US$30 billion more by the end of this year pending certain conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI plans to scale its infrastructure and "deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks shook off some early gloom about Donald Trump's imminent tariff announcement to close mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 bouncing into positive territory from a six-month low.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has flagged Wednesday as "Liberation Day," and pledged to impose additional sweeping levies against trading partners, without providing additional details about his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amid the uncertainty, volatility surged in early trading on Monday, with the CBOE Volatility Index, colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge," jumping more than 10 percent before cooling sharply as the day progressed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an earlier decline to close up 1.0 percent at 42,001.76, as did the broad-based S&P 500 Index, which gained 0.6 percent to 5,611.85.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.1 percent to 17,299.29.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the resurgence, the S&P posted its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think [traders] were taking advantage of an oversold situation," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They still have another day in which to sort of play around," before Trump's big tariff announcement, Stovall added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Moderna fell 8.9 percent after the departure of a top US Food and Drug Administration official who disagreed with Trump's new health secretary, noted vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (AFP)

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped by 13 percent year on year in February, partly due to high pre-festival spending from the Lunar New Year holiday falling in the same month last year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798288_1_20250331172638.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales suffered a notable decline last month, dropping by 13 percent year on year partially due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday showed that turnover of the city's total retail sales was provisionally estimated to be HK$29.4 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was significantly lower compared with HK$35.4 billion registered in January when sales dropped by 3.1 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Taking the first two months of the year together, the value retail sales were estimated to have decreased by 7.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  The volume of retail sales also notably declined, dropping by 15 percent, compared with the 5.1 percent retreat seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the first two months of the year, the total volume declined by 9.9 percent on a yearly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the figures, a government spokesperson said the steep declines were partly due to the different timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in late January this year but in February last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumer spending in the local market normally attains a seasonal high before the festival," a government statement reads.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesperson noted that when retail sales for the first two months of the year were bunched together, which could remove such a holiday effect, the decline was smaller compared with the drop in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, the spokesperson acknowledged the challenges ahead but said various measures by the central and the SAR governments will offer support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The SAR government's proactive efforts to promote tourism and mega events, and the sustained increases in employment earnings in local labour market, would benefit the retail sector, though it would continue to face challenges from the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysed by categories, sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most significant decline – dropping by nearly 50 percent in the first two months of the year while that of furniture and fixtures decreased by 25.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco, however, rose 0.7 percent year on year, followed closely by the 0.6 percent seen for medicines and cosmetics.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in a year in March, an official factory survey showed on Monday, in a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy as it deals with an escalating US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 50.5 in March versus 50.2 in February, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was the highest PMI reading since March 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, accelerated to 50.8 from 50.4.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has kept its economic target for this year unchanged at "around five percent", despite new tariffs from US President Donald Trump, which threaten to hit the massive export sector, a key driver for the US$18 trillion economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government has pledged more fiscal stimulus, increased debt issuance, further monetary easing and put even greater emphasis on boosting domestic demand to cushion the impact of the trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed a cumulative 20 percent tariff on all Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president is also preparing to announce "reciprocal" tariffs on Wednesday, a move designed to address trade imbalances, which could hit Chinese goods with additional levies. (Reuters)

<img alt="The fundraising will boost the ability of the banks to bolster the real economy. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1798177_1_20250331072356.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four of the mainland's largest state-owned banks said on Sunday they plan to raise a combined 520 billion yuan (US$71.60 billion) in private placements from investors, including the Ministry of Finance (MOF), after Beijing pledged to help them support the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fundraising, which aims to boost the banks' core tier-1 capital, comes after policymakers vowed earlier this month to recapitalise major state banks to the tune of 500 billion yuan to boost their ability to bolster the real economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of China said it aims to raise up to 165 billion yuan and China Construction Bank plans private placements of up to 105 billion yuan, filings released by the banks on Sunday said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of Communications said it will sell shares of as much as 120 billion yuan, and Postal Savings Bank of China will raise up to 130 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance ministry, a major shareholder of the four banks, will be involved in all four capital raises, the filings showed. The ministry is set to become the controlling shareholder for Bank of Communications following the share issue, the bank said in its filing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The four banks said that capital replenishment from the MOF is a crucial move from the government to support their stable operations and development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry analysts said that the capital replenishment is a proactive measure that will strengthen the banks' capital foundations and optimise their capital structures.
  <br>

  This move will enhance their operational resilience and risk management capabilities, enabling them to better serve the real economy and stabilise the financial system, according to analysts.

  China has set its economic growth target for this year at roughly 5 percent, unchanged from last year, as the government pledged more fiscal resources to fend off deflationary pressures and offset the impact from US tariffs. (Xinhua, Reuters)

 Stock markets plunged Friday as a closely watched US inflation reading heated up amid intensifying concerns over fallout from US President Donald Trump's incoming wave of tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automakers fell further as they brace for 25 percent US tariffs due to kick in next week along with a raft of "reciprocal" surcharges tailored to different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market mood has soured over fears that Trump's plans will trigger tit-for-tat measures that would rekindle inflation, which could put the brakes on interest rate cuts and spark a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors remain nervous over the economic repercussions from President Trump's tariff threats, just days before he unleashes his 'reciprocal tariffs'" on April 2, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London just about held the line, closing barely off in the week's final session. But Paris, Frankfurt and Milan all slid around one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, all three major indexes closed sharply lower, with the Dow tumbling 1.7 percent, the S&P 500 losing 2.0 percent and Nasdaq diving 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide came after official data showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, remained unchanged last month at 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But another key figure, core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose more than expected at 2.8 percent in February on an annual basis, up from the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, automakers Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Peugeot and Fiat, fared particularly badly. Shares in General Motors and Ford also slumped on Wall Street. (AFP)

    MTR fares to freeze under adjustment mechanism

<img alt="While MTR fares will freeze for 2025-26, commuters could face a steep hike next year after 3.36 percent of adjustments are brought forward. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797892_1_20250328173801.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There is relief for MTR passengers after the fare adjustment formula – which takes into account factors such as inflation and median household income – showed that fares would freeze for the coming year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Under its operating agreement with the government, the MTR Corporation (MTRC) is entitled to an annual fare review using figures published by the Census and Statistics Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on the department's latest figures on Friday, transportation sector wages rose 3.1 percent year on year, while inflation stood at 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The mean value of 2.25 percent is then curtailed by a so-called "productivity factor" linked to the MTRC’s profit from property development. The more it earns in a particular year, the higher the productivity factor.
  <br>
  <br>
  This year the productivity factor amounted to a deduction of 0.8 percent, bringing the increase down from 2.25 percent to 1.45 percent, below the threshold of 1.5 percent required to trigger an actual adjustment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even if it exceeds the threshold, there is still another "affordability cap" where the actual fare adjustment cannot be higher than the change in median monthly household income, which recorded a slight drop last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result of these constraints, fares will be frozen for the first time since 2022-23.
  <br>
  <br>
  The intended 1.45 percent increase, together with another 1.91 percent rise supposedly brought forward from last year, will both be rolled over to 2026-27, which means commuters could face a steep hike next year.

    HK stock swings propel derivatives trade to highs

<img alt="The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has surpassed the record set last year by 70 percent. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797841_1_20250328124759.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Big swings in stock markets and hedge fund activity have propelled Hong Kong's derivative trading to unprecedented highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The number of outstanding futures and options contracts on the city's bourse has reached 22 million so far this year, surpassing the record set in 2024 by 70 percent in less than three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts and investors attribute the sharp rise in the use of derivatives this year to the craze around Chinese technology firms and the growing use of hedging tools by long-short funds to navigate geopolitical and tariff uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing has boosted its derivatives offering over the past six months to meet the market's growing demand as investors look to gain more exposure to Chinese assets in a way that helps lower their risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  New product launches have included Weekly Hang Seng Tech Index Options as well as weekly options for 10 individual stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Options, particularly those betting on large tech companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Xiaomi, have dominated the increase in trading, the analysts and investors said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen meaningful pick-up in single stock options activities," said Jason Lui, head of APAC equity and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  By entering into call or put options contracts, investors make leveraged bets on the future price movements of the underlying assets but limit losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Outsized gains in some very large companies have spurred investors to trade single stock options to maximise returns, Lui said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's low-cost artificial intelligence reasoning model DeepSeek and President Xi Jinping's rare meeting with tech entrepreneurs have sent the Hang Seng Index up 17 percent this year. E-commerce giant Alibaba and smartphone and EV maker Xiaomi have surged 50 percent each to lead the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big stock swings often come with high volatility, posing particular risks to the Chinese market, which still faces tariff threats from US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ocean Arete, a Hong Kong-based US$1 billion macro hedge fund, recently boosted its China equity exposure while staying hedged for potential market turbulence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the primary uncertainties we're trying to navigate is the US-China relationship and geopolitics broadly," said Yuexin Zeng, head of investor relations at Ocean Arete.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volatility will "remain higher for longer," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  A volatility gauge tracking the Hang Seng Index hit a two-year high in October and rose again last month when the Hong Kong benchmark skyrocketed to a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hedge fund Aspoon Capital, which generated a 14 percent return in the first two months this year, is adding China tech index put options to hedge the tariff risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do think the market can be too complacent about the tariff now," Aspoon Chief Investment Officer Ryan Yin said in a newsletter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Derivatives trading "absolutely has been strong in the last three to six months for China underlying [assets]," said Nick Silver, head of prime services for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have had to become much more familiar with trading in a choppy and sometimes downward trending market in recent years, he said, "and using derivatives is probably the best, most efficient way to do that." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Automakers were battered on Thursday as stock markets fell on both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump announced significant tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, pressing ahead with tough trade policies many fear will spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Wall Street, the Dow, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broad-based S&P 500 all slipped, with General Motors giving up 7.4 percent and Ford dipping 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Toyota - the world's top-selling carmaker - fell two percent. Honda shed 2.5 percent, Nissan was off 1.7 percent and Mazda dropped six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul-listed Hyundai gave up more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among European auto firms, Volkswagen shed 1.3 percent, Porsche lost 2.6 percent, Mercedes dropped 2.7 percent and BMW fell 2.5 percent, helping to push the Frankfurt DAX index down 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeep maker Stellantis lost more than four percent. India's Tata Motors, which exports Jaguars and Land Rovers to the United States, also lost ground - leading analysts to speculate on where markets may be headed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trade war has escalated, and unsurprisingly, German carmakers are leading the declines or are among the biggest decliners today," said StoneX Group analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst with CMC Markets, added: "While investors see a fair chance for successful negotiations between the European Union and the US in the coming weeks, many prefer to wait for these discussions rather than speculate in advance."
  <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States," Trump said on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rate, which takes effect on April 3 at 12:01 am affects foreign-made cars and light trucks imported into America. The tariffs also apply to auto parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  About half of the cars sold in the United States are made within the country. Of the imported vehicles, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's government called the tariffs "extremely regrettable" while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a "direct attack" on his country's workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  French Finance Minister Eric Lombard warned: "The only solution for the European Union will be to raise tariffs on American products in response."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.4 percent to 42,299, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to 5,693. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 0.5 percent to 17,804. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's auto sector is expected to face "considerable difficulties" when US import tariffs on cars announced by President Donald Trump take effect and the government plans an emergency response by April, the industry minister said.
 <br>
  <br>
  South Korea will also actively engage the US government to explore measures to minimise the negative impact on South Korea's auto companies and suppliers, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun said in a meeting with industry officials on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Global uncertainties are growing but South Korean auto companies will not be fighting alone," Ahn said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government will consider financial assistance, investment support, and help with market diversification, he said, adding that parts suppliers are expected to be hit particularly hard.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles sparked criticism and threats of retaliation from countries affected by the move.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in South Korea's Hyundai Motor shed more than 4 percent and sister automaker Kia Corp fell more than 3 percent. Hyundai Motor shares are set to post their biggest daily drop since late October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai together with affiliate Kia is the world's third-largest automaker by sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, South Korea's exports of automobiles to the United States stood at US$34.7 billion, accounting for 49 percent of its total auto exports. (Reuters)
