<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang has emphasised boosting consumption and improving people's livelihoods through stronger and more targeted measures, in a bid to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in driving economic development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a session held by the State Council, CCTV cited Li saying that, "Boosting consumption is not only an important way to expand domestic demand and stabilise growth, but also a major measure to transform the development model in the mid-to-long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  More efforts should be made to facilitate service consumption, improve the supply of education, medical care, culture, sports, tourism, elderly care and household services, and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence to unlock consumption potential of AI terminal products, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also emphasised the need to relax market access in relevant industries, and boost high-quality product supply to meet emerging consumer demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top policymakers have pledged to try to bolster household incomes and consumption this year. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks dropped on Thursday following disappointing results from Walmart as banking shares fell in a move analysts attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walmart reported quarterly results that met expectations, but shares slid 6.5 percent after its forecast missed expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase fell three percent or more, dragging on major indices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which finished at a record the last two days, dropped 0.4 percent to 6,117.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.0 percent to 44,176, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.5 percent to 19,962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop in banking shares hit stocks that were "very overbought," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments, who noted that major US indices finished above their session lows in spite of significant geopolitical uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's been trouble in the market, buyers have showed up," said Sarhan, who views the dynamic as an indication of underlying bullishness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing slumped 2.8 percent after President Donald Trump said he was looking at "alternatives" to the company's Air Force One operation because of delivery delays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hasbro surged 13 percent after reporting better than expected profits. The toymaker expects 2025 revenues to be "up slightly," it said. (AFP)

    Slight uptick in HK bad loans seen in 2024: BEA

<img alt="The Bank of East Asia delivered a 12 percent increase in its net profits in 2024, to HK$4.6 billion. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792489_1_20250220180623.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of East Asia (BEA) on Thursday said it has been closely monitoring risks related to its exposure to the Hong Kong property sector as there was a slight uptick in so-called "bad loans" last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference reviewing the bank's annual financial results, co-chief executive Adrian Li said about 6 percent of BEA's HK$61.4 billion Hong Kong property loans were non-performing in 2024, up from about 3 percent the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of these loans were in the commercial real estate sector, he said, adding that credit ratings for some of the bank's local clients were downgraded which in turn prompted the bank to significantly increase provision for its local property loans to over HK$1.2 billion, up from HK$380 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of local property loans to the group's total loans, meanwhile, dropped to 11.5 percent at the end of last year, from 13.7 percent at the end of 2023, as the bank gradually reduced its exposure to Hong Kong property due to "relatively high risks" on the commercial side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Li struck a more optimistic tone when it comes to the mainland, saying the risk of bad loans there is stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unwinding of the interest rate cycle should ease pressure on the Chinese real estate sector in the medium term, provided that rates continue their downward trajectory. With the impact of stimulus packages beginning to manifest, confidence is gradually returning improving investors, sentiment and activities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li's remarks came as the bank delivered a 12 percent increase in its overall net profits in the past financial year, rising to HK$4.6 billion from the HK$4.2 billion in 2023 on the back of US interest rate reductions as well as stimulus measures from Beijing and the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.38 per share, more than double that of the year before, bringing the total annual dividend to HK$0.69 per share, up over 27 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Brian Li, the bank's co-chief executive, said the lender has seen a significant increase in demand from mainland customers for wealth management services in the SAR, with the number of mainland clients jumping 60 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That, he said, helped boost revenue from relevant investment products by 28 percent year-on-year.

    'Constructive' talks after China blasts tariffs at WTO

<img alt="The US, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the WTO discussions. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792389_2_20250220104914.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Wednesday that discussions on trade tensions were "constructive", after China accused the US of imposing "tariff shocks" that could upend the global trading system.
 <br>
  <br>
  China condemned tariffs launched or threatened by US President Donald Trump at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday. Washington dismissed China's comments as hypocritical.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on all Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory tariffs and to file a WTO dispute against Washington in what could be an early test of Trump's stance towards the institution.
  <br>
  <br>
  The majority of the six countries that participated in the talks on trade turbulence, put on the agenda by China, raised concern about mounting tensions, but also called for restraint, said WTO spokesperson Ismaila Dieng in a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States, Nicaragua, Namibia, Malaysia, Trinidad and Tobago and Russia took part in the discussions, which were part of broader talks on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The large majority "stressed the importance of upholding WTO principles and values and called for action to preserve the stability and effectiveness of the global trading system", Dieng added.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the first time that mounting trade frictions have been formally addressed on the agenda of the watchdog's top decision-making body, the General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao expressed strong dissatisfaction with US tariffs on Chinese goods in a letter addressed to the newly confirmed US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The move by the US to unilaterally impose tariffs undermined normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US", Wang said in the letter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang also said Beijing was willing to work with Washington to "strengthen dialogue, manage differences, promote cooperation" and hoped to create a "fair and predictable policy environment" for the two countries' business communities to cooperate. (Reuters)

    S&amp;P 500 adds to its record as US stocks drift higher

<img alt="The S&P 500 posts a second straight record following a choppy session amid lingering worries about US tariffs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792388_1_20250220073209.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 added to its record as US stock indexes drifted through a quiet Wednesday on Wall Street.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent after setting an all-time high the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 71 points, or 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite inched up by 0.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 upward. It rose 1.3 percent after saying it had developed what it calls the world’s first “quantum processing unit,” which could lead to the development of much more powerful computers. While the gain was relatively modest, Microsoft's gargantuan size gives its stock's movements huge sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 9.7 percent rally for Analog Devices also helped push the market higher. The semiconductor company reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, despite what CEO Vincent Roche called a “challenging macro and geopolitical backdrop.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla rose 1.8 percent. It climbed after another electric-vehicle company, Nikola, plunged 39.1 percent following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The electric truck maker said it would try to sell off its assets and wind down its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit on Wednesday and edged down to 4.53 percent from 4.55 percent late on Tuesday. It was below 3.70 percent as recently as September and approaching 4.80 percent within the past few weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both the bond and the stock markets have increasingly been taking US President Donald Trump’s tariffs in stride, after earlier showing much more trepidation. The hope on Wall Street is that Trump is using such threats merely as a tool to drive negotiations, and the ultimate effects won’t be as bad as they initially appeared.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes released for the Fed’s last policy meeting in January showed officials discussed how Trump’s proposed tariffs and mass deportations of migrants, as well as strong consumer spending, could push inflation higher this year
  <br>
  <br>
  In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.6 percent after a report showed UK inflation accelerated to a 10-month high. That could put pressure on the Bank of England, which had been cutting interest rates to invigorate its tepid economy. (AP)

 Banking giant HSBC on Wednesday revealed that Hong Kong employees whose roles are related to its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as equity capital market (ECM) businesses could be affected, as it kicks off a fresh round of job cuts worldwide as part of measures to slash costs by US$1.5 billion by the end of 2026.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its new chief executive, George Elhedery, said the group is looking at cutting its global personnel expenses by eight percent over 2025 and 2026, as it withdraws from mergers and acquisitions banking activity in the UK, Europe, and the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at an online press conference, Elhedery refused to say how many jobs will go.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Some of them definitely relate to M&A and the ECM in UK, Europe, and the US. All those supporting this activity will be possibly impacted, but also in these areas of the bank, in particular investment banking, there will be continuous adjustment of the workforce, both to clients, to activities, and to proposition," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say that partly would be a normal course of business, and partly is related to the investment banking decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Pam Kaur, the HSBC's chief financial officer, said that risks related to its Hong Kong property business book has been very low and that the group is expecting a positive outlook for the SAR's real estate industry going forward, following reduced interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The sector has been challenged because of rental prices and interest rates and vacancy levels. However, this year we have seen some positive momentum, both in terms of the volume and the price of property transactions in Hong Kong is increasing," she noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC added that businesses on the mainland remain resilient.

<img alt="HSBC said pre-tax profits rose six percent to $32.3 billion in 2024 as the bank undergoes a structural overhaul. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792282_1_20250219150836.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC posted an annual profit on Wednesday that beat estimates, helped by increased revenue in its wealth and markets businesses.
 <br>
  <br>
  It reported profit before tax for 2024 of US$32.3 billion, a rise of around six percent, as income withstood the impact of falling interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  That compared with US$30.3 billion a year earlier and the US$31.7 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by the bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Asia-focused lender also announced a new US$2 billion share buyback which it plans to complete before next earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figures come against the backdrop of CEO Georges Elhedery embarking on costly restructuring just as the business outlook is muddied by divergence in central bank interest rate policies, with the euro zone having room to cut rates, the US holding steady and Japan expected to raise.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elhedery, who took the helm in September last year, has been taking steps to boost returns and tighten the London-headquartered bank's focus on Asia, where it earns the bulk of its profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said it aimed to generate about US$300 million of cost reductions in 2025, with a commitment to an annualised reduction of US$1.5 billion in cost base expected by the end of 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have renewed vigour in finding the efficiencies that will optimise our resource allocation, be that geographical, business line or balance sheet," Elhedery said in the bank's earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will enhance the way we actively and dynamically manage costs and capital, and target investments." (Agencies)

    China condemns US 'tariff shocks' at WTO

<img alt="Li Chenggang, China's Ambassador to the WTO, warns against what he says is US unilateralism disrupting the rules-based multilateral trading system. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792198_1_20250219060325.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sweeping tariffs threatened or imposed by US President Donald Trump risk triggering inflation, market distortions, and even a global recession, China said on Tuesday at the World Trade Organization.
 <br>
  <br>
  After returning to office on January 20, Trump slapped China, the world's second-biggest economy, with an additional 10 percent levy on products entering the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Trump signed executive orders last week imposing new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The world faces a series of tariff shocks," said Li Chenggang, China's ambassador to the WTO, at the first meeting of the year of the global trade body's decision-making General Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US has imposed or threatened tariffs on its trading partners, including China, unilaterally and arbitrarily, blatantly violating WTO rules. China firmly opposes such measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariff shocks heighten economic uncertainty, disrupt global trade, and risk domestic inflation, market distortion, or even global recession."
  <br>
  <br>
  Li went on to say that US unilateralism threatened to upend the rules-based multilateral trading system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stakes are high for all members, big or small," said Li.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imposing punitive tariffs on countries with high trade surpluses with the United States has been at the heart of Trump's economic policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He paused 25 percent levies against Canada and Mexico for a month after both countries vowed to step up measures to counter flows of the drug fentanyl and the crossing of undocumented migrants into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump went ahead with tariffs on China, which imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting US coal and liquified natural gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Geneva-based trade official said Washington in return voiced concerns that China was operating a non-market economic system and habitually breached WTO rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US highlighted the issues stemming from China's lack of transparency and its disregard for WTO oversight," the official said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US also pointed out that the WTO's current inability to address China's market-distorting policies, such as unfair subsidies, significantly diminishes the organisation's effectiveness." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained at 3.1 percent in the November-January period, unchanged from the previous three-month figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said 3,716,600 were in work in the latest period, a fall of 2,300 from October-December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The labour force, meanwhile, decreased by around 5,700 to 3,826,700.
  <br>
  <br>
  Around 110,100 people were looking for a job, down about 3,500 from the previous three-month period.
  <br>
  <br>
  The underemployment rate also remained unchanged in the three months from November, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun said Hong Kong's jobless rate remains low.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added in a statement that "the labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though uncertainties in the global economy would continue to pose challenges to some businesses."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Australia's central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for the first time since the depths of the 2020 pandemic, saying progress had been made on inflation though it was still cautious about the outlook.
 <br>
  <br>
  Wrapping up its February policy meeting, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to 4.10 percent, ending more than a year of steady policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  It offered little guidance on whether it would ease again at the next board meeting in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had wagered heavily on a quarter-point cut after core inflation surprised on the downside in the fourth quarter at 3.2 percent and looked certain to re-enter the RBA's 2-3 percent target band this quarter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday denied promoting a cryptocurrency that crashed last week, losing investors billions of dollars and prompting a flood of complaints, as prosecutors reportedly prepare an investigation into the scandal.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I did not promote it, I spread it," Milei told broadcaster TN, adding that it "is a problem between private parties because the State does not play a role here."
  <br>
  <br>
  "I acted in good faith," he said.

  Argentina's federal prosecutor's office will examine whether Milei engaged in fraud or criminal association or was in breach of his duties when he praised the $LIBRA cryptocurrency on social media Friday evening, according to news reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The currency's value soared then crashed, and Milei deleted his blessing hours later, saying he had made a mistake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentine economists, crypto specialists and opposition political figures criticised the self-declared "anarcho-capitalist" president, an economist by training, and said the digital asset could be a fraud or a Ponzi scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry observers said the operation was likely a "rug pull" -- a scam where developers unveil a crypto token, attract investors, then quickly cash out.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rights NGO Observatory for the Right to the City, one of several complainants, alleges Milei formed part of a "criminal organisation that organised a fraud with the $LIBRA cryptocurrency that simultaneously affected more than 40,000 people with losses of more than US$4 billion."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Kobeissi Letter, a publication that provides analysis on global capital markets, said on X Friday that within minutes of its launch, "multiple large holders began liquidating MILLIONS of USD worth of $LIBRA."
  <br>
  <br>
  "This included gains of +US$4 million or more as $LIBRA rose to US$4.6 billion in market (capitalisation)," it reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Milei said he had "nothing to hide" from an investigation.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that those who carried out the transactions, including "a lot of bots," were people who "knew very well what the risk was."
  <br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, former president and opposition figure Cristina Kirchner called Milei a "crypto-scammer" and opposition parliamentarians announced they would institute impeachment proceedings against him.
  <br>
  <br>
  Any such proceedings would be highly unlikely to succeed, however, as they would require a two-thirds majority in the lower house.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other parties are seeking the creation of a special parliamentary commission to question Milei. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese AI app DeepSeek will not be available to download in South Korea pending a review of its handling of user data, authorities in Seoul said Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a number of countries have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Personal Information Protection Commission said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was carried out.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "acknowledged that considerations for domestic privacy laws were somewhat lacking", the data protection agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It assessed that bringing the app into line with local privacy laws "would inevitably take a significant amount of time", the agency added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To prevent further concerns from spreading, the commission recommended that DeepSeek temporarily suspend its service while making the necessary improvements," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has "accepted" that proposal, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry experts have said the Hangzhou-based firm has embraced a more accessible, opensource approach towards AI development, fostering collaboration and experimentation that could lead to faster breakthroughs.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also said the firm has unveiled large language models challenging the dominate tools developing by its US rivals, but at a lower cost. (AFP & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called for efforts to promote the healthy and high-quality development of China's private sector.
 <br>
  <br>
  He made the remarks when attending a symposium on private enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi said the private sector enjoys broad prospects and great potential on the new journey in the new era, and it is a prime time for private enterprises and entrepreneurs to give full play to their capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also called for efforts to reach consensus and firming up confidence, to promote the healthy and high-quality development of the private sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that all private enterprises and private entrepreneurs will have the ambition to serve the country, strive for development, operate in accordance with the law and promote common prosperity, so as to make new and greater contributions to promoting Chinese-style modernisation," Xi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that policies regarding the private sector would not change.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president delivered the speech after listening to representatives of private companies at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang were among those attending the symposium, which was presided over by Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference chairman Wang Huning.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources, that Xi planned to chair a symposium to boost private sector sentiment, a meeting which would be attended by the country's business leaders, including Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium would be aimed at boosting private-sector sentiment, and Xi was expected to encourage company chiefs to expand their businesses domestically and internationally.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xi first chaired a high-profile symposium for the private sector in 2018. At the time, he pledged tax cuts and a level playing field while reaffirming that private firms would have access to financial backing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The symposium also comes as DeepSeek's AI platform has triggered investor speculation about its potential to buoy China's broader tech sector, leading to calls for an upward repricing of Chinese assets. (Xinhua & agencies)

    OpenAI board rejects Elon Musk-led buyout offer

<img alt="OpenAI's board said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to purchase the company. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791762_1_20250215151723.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 OpenAI's board chairman on Friday said it has unanimously rejected an Elon Musk-led offer to buy the hot artificial intelligence company for US$97.4 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  "OpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk's latest attempt to disrupt his competition," chairman of the board Bret Taylor said in a statement posted by the company on Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Any potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity," the statement continued.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk filed court documents on Wednesday saying that he would withdraw the offer to buy OpenAI if its board returns the artificial intelligence pioneer to a non-profit "charity" model.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI currently operates a hybrid structure, as a non-profit with a money-making subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The change to a for-profit model, one that Altman considers crucial for the company's development, had exacerbated ongoing tensions with Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk and Altman were among the 11-person team that founded OpenAI in 2015, with the former providing initial funding of US$45 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Three years later, Musk departed the company, with OpenAI citing "a potential future conflict for Elon... as Tesla continues to become more focused on AI."
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk established his own artificial intelligence company called xAI early in 2023 after OpenAI ignited global fervor over the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The massive costs of designing, training, and deploying AI models have compelled OpenAI to seek a new corporate structure that would give investors equity and provide more stable governance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The transition to a traditional for-profit company requires approval from California and Delaware authorities, who will scrutinize how the non-profit arm of OpenAI is valued when it becomes a shareholder in the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Current investors prefer a lower valuation to maximize their share of the new company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Critics say Musk's bid, valuing the OpenAI non-profit at US$97.4 billion - approximately US$30 billion above the level in current negotiations, according to The Information - appears designed to disrupt the company's fundraising efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  OpenAI's Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane has said Musk's offer came from a competitor "who has struggled to keep up with the technology and compete with us in the marketplace". (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street closed mixed, with the S&P 500 barely changed, but the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791725_1_20250215072352.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gains in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq Composite on Friday, but other major indices were either down or barely changed as investors digested President Trump's latest tariff announcement, economic data and earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4 percent at 44,546.08, the S&P 500 was flat, finishing at 6,114.63 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 percent to 20,026.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest official figures showed that US retail sales fell by a more-than-expected 0.9 percent in January from December, but analysts noted that this partly reflected an upward revision to the December figure.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop was also partly due to bad weather that depressed demand, and could also show "a little consumer fatigue," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors largely shrugged off data earlier this week showing an increase in consumer price inflation and higher-than-expected wholesale price inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The stock market continues to maintain this resilient disposition," said O'Hare, who pointed to strong corporate earnings as an offset to concerns about tariffs and an uptick in inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But a rebound in inflation, or persistent inflation at a high level, would make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to cut rates further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets also continued to follow the latest trade developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Union on Friday vowed to respond "firmly and immediately" to trade barriers after Trump unveiled tariffs that could hit US allies and competitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he had decided to impose reciprocal duties, in a dramatic escalation of an international trade war he has unleashed since taking office in January, but the measures will not go into effect until a study is completed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite rising trade tensions, investor sentiment has largely held up in the hope that many of the tariffs can be rowed back with negotiations, while Trump's announcement of plans to hold Ukraine peace talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has added some optimism.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariff ambiguity still reigns but markets are currently drawing some comfort from the news" of the delay, said National Australia Bank's head of currencies research and markets, Ray Attrill. (AFP)

    Baidu to make latest Ernie AI model open-source

<img alt="Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791606_1_20250214121337.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Search engine giant Baidu said on Friday it would make its next-generation artificial intelligence model Ernie open-source from June 30, a major shift in strategy as competition heats up.
 <br>
  <br>
  Baidu CEO Robin Li had long advocated for closed-source models as the only viable path for AI development, but the advent of DeepSeek has upended the sector. The startup offers open-source AI services that it claims are comparable in performance to US pioneer OpenAI's advanced systems but come with a lower operational cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  Keen to increase market share, Baidu also announced on Thursday that it would make its AI chatbot Ernie Bot free starting April 1, about a year and a half after introducing premium versions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu was among the first big Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, its Ernie large language model has struggled to gain widespread adoption. Baidu has said its current version, Ernie 4.0, matches OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance's Doubao chatbot has the most active monthly users on the mainland with 78.6 million, DeepSeek has 33.7 million while Ernie Bot has 13 million, according to January data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will gradually launch the Ernie 4.5 series in the coming months and officially open-source it from June 30," Baidu said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li appeared to have changed tack on open-source development, telling attendees at an event in Dubai this week that it could accelerate AI adoption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you open things up, a lot of people will be curious enough to try it. This will help spread the technology much faster," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Baidu also plans to launch a new next-generation model, Ernie 5, in the second half of 2025, a person familiar with the matter has said. (Reuters)

 US markets ended higher on Thursday, powered by gains in tech related stocks, with the S&P 500 leading the charge.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia, Apple and Tesla all rose after President Trump unveiled a roadmap for charging reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said the tariffs would match the higher duties charged by other countries and could be imposed within weeks as Trump's trade and economic team studies bilateral tariff and trade relationships.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks also gained after data showed US producer prices increased in January, while key elements in the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a measure closely tracked by the US Federal Reserve, were benign or lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 1.04 percent to end at 6,115.07. It was the S&P 500's largest one-day gain since January 15.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq gained 1.50 percent to 19,945.64, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.77 percent to 44,711.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla jumped 5.9 percent, Nvidia climbed 3.2 percent and Apple rose 2 percent, lifting the S&P 500 to just short of its record high close on January 23.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equity investors are taking cues from the bond market," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital. "Investors were also preparing for kind of an alarmingly high inflation number, based on tariffs." (Reuters)

<img alt="China's Iron and Steel Association said the tariff rise on steel and aluminum imports to the US would adversely impact the supply chain of the global steel industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A group representing China's steel industry has warned that a new 25 percent tariff on imports of the product into the United States would have an "adverse impact" on the sector, state media reported on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism," the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, the impact on (China's) steel exports is limited," the CISA said in the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing (China's) steel export competitiveness," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite being the world's top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  But with demand slumping in the domestic construction sector, Chinese steel exports have surged, spurring concerns in Washington about overcapacity in foreign markets with harmful effects on US producers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a medium- and long-term perspective, the (US) increase in tariffs will have an adverse impact on industrial and supply chains in the global steel industry, including the Chinese steel industry," CISA deputy secretary-general Zhang Longqiang said, according to CCTV. (AFP)

    Honda-Nissan merger talks called off

<img alt="Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan say they are dropping their talks on business integration. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791472_1_20250213154051.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan on Thursday confirmed they had scrapped merger talks announced in December, bringing an end to a tie-up that would have created the world's third-largest automaker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firms said in a joint statement that they "agreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The firms' intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla and Chinese firms in the electric vehicle market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda's CEO insisted in December that it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local media reports have said the discussions unravelled after Honda proposed to make its struggling rival a subsidiary instead of the plan, announced in December, to integrate under a new holding company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda "proposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding company... to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchange".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As a result of these discussions, both companies concluded that, to prioritise speed of decision-making and execution of management measures in an increasingly volatile market environment heading into the era of electrification, it would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They will, however, continue to "collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companies," it added. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly fell on Wednesday following US inflation data that further clouded the prospects for additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index rose to 3.0 percent in January from a year ago, above the 2.8 percent projected by economists, raising questions about whether the Fed's progress on bringing down prices was reversing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel that the figures reinforced the central bank's recent cautious approach to interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.5 percent at 44,368, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3 percent at 6,051.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Nasdaq, which fell in the morning, finished with a modest gain at 19,649.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities were a lot more resilient than I would have expected given the news we had this morning," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides inflation, markets have also been on edge over President Trump's tariff plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, CVS Health shot up 15 percent following better-than-expected earnings. The pharmacy chain company projected higher profits in 2025 compared with last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gilead Sciences jumped 7.5 percent after reporting results that beat expectations as it signaled it could launch its latest HIV prevention drug in the summer of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chevron fell 1.6 percent after announcing it will cut 15 to 20 percent of its workforce as part of a reorganisation to save money and to position the oil giant for the long term. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mixed on Tuesday following a choppy session as markets weighed the latest White House tariff actions and Federal Reserve commentary.
 <br>
  <br>
  US trading partners expressed dismay and vowed retaliation to President Donald Trump's latest move – a plan to enact 25 percent tariffs on imported aluminium and steel from March 12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in congressional testimony that the US central bank was in no hurry to adjust monetary policy, leaving a cloudy outlook for additional interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three of the major US indices had opened lower, but the Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,593.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was essentially flat at 6,068, while the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent to 19,643.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market's ability to avoid a major selloff amid the tariff uncertainty reflected "underlying optimism" about economic conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Coca-Cola jumped 4.7 percent after reporting an 11 percent increase in profits to US$2.2 billion in results that topped estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple gained 2.2 percent following a report that it partnered with Alibaba on artificial intelligence in China. Alibaba rose 1.3 percent.

    'US steel tariffs may have limited impact on China'

<img alt="The volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018. File photo: Xinhua" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1791212_1_20250211193225.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst on Tuesday said while United States president Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs are expected to have a limited direct impact on China, countries such as the US' neighbours of Canada and Mexico will feel the pinch.
 <br>
  <br>
  The comment came after Trump on Monday announced a 25-percent import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US "with no exception". The measures take effect on March 4.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vivian Yang, senior analyst at Chinese steel data provider, MySteel, told RTHK that the move will have limited impact on China's steel sector, as Beijing has already shifted away from the US market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018 when Trump announced an earlier round of steel tariffs. Only some 891,000 tonnes of steel were exported to the US from China last year, accounting for 0.8 percent of the nation's total steel exports in 2024, according to MySteel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang said nations including Canada, Mexico and Brazil will be hit the hardest as they are currently the US’ top suppliers of the two metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Canada may face greater economic recursion as the tariffs could lead to increased production costs and potential job losses in the Canadian steel and aluminium sectors," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the Shanghai-based analyst warned that the new tariffs will still have an impact on China's "indirect" steel exports, such as automobiles, ships, and machinery.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The White House had already imposed a 10 percent additional on all Chinese goods imports. And if Trump's targeted tariffs of up to 60 percent on all Chinese imports he claimed earlier is to be realised, the impact on Chinese manufactured goods would be huge, because almost all Chinese exported products would lose their price advantage and have no export profit," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although China is exporting very little steel to the US directly nowadays, some Chinese steel products do make their way into the US by other channels, for example, some are purchased by foreign countries and re-shipped to the US, [so] these transshipment practices will be impacted," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland steel-related shares declined following the latest tariff announcements, with iron and steel manufacturing conglomerates Hesteel Group and Angang Steel's stocks falling over two percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs.
  <br>
  <br>
  In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong.

    US slaps 25 percent tariffs on steel, aluminum

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent "without exceptions or exemptions", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We actually have a surplus," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminium to be "smelted and cast" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.
  <br>
  <br>
  As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: "I don't mind."
  <br>
  <br>
  Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)

    Chinese businesses shrug off Trump tariffs

<img alt="Yiwu city is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790966_1_20250210090937.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Traders in China's export manufacturing hub of Yiwu shrugged off US President Donald Trump's tariffs and moves against China on Sunday, with some saying they made preparations to soften the blow.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yiwu city in eastern Zhejiang province is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items, exporting products ranging from Christmas trees to costume jewellery globally, including to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We predicted that he would assume power," Cheng Haodong, chairman of Beisi Group, a business which sells clothes to water bottles, told Reuters from their office in the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After he assumed power, ok, how do we want to adjust? Actually it was prepared for in advance," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They monitored information on overseas social media sites, he added, which led to them establishing a new factory for producing liquid laundry detergent in the US state of Tennessee in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's campaign promised 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports before he was elected. However, he revised that to 10 percent after taking office, which took effect on Tuesday. He also plans to cancel duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This time actually the shock won't be too big for us,” said Cheng, who declined to provide detailed figures on sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beisi exports to other businesses abroad, but also sells some of its products directly to US consumers through online platforms such as Temu and Shein, low-priced shopping sites that analysts expect will be hard hit by Trump's repeal of the 'de minimis' rule - a trade loophole that allowed low-value imports to enter the country duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  Similar sentiments were shared by traders and buyers in the sprawling market in the city, where many were just returning to work after the end of the eight-day Lunar New Year break.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(Even if) you increase (the tariff) to 50 percent it won't have any effect on us," said Zeng Hao, owner of Jinqi Wanju which sells toys such as brightly-coloured dinosaur figurines.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was because the products are highly profitable and his firm could absorb some of the tariff burden, he said. Companies down the supply chain also have reason to increase their own prices, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abby Jin, who buys products in Yiwu on behalf of other customers in markets such as the US, Australia and the Middle East, said vendors in the city were not short of orders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We can respond by slighting reducing our profit margins or adjusting costs. In the end, the additional costs will be passed on to the end consumers in their country, meaning they will ultimately bear the consequences of their own economic policies,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For the US, whether they can find a suitable country to replace us (as a trade partner) is a question they need to consider themselves." (Reuters)

    Trump to announce new steel, aluminium tariffs

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will introduce new 25-percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, on top of existing metals duties, in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them," Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management," Trump said of US Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
  <br>
  <br>
  Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of steelmakers in Asia mostly fell on Monday, save for those with operations in the United States. The US dollar rose and US Treasury yields ticked higher. (Agencies)

<img alt="People walk in an alley near a popular shopping street in Beijing during the Spring Festival holiday. Officials say an increase in the consumer price index in January is due largely to the influence of the new year break.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, accelerated to its fastest in five months, government data showed on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the CPI was up 0.5 percent year on year last month, up from the 0.1 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Trump pauses de minimis repeal on Chinese imports

<img alt="President Trump's ban had created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790798_1_20250208113211.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce," said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The United States added fewer jobs than expected in January; although hiring remained healthy, government data showed on Friday, marking resilience in the labour market heading into President Donald Trump's new term.
 <br>
  <br>
  Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has "a lot of work to do."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy," added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.
  <br>
  <br>
  They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump made tariffs a key platform of his presidential campaign. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790769_1_20250208043942.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries," Trump said. "We don't want any more, any less."
  <br>
  <br>
  The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower on fears of a possible trade war, with investors also concerned by the latest US unemployment data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790781_1_20250208083003.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US and European shares fell Friday, with the latest US jobs report and higher inflation expectations capping the end of a volatile week marked by concerns over a trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data showed the United States added fewer jobs than expected in January while unemployment ticked down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobs data missed expectations, but Wall Street's three main indexes initially rose. They quickly fell into the red, however, after separate data showed US consumers now expect inflation to jump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down one percent at 44,303.40, the S&P 500 also lost one percent to 6,025.99 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 percent to finish at 19,523.40.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Trump's remarks on unspecified "reciprocal tariffs" also appeared to reignite concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he was "probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday," saying that this would be "opposed to a flat-fee tariff" approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today's (jobs) data does not show a large enough divergence from expectations to shift what is expected to be the Fed's next rate move," said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Still the Fed is expected to cut the Fed Funds rate twice this year and today's data does not really give a hint into when the first cut will be," Stanzl said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed kept its rate unchanged last week, with chair Jerome Powell saying the central bank was in no "hurry" to adjust borrowing costs again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Labor Department said total US employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, which was significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January figure was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000 according to Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think that the labour market data shifts the dial for the Fed," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  But data released afterward subsequently showed US consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in July, with survey respondents reporting feeling less confident and more concerned about inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 4.3 percent, up a full percentage point from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such a substantial one-month rise of one percentage point or more has occurred only five times in the past 14 years," noted Axel Rudolph, Senior Technical Analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jump in inflation expectations follows a turbulent week for stock markets and currencies after Trump imposed tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US leader also warned that the European Union would face tariffs "pretty soon" while he delayed duties on Canada and Mexico at the 11th hour. (AFP)

    'Chinese e-commerce firms can prevail despite tariffs'

<img alt="E-commerce businesses such as Shein or Temu must adopt long-term shipping planning to offset the additional duties imposed by the US, analysts say. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790724_1_20250207185909.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese e-commerce companies would still be able to maintain healthy financial positions in the face of surging US tariffs - if they fine tune their business models with long-term planning, according to analysts.
 <br>
  <br>
  This came after the US on Monday revoked a long-standing de minimis rule that allowed packages worth less than US$800 to enter the country duty-free, as part of measures when US President Donald Trump signed the executive order to impose an extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The changes, while slapping additional duties on Chinese e-commerce firms such as Temu and Shein, could still offer an opportunity for them, if they conduct shipping planning intelligently, according to Catherine Lim, a senior consumer analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Bear in mind that some of these [de minimis shipments] are very random parcels that did not require inventory planning about shipping, like what most export-oriented products do, particularly those above the US$800 threshold," Lim told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The biggest change I would say right now for these e-commerce sellers who are using the de minimis is that they need to adopt longer-term planning. They need to start restructuring themselves so much so that they will have enough goods ahead of time at Temu's or Shein's specified warehouses, while still being in a position to actually distribute to the local consumers, to meet the demand of the US shoppers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That will offset the entire financial impact from the tariff hikes."
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the ways, she suggested, was for the mainland firms to shift away from aviation transport which is around 25 to 30 times more expensive than sea freight.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lim said she believes there still could be turnarounds in terms of the trade policies from the US, as supply chain management processes undertake new regulations while authorities from China and the US, as well as the rest of the world, take steps to address the new procedures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go through a rather volatile couple of months, but this is temporary," Lim said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Into the second half of the year, I am expecting, barring any unforeseen changes to trade policies that this will start to stabilise into the end of the year."

<img alt="Amazon is on track to invest more than US$100 billion on cloud computing and artificial intelligence in 2025. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790640_1_20250207094326.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Amazon reported strong earnings on Thursday but, like its big tech peers Microsoft and Google, saw its stock price fall on concerns over high AI investment costs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The mounting expenses of data-intensive artificial intelligence and its infrastructure have cast a shadow over this earnings season, with only Facebook owner Meta winning Wall Street's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's stock surged 18 percent in January as investors endorsed its AI strategy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's AWS cloud division, along with rivals Microsoft and Google, are investing heavily in AI data centres while meaningful returns remain uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon CEO Andy Jassy defended the spending, saying the company was on track to spend US$100 billion on capital expenditure in 2025, with the "vast majority" on AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The emergence of China's lower-cost DeepSeek model has raised questions about such massive spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite US government efforts to maintain AI dominance through export controls on advanced chips, DeepSeek has achieved comparable results using authorised, less sophisticated Nvidia semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft, leading the generative AI revolution through its OpenAI partnership, plans to invest about US$80 billion in AI this fiscal year.
  <br>
  <br>
  And while it has rapidly deployed AI features under its Gemini brand, Google's Cloud revenue missed expectations, despite growing 30 percent to US$12 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google also announced plans for US$75 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, surprising analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon on Thursday reported its fourth-quarter net income doubled to US$20 billion, with net sales rising 10 per cent to US$187.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  AWS remained profitable with sales growing 19 percent to US$28.8 billion, though slightly below market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Amazon's shares dropped more than five per cent in after-hours trading, mirroring reactions to Microsoft and Google's results - strong profits overshadowed by concerns about AI spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon's forecast of five to nine per cent growth for the first quarter of 2025, with sales between US$151 billion and US$155.5 billion, also fell short of expectations and weighed on the stock price. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended higher, while the Dow closed lower after a choppy trading session on Thursday, as investors studied earnings reports while awaiting Amazon's results after the bell and a key jobs report on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Drugmaker Eli Lilly rose after the company forecast annual profit largely above estimates, while fashion house Tapestry jumped on an annual sales and profit forecast increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  Philip Morris International advanced after the cigarette maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and forecast 2025 profit above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com ticked up ahead of its quarterly earnings report. Investors will look for updates on its artificial intelligence investments, after Chinese startup DeepSeek's cheaper AI model sharpened investor scrutiny of US tech giants' massive spending on the technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today, the main focus is corporate earnings. Tariffs are in the background," said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Amazon will be the sixth of the Magnificent Seven to report. The AI theme has been under quite a lot of volatility over the last few weeks with the DeepSeek news ... We’re watching tonight for any thoughts that (Amazon) has to say around that," Hill said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honeywell fell after the industrial and aerospace giant said it would split into three independently listed companies and forecast downbeat sales and profit for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 22.09 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,083.57, the Nasdaq Composite gained 99.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,791.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.65 points, or 0.3 percent to 44,747.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets saw a dismal start to the week when President Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs over the weekend, before suspending the levies on goods from Mexico and Canada on Monday for a month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The January nonfarm payrolls report is due later on Friday, a crucial metric in gauging the state of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's rate path.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders don't expect the Fed to adjust interest rates in its next meeting in March, but a cut is widely anticipated in June. (Reuters)

    Honda-Nissan merger in doubt: sources

<img alt="Sources said a potential deal between the two Japanese auto giants was looking less likely. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790552_1_20250206174612.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nissan CEO Makoto Uchida met with his Honda counterpart Toshihiro Mibe on Thursday to say he wanted to end their merger talks after the larger automaker proposed making Nissan a subsidiary, said a source with knowledge of the matter.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Japanese automakers in December signed a memorandum of understanding to discuss an integration under a holding company to create the world's third largest automaker and compete in an increasingly tough industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the talks have been complicated by growing differences, multiple people familiar with the matter have told international media, and hit a wall after Honda said it wanted to turn Nissan into a subsidiary.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A consensus was reached (on Nissan's side) that the talks cannot proceed under that proposal," said the source with knowledge of the discussions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan will formalise the decision to withdraw from the MOU at a board meeting to be held before the company's third-quarter earnings announcement next week, the source added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda's current stance is it would not accept an integration unless Nissan agrees to become a subsidiary, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda is Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota, and Nissan is the third-largest.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan and Honda spokespeople declined to comment on the status of their talks, repeating earlier statements that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February.
  <br>
  <br>
  A scrapping of the talks raises questions about how Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan, can ride out its latest crisis without external help. Nissan has already announced plans to cut 9,000 workers and 20 percent of global capacity. (Reuters)

    'Removal of de minimis exemption a blow for retailers'

<div class="itemFullText">
 The scrapping of America’s de minimis exemption for the import of small goods will deal a blow to small cross-border retailers, increase burdens on consumers, while shaking Hong Kong's status as an international logistics centre, according to analysts and industry insiders.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the White House announced it would end the de minimis exemption which allowed low-value packages, under US$800, to be shipped to America duty-free.
  <br>
  <br>
  The end of the exemption was a result of the additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The removal of the exemption means that goods from Chinese retailers, especially e-commerce players like Shein and Temu, are now subject to the additional US duties on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme on Thursday, Alan Lung, political analyst and co-convenor of The Path of Democracy, said the removal of the exemption would affect the SAR as well as small mainland shippers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of the small parcels that are shipped through e-traders, like Temu and Shein, are shipped through Hong Kong. The scrapping of the US$800 exemption simply increases the costs to consumers and makes it more complicated for custom clearances," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Companies like Alibaba are not really affected because their warehouses in the US, and they have their own customs clearances in blocks, it's the smaller shippers that will go bust," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Platforms like Shein and Temu have become enormously popular in the US in recent years due to their budget-friendly products, and a US congressional report showed that over 80 percent of American e-commerce shipments in 2022 were from de minimis imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lung, Aditya Halan, Chief Technology Officer at Floship, an e-commerce and logistics service provider based in the SAR, said on the same programme that some logistics companies in the region have already increased their fees - due to the tariff changes and general business uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot is changing by the day. So everybody is trying to be secure... to put on a random block on the amount, and we commit as we pay back as actuals later on," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Halan also warned that such tariff hikes could hinder the SAR's status as a global logistics centre in the long term, as brands look for ways to manufacture their products elsewhere, away from the mainland, to skip the tariff duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the brands start manufacturing outside China, the logistics will follow that trend as well, so many people will start setting up logistics hubs elsewhere, then there will be a risk for Hong Kong as a logistic centre.”

    Nissan calls off Honda merger talks, Nikkei says

<img alt="Honda and Nissan said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790418_2_20250206060147.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nissan is set to call off merger talks with rival Honda, a source said on Wednesday, abandoning a US$60 billion-plus tie-up that would have created the world's number 3 automaker and raising questions about how it will drive a turnaround by itself.
 <br>
  <br>
  Talks have been complicated by growing differences between the two Japanese automakers, two people familiar with the matter, both of whom declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan shares slid more than 4 percent on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which temporarily suspended trading in the stock after a Nikkei business daily report that it would pull out. Honda shares continued to trade and finished the day up more than 8 percent, in a sign of apparent investor relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  The development will raise fresh questions about how hard-hit Nissan, which is in the middle of a turnaround plan and aims to cut 9,000 employees and 20 percent of global capacity, can ride out its latest crisis without external help.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Japan's second-largest car maker behind Toyota , and Nissan, its third-largest, said in December they were in talks to create the world's third-largest automaker by sales, bulking up in an industry facing a huge threat from China's BYD and other electric vehicle entrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reuters reported earlier that Nissan could call off talks after Honda had sounded it out about becoming a subsidiary. Nissan baulked because this was a departure from what was originally framed as a merger of equals, one source said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan and Honda said in separate statements that the Nikkei report was not based on information announced by the companies and that they aimed to finalise a future direction by mid-February and announce it at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, whose market value of about 7.92 trillion yen (US$51.90 billion) is more than five times bigger than Nissan at 1.44 trillion yen, was increasingly worried about its smaller rival's progress on the turnaround plan, said a second source.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tie-up talks have coincided with disruption posed by potential tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Tariffs against Mexico would be more painful for Nissan than for Honda or Toyota, analysts say.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors may get concerned about Nissan's future (and) turnaround," said Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun, adding: "Nissan also has a larger risk exposure to US-Mexico tariffs than Honda and Toyota." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished higher on Wednesday, propelled by resurgent optimism about AI, and fading concern about the economic threat posed by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones rose 0.7 percent to 44,873, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to close at 6,061.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq edged up 0.2 percent to 19,692, held down by a 7.3 percent fall in the share price of Google's parent company Alphabet following disappointing quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  There was some good news for companies linked to the artificial intelligence revolution, after Alphabet's pledge to invest US$75 billion in capital expenditure related to AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market has kind of separated out the weakness seen in Alphabet as sort of just an Alphabet issue," said Briefing.com's Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You take that big CapEx number and that's a little bit staggering, obviously," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If they're going to spend 75 billion dollars in 2025, that should be pretty good for, you know, a company like Nvidia," he added, referring to the major chip designer whose shares closed up 5.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move had "helped energise the AI trade a bit," he added. (AFP)

    Toyota raises annual net profit and sales forecasts

<img alt="Toyota Motor raised its full-year operating profit and sales forecast for 2024. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790356_1_20250205143310.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese auto giant Toyota hiked its annual net profit and sales forecasts for the 2024 financial year on Wednesday, saying it now expects net profit of 4.52 trillion yen (US$29.5 billion), up from 3.57 trillion yen.
 <br>
  <br>
  The "upward revision incorporates progress in strengthening earning power, backed by improvement efforts including product competitiveness", the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revision reflected efforts to strengthen its earnings power through keeping a lid on incentives, raising prices and stabilising production, Toyota said in presentation materials. It also expects to gain from a weak yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota made the revision even though it posted weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter for which it booked its second successive quarterly profit decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operating profit for the three months through December totalled 1.22 trillion yen, down 28 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent quarters, Toyota's profit was pushed higher by strong hybrid vehicle demand in the US and other major markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  By region, operating income in North America, which includes its top market by vehicle sales, the United States, fell by 63 percent over the first nine months of the financial year mainly due to a decrease in sales volume and higher personnel-related costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Operating income in China also declined during that period, pressured by higher marketing costs as the automaker sought to retain market share amid heavy competition from Chinese EV brands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota said it would establish a wholly owned company in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its luxury Lexus brand, with production set to start in 2027 and have an initial capacity of around 100,000 units a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, Toyota reported global group unit sales of 10.8 million vehicles for 2024, making it the world's best-selling automaker for a fifth successive year. (Agencies)

    Businesses are prepared for latest US tariffs: HKGCC

<img alt="The HKGCC says businesses in Hong Kong are relatively prepared for the latest round of US tariffs. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1790318_1_20250205101402.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Businesses in Hong Kong are prepared for the latest round of 10 percent tariffs that Washington imposed on Beijing, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC).
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme on Wednesday, HKGCC CEO Patrick Yeung said the new tariffs would affect the region, as they could disrupt global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But in recent years, Hong Kong's exports have actually become very diversified, and the markets that Hong Kong exporters deal with has also been expanded," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So in this context, we believe that the Hong Kong export sector is already relatively prepared, at least psychologically, because President Trump has already said that there will be a tariff war, and it's just started right now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yeung noted with the SAR expanding into new markets, particularly Asean and the Middle East, and achieving positive growth, it has partially helped offset the decline in trade due to the imposition of US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hunter Chan, Greater China economist at Standard Chartered, told the same show that compared to the previous trade war that took place during Trump's first presidency, Chinese exporters are more prepared this time round.
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects the tariffs to cause a drop of about one percentage point in Chinese GDP in the coming 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economist noted that some Chinese exporters to the US have relocated their factories overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  They have also re-exported to other places to avoid tariffs, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said while market sentiment remains cautious, investors are still hoping there will be positive results from any potential talks between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, shrugging off early weakness while embracing President Trump's moves to delay tariffs on Canada and Mexico and taking in stride China's retaliation to US levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said it was imposing levies on imports of US energy, vehicles and equipment after Trump's 10 percent tariffs came into effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth said markets were taking a "wait and see" view of Trump's trade policy, while regarding earnings as "a positive tailwind."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones gained 0.3 percent to 44,556.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 6,037, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 19,654.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan pointed to a more than 20 percent surge in Palantir Technologies that helped boost the Nasdaq.
  <br>
  <br>
  The technology company scored a 36 percent jump in revenues based on artificial intelligence growth as its CEO described Palantir as a "software juggernaut."
  <br>
  <br>
  Estee Lauder slumped 16.1 percent after announcing plans to cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs through the end of 2026 as part of a corporate reorganisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  PepsiCo dropped 4.5 percent as it reported flat quarterly sales while the soda and snacks giant works to address "subdued" demand in North America and faces "business disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in certain international markets," as CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a news release. (AFP)
