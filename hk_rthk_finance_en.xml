    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<img alt="The United States opens an investigation into China's policies for its semiconductor industry. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784775_2_20241224090533.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets shook off early weakness and pushed higher on Monday, propelled by gains in Nvidia and some other large tech equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had been under pressure early amid concerns over higher US Treasury bond yields that impede year-end gains in a historically strong period of the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stocks didn't really have any direction in the morning, then we got this tech rally that just sort of drifted higher all day," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.2 percent at 42,906.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,974.07, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.0 percent to 19,764.89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks dropped last week after the Federal Reserve signalled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the market rose progressively in a quiet session with analysts pointing to low pre-holiday trading volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among economic releases, US consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in December amid concerns over the potential economic drag of new tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consumer confidence index slipped to 104.7 in December, down from a revised 112.8 last month, The Conference Board announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualcomm climbed 3.5 percent after a jury sided with it in a legal dispute with Arm over alleged breach of license agreements connected to Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. Arm Holdings fell 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordstrom fell 1.6 percent after Mexican investment group El Puerto de Liverpool and members of the Nordstrom family reached a deal that involves taking the department store chain private. The transaction is valued at US$6.25 billion, Nordstrom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will have a half session on Tuesday, Christmas Eve, followed by Wednesday's holiday. (AFP)

    Stellantis backtracks over planned Jeep layoffs

<img alt="Stellantis brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784548_1_20241222073225.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stellantis confirmed on Saturday it was reversing a decision to lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep plant in the US state of Ohio, following the ouster of embattled chief executive Carlos Tavares.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No employees will be placed on indefinite layoff on January 5, 2025, due to the previously announced shift reduction. Employees are expected to return to work as scheduled after the new year," a Stellantis spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes as "Stellantis continues to reassess its strategy in North America," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automaker had announced the job cuts at the plant in Toledo, Ohio in early November, saying it was part of an effort to "regain its competitive edge" amid struggles with falling sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, a 14-brand group that includes Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat, had planned to trim operations at the Toledo South Assembly Plant from two shifts to one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 400 employees were to be transferred to a "third-party service provider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis sales sank in the third quarter, with a 42 percent drop in North America alone. The group offered promotional deals as US dealerships struggled to reduce their inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stellantis has significantly revised its approach since Tavares's December 1 exit, with the new interim CEO giving guarantees to the French and Italian governments on maintaining its production and investments in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French-Italian-American company had 258,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2003. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784456_1_20241221074028.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets rebounded on Friday following a pullback in US Treasury yields as markets braced for a looming US government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reading came in lower than expected, prompting a pullback in US Treasury bond yields that had risen after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled earlier this week they expect fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,930.85, up 1.1 percent for the day but down about two percent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 percent to 42,840.26 and the Nasdaq Composite: was up1.0 percent at 19,572.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen a nice rebound from what was, in our view, an overreaction to the Fed's outlook on Wednesday," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones, pointing to Friday's inflation data as a supportive factor for equities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields pulled back following comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, who expressed confidence that the PCE data showed that inflation was returning to the Fed's target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next 12 to 18 months, rates can still go down a fair amount," Goolsbee told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also keeping watch on developments in Capitol Hill.
  <br>
  <br>
  US lawmakers raced to stave off a government shutdown set to bite within hours after Donald Trump and Elon Musk sabotaged a bipartisan agreement that would have averted a shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  If no deal is struck, the government will cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stocks finished the day lower although they cut their losses as Wall Street rebounded, with data showing tepid retail sales in the UK in the runup to Christmas dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Nike dipped 0.2 percent as it reported lower earnings while new CEO Elliott Hill outlined steps to get the slumping sports giant back on track. Analysts pointed to Nike's near-term outlook, which suggests a turnaround will not be quick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carnival jumped 6.4 percent following an upbeat 2025 forecast that included a 20 percent rise in profits to $2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose for a second straight month in November according to government data published on Friday, although the increase came in a touch below expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, and 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, headline prices rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was slightly below the median forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, triggering a sharp sell-off in the financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent US central bank is responsible for tackling inflation and unemployment, largely by hiking or lowering interest rates to affect demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This indirectly impacts the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, affecting everything from mortgages to car loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, the core PCE price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and by 0.1 percent from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both figures were slightly below expectations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Thursday as Treasury bond yields climbed further in the wake of a Federal Reserve decision that prompted deep selling in the prior session.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices bounced early in the day, but the rebound faded as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates but signaled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 percent to 42,342.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,867.08, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.1 percent to 19,372.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's move in stocks is "kind of a lacklustre recovery effort," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of good news has been priced into this market," he said. "And now the market is going to sit back and see if a lot of that good news that's priced in actually comes to fruition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were monitoring Capitol Hill where an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump on a spending bill raised the possibility of a government shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Micron Technology sank 16.2 percent after projecting earnings that lagged estimates. While the chip company benefited from strong demand for artificial intelligence, analysts pointed to a drag from weak demand for personal computers and automobile clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden and other chains, jumped 14.7 percent after projecting a 1.5 percent rise in same-restaurant sales for its full fiscal year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble as Fed eyes fewer 2025 rate cuts

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates but also slashed the number of 2025 rate cuts in its forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly lower after the Fed projected just two interest rate cuts next year, down from four.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow slid 2.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, to 42,326.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 3.0 percent to 5,872, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.6 percent to 19,392.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seeing the kind of decline we are experiencing right now indicates that the Fed took the market quite by surprise," said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although stocks often enjoy a late-year bounce referred to as the "Santa Claus rally," Stovall said the depth of Wednesday's drop could spur more selling if traders take profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe Santa is already on vacation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank, as expected, moved ahead with a decision to reduce interest rates by a quarter point as Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered an upbeat appraisal of the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the announcement was coupled with the altered outlook on 2025 monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the latest interest rate cut, the Fed is now "significantly closer" to the point where no further cuts will be needed, said Powell, who emphasised the central bank still views two percent inflation as a critical long-term priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's reaction suggests the investors are "grappling" with the likelihood that interest rates "for all intents and purposes, are going to remain higher for longer," said Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's losses were broad-based with 29 of 30 companies in the Dow ending lower and all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finishing in the red. (AFP)

<img alt="This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784091_1_20241219051243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, amid uncertainty about inflation and President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers voted 11-to-1 to lower the US central bank's key lending rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In updated economic forecasts, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee pencilled in just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of four, and hiked their inflation outlook for next year, from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed has made progress in tackling inflation through interest rate hikes in the last two years, and recently began paring back rates to boost demand in the economy and support the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent, and raising concerns that the US central bank's battle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump, whose economic proposals include tariff hikes and the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  These plans, combined with the recent uptick in inflation data, led some analysts to pare back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 ahead of Wednesday's meeting, predicting that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer. (AFP)

<img alt="Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are in preliminary merger talks as a way to deal with the growing competition to their business from EVs. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784003_1_20241218151346.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Honda and Nissan are in talks to deepen ties, media reports said on Wednesday, including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of how Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  A combined Honda and Nissan would create a US$54 billion company with annual output of 7.4 million vehicles, making it the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two firms had already forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan's deepening financial and strategic trouble in recent months has added more urgency for closer cooperation with larger rival Honda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan announced a US$2.6 billion cost savings plan last month that includes cutting 9,000 jobs and 20 percent of its global production capacity, as slumping sales in China and the US led to a 85 percent plunge in second-quarter profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but Honda itself is not resting on its laurels," said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at Itochu Research Institute. "Honda's cash flow is set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven't been going so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nissan closed nearly 24 percent higher in Tokyo trade on Wednesday, while shares of Honda, whose market value of US$43 billion is more than four times bigger than that of Nissan, declined three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Mitsubishi gained nearly 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automakers have been grappling with challenges from EV makers, particularly in China, where BYD and others have surged ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Honda and Nissan, first reported by the Nikkei newspaper, would allow the companies to cooperate more on technology and help them create a more formidable domestic rival to Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discussions are focused on finding ways to bolster collaboration and include the possibility of setting up a holding company, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies are also discussing the possibility of full merger, according to one of the people, as well as looking at ways to cooperate with Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi said no deal had been announced by any of the companies, though Nissan and Mitsubishi noted the three automakers had said previously they were considering opportunities for future collaboration.
  <br>
  <br>
  French automaker Renault, a major Nissan shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three Japanese automakers are expected to hold a joint news conference in Tokyo on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Reuters)

    US stocks retreat despite good retail sales data

<img alt="Solid US retail sales data were not enough to boost sentiment on Wall Street. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783925_1_20241218061003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks retreated on Tuesday despite solid US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq pulled back from its record in the prior session and was joined lower by the S&P 500 and the Dow, which fell for its ninth straight session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just sort of a pause here," said Art Hogan from B Riley Wealth Management, who noted equities had rallied after the US presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.6 percent at 43,449.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.4 percent to 6,050, while the Nasdaq shed 0.3 percent to 20,109.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates again on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the US central bank's monetary policy outlook projects additional cuts in 2025 in line with expectations, Hogan said stocks could rally Wednesday; but a disappointing forecast could send stocks lower, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales rose 0.7 percent in November from a month earlier, up from a revised 0.5 percent in October and above analysts' forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts attributed the positive numbers in part to the speedy resolution of the US presidential contest.

  Online e-commerce platform eBay won 0.9 percent after announcing the board authorised an additional 43 billion for share repurchases. (AFP)

    Walmart, Meituan team up to boost e-commerce sales

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart said on Tuesday it had formed a strategic partnership with Meituan, under which the Chinese firm has begun providing delivery services for Walmart goods and the US company will be featured on its popular app.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move will help Walmart accelerate its e-commerce business in China, which accounts for nearly half of its sales in the country, Walmart's China unit said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership follows Walmart's sale of a stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com for US$3.7 billion in August, allowing it to diversify beyond JD's logistics services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meituan is China's biggest food delivery company but also provides a host of other services that range from deliveries of other goods to bike-sharing and ticket booking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the company most Chinese consumers turn to when they want a quick delivery of basic household items and Walmart will become more visible by being on the Meituan app, said Jason Yu, general manager at CTR Market Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart last month reported that quarterly net sales in China, including sales from both Walmart and its members-only Sam's Club stores, surged 17 percent to US$4.9 billion. (Reuters)

 The tech-rich Nasdaq surged to a fresh record Monday at the start of a heavy week of economic news that includes a US Federal Reserve rate decision.

  <br>
  Large gains by chip company Broadcom, Google parent Alphabet and some other tech names helped lift the index 1.2 percent to 20,173.

  "There's renewed optimism in semiconductor and big tech stocks," Sarhan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said the market may take a breather until it receives key data points later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot to digest this week," Ablin said of a calendar that includes key retail sales and inflation data, as well as a Fed monetary policy decision. (AFP)

    Trump, SoftBank CEO announce US$100 billion investment

<img alt="Donald Trump (right) and Masayoshi Son (left) say a planned investment by Softbank will create about 100,000 US jobs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783752_1_20241217022004.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump, with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at his side, announced on Monday that SoftBank would invest US$100 billion in the United States over the next four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said in his joint appearance with Son that the investment would create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and related infrastructure, with the money to be deployed before the end of Trump's term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the investment was evidence of "monumental confidence in America's future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$100 billion pledge, made at a flag-bedecked event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, fits in with Trump's vow to bolster the US economy and reduce the effect of inflation on Americans during his second term, which begins on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called Son "one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Monday announcement echoes a similar pledge Son made with then-President-elect Trump in December 2016 at Trump Tower, when Son said he would spend US$50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  While that money was eventually spent, it is unclear whether those jobs were created. The company has been rebuilding its finances after the failure of high-flying office-sharing start-up WeWork and after investors soured on some of the tech firms that it's invested in through its Vision Fund unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's unclear how SoftBank plans to fund the new investment. As of September 30, SoftBank had about US$29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent earnings report. After a sharp decline in shares between 2021 and 2023, its stock has recovered, gaining nearly 50 percent year-to-date. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.

  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 US equity markets dipped fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq retreating below 20,000 following a US inflation report that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US wholesale inflation came in at 0.4 percent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 percent in October and higher than projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the inflation report, markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we're seeing profit-taking after a big day," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research, who viewed the inflation report as unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dropped 0.7 percent to 19,902.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 percent to 43,914.12, while the S&P 500 also shed 0.5 percent to 6,051.25.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock indices have scored repeat records since Donald Trump won the November 5 presidential election. The Republican took a victory lap on Thursday morning, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Adobe tumbled 13.7 percent on disappointment over the software giant's forecast for next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Warner Bros. Discovery surged 15.4 percent as it announced a reorganization, with one major division focused on operating television networks and the other focused on streaming and movie studios. (AFP)

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a mixed session on Wednesday, with a rally in Google's parent company Alphabet spurring the tech-rich Nasdaq to end the day above 20,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slipped 0.2 percent to close at 44,148, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 6,084.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq was the day's big winner, jumping 1.8 percent to close at a new record of 20,034, after Alphabet reported it had made a breakthrough in quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent the firm's share price soaring, with its class A shares closing up 5.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also digesting the news that consumer inflation ticked higher last month, largely in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investors are reacting positively to the latest inflation data for two reasons," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Number one, it gives the Fed more room to continue with easy money, cutting rates," he said. "And then number two, it allows more room for the economy to grow without the threat of inflation picking up." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday as markets paused from a post-election rally, while Google parent Alphabet surged on what it called a "major" technology announcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  After winning numerous records in the weeks since the November 5 presidential election, US stocks have fallen the last two days amid caution ahead of key inflation data.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Alphabet jumped 5.3 percent after Google showed off a new quantum computing chip that it described as a significant breakthrough in the field that it said could lead to advances in drug discovery, fusion energy and other areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.4 percent at 44.247.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent to 6,034, while the tech-rich Nasdaq also fell 0.3 percent to 19,687.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses come ahead of Thursday's consumer price index, which will be closely scrutinised by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance soared 17.7 percent following reports that it could be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing jumped 4.5 percent as it announced it was resuming production at two Seattle-area plants that had been shuttered for nearly three months due to a labour strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle slumped 6.7 percent after reporting lower-than-expected profits despite "extraordinary" growth in the artificial intelligence segment of the company's infrastructure business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group surged 13.2 percent as it unveiled a medium-term outlook that promised "at least" US$10 earnings per share in 2027. In 2023, the airline company earned US1.83 per share. (AFP)

 Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down 0.5 percent at 20,311.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.6 percent at 3,422, while the Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.8 percent higher at 10,812.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Yeung, the chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy on Monday has sent a positive signal to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the market has been excited in the last 24 hours after the Politburo statement. But obviously, it's just a change of wording that creates a lot of imagination," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It basically implies that the central bank is willing to cut the interest rate more and to inject liquidity... From now towards the National People's Congress [meeting], the market will be expecting more consumption support in almost every holiday season."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said careful timing and execution are important given the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The main US indices finished lower on Monday, fueled by a decline in AI leader Nvidia that weighed on tech stocks, as investors looked ahead to a crucial inflation report set for later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell after China's market regulator launched an investigation into the chipmaker over suspected violation of antimonopoly law, dragging down the information technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Advanced Micro Devices slipped after BofA Global Research downgraded its rating on the stock, weighing on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market was taken a bit by surprise regarding China's investigating (Nvidia) as a possible antimonopoly-law violation. So that's one thing that's putting a little damper on the market," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 37.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 6,052.35, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 123.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,736.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to 44,401.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast declined after forecasting a loss of more than 100,000 broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, denting the communication services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Hershey soared following a report that Cadbury parent Mondelez was exploring an acquisition of the chocolate maker. Mondelez shares fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are anticipating the consumer price index (CPI) data set for release on Wednesday, along with the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, emphasized caution regarding the central bank's approach to easing monetary policy due to the economy's resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes started December on a positive note, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both gaining in their first week, while the blue-chip Dow ended the week slightly lower.
  <br>

  US stocks soared in November after Donald Trump won the presidential election and his party secured control of both houses of Congress, raising expectations for a more business-friendly policy agenda. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Air India has placed an order to buy 100 more Airbus aircraft, the Tata Group-owned carrier said on Monday, in a deal aimed at bolstering its fleet and winning over flyers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline said the deal consisted of 10 widebody A350 and 90 narrowbody A320 family aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new purchase, the company said in a statement, is "in addition" to the orders for 470 aircraft Air India placed with Airbus and Boeing last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the two deals were announced, it was the largest order unveiled at the same time by a commercial carrier, with list price calculations for the jets suggesting an estimated value north of US$70 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest order takes the total number of aircraft that Air India ordered with Airbus in 2023 from 250 aircraft, comprising 40 A350 and 210 A320 family aircraft, to 350," the carrier said in a statement, without giving price details on the latest order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking over the former national carrier in 2022, the sprawling Tata Group conglomerate has sought to turn around the loss-making airline by ordering new aircraft and upgrading its existing fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said the airline saw a "clear case" for Air India to expand its future fleet beyond the 470 aircraft ordered in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These additional 100 Airbus aircraft will help to position Air India on the path to greater growth and contribute to our mission of building Air India into a world-class airline that connects India to every corner of the world," Chandrasekaran said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement that he was pleased by Air India's latest investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having personally witnessed the formidable growth of the Indian aviation sector... I am glad to see Air India renew its trust in Airbus with this additional order," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.

 The Nasdaq and the S&P hit fresh records on Friday after the November US jobs report came in better than expected, with the Dow edging down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, up from a revised 36,000 in October, according to the Department of Labor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of being viewed as a Goldilocks jobs print," Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management told AFP.

  <br>
  "The jobs market is cooling, there's no question about that, but it's still relatively healthy," he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin topped the US$100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president rolls on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes just hours after the president-elect signalled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry with his choice of Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to nominate Atkins, a former SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from US$69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as US$101,512 Wednesday, just two years after dropping below US$17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long bitcoin will stay above the coveted US$100,000 mark is uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday, extending a post-election rally on optimism about more interest rate cuts and an artificial intelligence boom after strong Salesforce results.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices scored records, led by the Dow Jones, which finished above 45,000 for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market at this point is looking for excuses to go up, and there's not really anything that might work against that narrative," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last couple of days, it's managed to ignore all sorts of inconvenient things," Sosnick said of the market's shrugging response to political upheaval in France and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 45,014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, its fourth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.3 percent to 19,735, its third straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's gains came after payroll firm ADP said US private-sector hiring in November came in at a lower-than-expected 146,000 jobs, while a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed weaker sentiment than expected in the services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the lacklustre data boosts expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a New York conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained from tipping his hand, but he "didn't say anything that would scare the market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare noted that Wednesday's gains were led by large tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft, which are major AI players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boost followed strong results from Salesforce, which was the biggest gainer in the Dow with an 11 percent jump. (AFP)

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)
