<img alt="Wall Street ended the week on a positive note, continuing earlier gains on optimism about the Trump Administration. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780490_1_20241123065830.jpg&q=80">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to a fresh record on Friday, extending a post-election US equity rally while the euro retreated against the US dollar following weak eurozone data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blue-chip index piled on one percent to end the day at 44,296.51, narrowly overtaking a record set earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose one percent to close at 44,296.51, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,969.34 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to 19,003.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major American indices have been at or near record territory since the US election, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump's programme of tax cuts and regulatory scale-back would more than offset the impact of expected tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trading most of this week has been influenced by the growth agenda," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have been cheered this week by a broadening of the rally beyond the tech names that dominated earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar also continued to strengthen, reflecting less certainty about additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the US currency's status as a haven asset amid escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro was also battered by a closely watched survey showing contractions in November business activity in the eurozone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) published by S&P Global dropped to 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October, the most marked rate of contraction in 10 months. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things could hardly have turned out much worse," said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone's manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the euro fell both Paris and Frankfurt stocks managed to recover their losses and advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone data has increased the chance of more rate cuts from the ECB next year," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as well a cut of 50 basis points next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have been jolted into recalibrating interest rate expectations on the back of this bleak economic news," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  London managed to gain 1.4 percent despite data showing that retail sales figures for October undershot forecasts, as the pound fell against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin set a new record high above US$99,500 on Friday, before easing slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leading digital currency is expected to push through US$100,000 as investors grow increasingly hopeful that Trump will pass measures to deregulate the crypto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared more than 40 percent since the Republican's election victory this month and has more than doubled since the turn of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent surge has also been "driven by news that Trump could set up an official crypto department that would sit in the heart of US government," said XTB's Brooks. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street's main indices ended the session higher. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780313_1_20241122053523.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The major US  indexes closed higher after choppy trading on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 hitting one-week high.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dow Jones Industrial Average gains were aided by cloud company Salesforce's advances after three brokerages lifted their price targets on the stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Wall Street's biggest company, Nvidia, were up after initially choppy trading following its earnings release on Wednesday. The chip company surpassed expectations for quarterly results, and projected fourth-quarter revenue above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Nvidia's] earnings report was really, really good. Some of the whisper numbers were higher and they disappointed there, but the fundamentals of AI and Nvidia continue to fire on all cylinders and the outlook for next year is positive," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 percent to 43,870.35, the S&P 500 gained 0.53 percent to 5,948.49 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up fractionally to end barely changed at 18,972.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alphabet slid to touch a four-week low after the Justice Department argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its monopoly on online search.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock's losses weighed on the communication services sector, which was a drag on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com fell after a report said it will likely face an EU investigation next year into whether it favours its own brand products on its online marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the data front, a weekly report on jobless claims showed they fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from Federal Reserve officials before the mid-December FOMC meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Money-market bets point to a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ve moved on from the election a bit, we got the Nvidia report, so the next thing markets will look for is the Fed meeting, and some policy speak from Fed officials this week have pointed to maybe a pause in the making for December," Saglimbene said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said the United States is more vulnerable to inflationary shocks than in the past, according to a media report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he supports further interest rate cuts and is open to doing them more slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders also monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia that sent crude prices higher and aided a gain in the energy sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of machinery manufacturer Deere gained after reporting an upbeat fourth-quarter profit, while AI company Snowflake jumped after raising its annual product revenue forecast. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high on Thursday as it benefits from expectations that Donald Trump will push through measures to ease regulation of cryptocurrencies. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780197_1_20241121111040.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin's march toward US$100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier US regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin prices topped US$95,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above US$95,040.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40 percent in the two weeks since Trump was voted in and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the US$100k level," said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$4 billion has streamed into US listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crypto-related stocks have been soaring along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 14 percent overnight, while MicroStrategy, a loss-making software company that has been buying bitcoin, rose 10 percent to take its market capitalisation beyond US$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many are wondering if this administration will bring the regulatory clarity the crypto community has been waiting for. It's likely too soon to say," said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund issuer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see all of this excitement as bullish not only for bitcoin or crypto broadly, but the entire blockchain-enabled ecosystem that is growing today." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed at the end of a choppy session on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia earnings and sold off Target after weak results.
 <br>
  <br>
  One day after Walmart impressed investors with a bullish report ahead of the holiday shopping season, Target lost more than one-fifth of its market value as the retailer projected flat comparable sales in the coming quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Target "encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures," acknowledged CEO Brian Cornell, adding that he remained "confident in the underlying strength and fundamentals of our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 43,408.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,917, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 18,966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have been monitoring the brittle state of the Russia-Ukraine conflict after Moscow loosened its rules on using nuclear arms following Ukraine firing long-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  US investors have also been fixated on earnings from artificial intelligence star Nvidia due late on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 0.8 percent during the session and another 2.9 percent after the company reported US$19 billion in profits, easily topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Comcast rose 1.6 percent after announcing plans to pool together cable network channels including CNBC and MSNBC in a spin-off, further denting the conventional cable news business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford fell 2.9 percent as it announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe, mostly in Germany and Britain. Executives also signalled they expect the incoming Trump administration to shift course on energy and climate policy, likely slowing the ramp-up of electric vehicle production. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street finished mixed ahead of Nvidia results on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779983_1_20241120052411.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks shrugged off early weakness amid the worsening Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday and finished mostly higher ahead of Nvidia results.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent much of the early going on the back foot, as Russia threatened major retaliation after Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, a nuclear threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin unsettled investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices later pushed into positive territory, with the Nasdaq finishing at 18,987, up 1.0 percent
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 5,916, while the Dow Jones declined 0.3 percent to 43,268.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of on our own continent over here," Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners said of the US investor mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In time, we would be impacted by an escalation of tensions. But today we're going to shrug that off, because tomorrow we get Nvidia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence star Nvidia piled on nearly five percent ahead of results on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other tech giants also advanced, Netflix and Tesla winning at least 1.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart rose three percent as it lifted its full-year forecast on higher profits. Walmart's US business, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenues, enjoyed a solid 5.3 percent gain in comparable store sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lowe's dropped 4.6 percent as it lifted some of its full-year projections. However, the home-improvement retailer still expects full-year comparable sales to be down at least three percent in 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spirit Airlines said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection, after the pioneer of no-frills travel in the US struggled with a long run of quarterly losses, failed merger attempts and looming debt maturities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, had been losing money despite strong travel demand as it struggled with higher operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's troubles deepened after the collapse of its US$3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that grounded many of its aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline listed its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of US$1 billion to US$10 billion each, according to a court filing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline, as part of the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has received commitment for a US$350 million equity investment from existing bondholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Existing bondholders will also provide US$300 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which, together with available cash, is expected to support the airline through the Chapter 11 process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it expected to continue its flight operations through the proceedings and customers can book and fly without interruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the near term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it expected to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's shares, halted for trading on Monday, have plunged more than 90 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company started out as a long-haul trucking company in 1964 before shifting to aviation around 1983. It offered leisure packages to popular destinations under the name Charter One Airlines and rebranded to Spirit in 1992. (Reuters/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed mixed on Monday, with traders bracing for Nvidia earnings later this week, and piling into Tesla on reports that President-elect Donald Trump could ease regulation on self-driving vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent to 43,389.60, while the S&P 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,893.62.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 18,791.81, buoyed by a jump in the share price of electric vehicle maker Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's share price jumped 5.6 percent following a Bloomberg News report over the weekend that Trump is looking to ease the restrictions on self-driving cars, which could benefit Tesla -- which is run by Trump-backer Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But elsewhere, it was "a relatively unremarkable day, in terms of magnitude of move," said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management, adding that this wasn't surprising, citing the post-election market "explosion," and the subsequent drawback last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kind of entered the new week at a midpoint with very little economic data," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are also looking ahead to earnings from chip designing titan Nvidia after markets close on Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="US markets finished lower as traders pondered comments from the head of the US central bank signalling that it was in no hurry to cut interest rates. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779429_1_20241116075502.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global stock markets ended the week on a sour note on Friday as traders digested Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments that the US central bank was not on a preset path to cut interest rates.
 <br>
  <br>
  After Powell indicated the Fed was in no hurry to cut rates as it monitors inflation's downward trajectory, Wall Street turned red, with all three major indices closing lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly Powell's speech has triggered some skepticism about the path of rates, with potentially December being a skip instead of another cut," Edward Jones senior investment strategist Angelo Kourkafas told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But we do have another inflation and jobs report before that, so there is still a good sense we might see another rate cut in December," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 percent to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.2 percent to 18,680.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading the way down were a clutch of vaccine-makers' stocks after US President-elect Donald Trump indicated he would appoint vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, London was off 0.1 percent, digesting disappointing growth data. Frankfurt and Paris also ended in the red.

  <br>
  Disappointing US retail sales in October did not help overall sentiment as oil prices also drifted down.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a speech on Thursday, Powell said that "the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."
  <br>
  <br>
  While the US central bank is expected to cut interest rates again next month, investors are scaling back their bets on how many cuts will be made next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are worried tax cuts and tariffs planned by Trump could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The (Trump) administration's renewed focus on tariffs could weigh heavily on currencies of trade-exposed economies, particularly those in Asia and the eurozone," said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  European markets stuttered as the European Commission predicted economic growth would pick up slightly and inflation would keep falling in the eurozone next year, but warned of growing risks linked to geopolitical tensions. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government announced on Friday that it has revised its full-year economic growth forecast to 2.5 percent, compared with the previous estimated range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Real GDP in the third quarter grew by 1.8 percent year-on-year, slower than the 3.2 percent growth in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government economist Adolph Leung said at a press conference that economic growth has been hindered by challenges in the external environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Increased global economic uncertainties and escalation of trade conflicts would affect the performance of our goods exports," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leung expressed confidence that the economy will pick up steam, thanks to measures announced by the central and SAR governments to boost market sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the outlook, while the external environment has turned more challenging recently, the Hong Kong economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum for the remainder of the year," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about US President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slap up to 60 percent of tariffs on goods imported from China, Leung said that will have a "detrimental impact".
  <br>
  <br>
  "It will affect China's exports to the US and also Hong Kong's exports of mainland origin to the US. And I think more than that is that coming along with this kind of trade and economic policy in the US, it will also affect the interest rates outlook."

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government will issue retail infrastructure bond worth HK$20 billion next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The three-year bond will be linked to inflation and offer a minimum guaranteed interest of 3.5 percent, to be paid every six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's lower than the 4 percent for the latest round of silver bond offered by the government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, executive director for external affairs for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Kenneth Hui, said the interest for the retail infrastructure bond is still appealing to investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we set the interest rate, we do consider a combination of factors, including market conditions as well as the demand, as well as the interest rates of comparable products right now in the market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "All things considered, we feel that 3.5 percent is an attractive rate, particularly considering the latest interest rate trend in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said each lot is worth HK$10,000, and each investor will be allocated a maximum of 100 lots.
  <br>
  <br>
  The subscription period will last from November 26 to December 6.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bond will be issued on December 17 and listed on the local bourse the next day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proceeds will be used to finance infrastructure projects, including new towns and airport development.

File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779227_1_20241115061843.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The recent performance of the US economy has been "the best of any major economy in the world," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday, a week after the bank cut interest rates for a second consecutive meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank recently started cutting back its key lending rates from a two-decade high, turning attention from tackling inflation to supporting the labor market as the rate of price increases has moderated.
  <br>
  <br>
  There has been widespread anger about the cumulative impact of years of inflation, which has pushed up consumer prices by more than 20 percent since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the economic facts today are clear, Powell said during an event in Dallas, Texas, noting that inflation was falling toward the Fed's long-term two percent target, the labor market was "solid," and economic growth remained resilient.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell noted that inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was "running much closer" to the bank's target, but had not reached it just yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are moving policy over time to a more neutral setting," he said, referring to the level of interest rates over the long run that keep both inflation and unemployment in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the path for getting there is not preset," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures traders currently place a probability of close to 60 percent that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. (AFP)

    Wall Street down as Fed comments dampen rate cut hopes

<img alt="US markets ended lower after comments from the US central bank appeared to dowse hopes of an imminent rate cut. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779222_1_20241115053414.jpg&q=35">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dampened investor hopes for another interest rate cut this year by saying the US central bank need not rush to ease monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Powell said at a Dallas Fed event that with the economy still growing, the job market solid and inflation still above the 2 percent target, the Fed can deliberate carefully on rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  While traders were still betting on a 25-basis point reduction at the Fed's December meeting, the probability sank to 55.5 percent from 76 percent earlier in the afternoon and from 82.5 percent on Wednesday, the CME Fed Watch tool showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The comments from Powell put more cold water on what used to be a very optimistic outlook on the path for rate cuts," said Adam Hetts, global head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, we can't take for granted that inflation and labor are in balance so this is an encouraging message on the economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell almost 0.47 percent, to 43,752. The S&P lost 0.61 percent, to end at 5,949, while the Nasdaq lost 0.64 percent, to 19,107.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier on Thursday data showed the producer price index for final demand rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in October, in line with forecasts, though the annual rise of 2.4 percent was a touch higher than expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jobless claims dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, lower than forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's more and more evidence that inflation remains higher than the Fed's 2 percent target," said Melissa Brown, managing director for Investment Decision Research at SimCorp in New York. "The numbers were roughly in line with expectations but sometimes investors step back and say, 'What does this really mean?' It leads to more uncertainty about what the Fed does after the December meeting." (Reuters)

    China's Zeekr to take control of sister brand Lynk

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Geely said on Thursday its premium electric vehicle maker Zeekr plans to take control of sister brand Lynk & Co - the first big restructuring move in a planned overhaul for the sprawling automotive group.
 <br>
  <br>
  Geely Holding, which owns the two marques as well as 10 other automotive brands, has pivoted away from its history of aggressive acquisitions to streamlining its operations and cutting costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Group Chairman Eric Li told staff in September that deep integration was needed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. All brands in the group should clarify how their models are positioned to avoid overlap, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Geely said it wants Zeekr and Lynk to form a new energy vehicle manufacturing group with combined annual sales of more than a million units. That compares with about 339,000 vehicles for the two brands in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't integrate (Zeekr and Lynk), we must face issues such as internal competition ... and redundant investments in many aspects such as R&D, sales, which is stupid," Gui Shengyue, chief executive of Geely Automobile Holdings told a conference call with analysts after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we don't do it, the overall competitiveness of Geely definitely would not be improved."
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal provides for Zeekr to purchase a stake of 30 percent from another group firm, Volvo Cars, and a stake of 20 percent from Geely Holding, the group said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Volvo Cars were up 3.5 percent in early trade, among the biggest gainers on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.
  <br>
  <br>
  US-listed shares of Zeekr dropped over 7 percent in premarket trading on Thursday after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zeekr will then nudge its stake up to 51 percent with a capital injection while Geely Auto, the group's main listed arm, will continue to own the rest.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal values Lynk, a Chinese-Swedish brand, at about 18 billion yuan. It should be completed by June next year, a person with direct knowledge of the plans said. (Reuters)

 Legislators on Thursday said Hong Kong’s stock market operated as usual during the first session under a T8.
 <br>
  <br>
  The decades-long practice of shutting down the markets when there's severe weather was scrapped in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial services sector lawmaker Robert Lee said no major incidents were seen during the morning trading session, but there was room for improvement regarding the use of physical cheques.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the brokers' perspective a lot of them already have electronic payment methods with the exchange. However, for a lot of the ultimate end clients, they may not all have these electronic payment methods,” he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think in terms of physical cheques, that's something that the HKMA recognises as a form of payment. For some of these people that are having some difficulties with dealing with physical cheques, I think there's room for improvement.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Accountancy sector lawmaker Edmund Wong said the stock exchange and the finance sector were well-prepared for business under severe weather conditions, allowing the stock market to run smoothly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market opened at 9.30am. The observatory downgraded the T8 to a T3 at 10.20am.

 Trading in Hong Kong financial markets opened as usual on Thursday morning despite the T8 typhoon signal - the first time since authorities scrapped trading suspension under severe weather in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Stock Exchanges and Clearing said securities and derivatives markets will remain fully operational.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index opened down 197 points, or 0.99 percent, at 19,626 on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the mainland, stocks also opened lower, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index down 0.28 percent at 3,429. The Shenzhen Component Index opened 0.23 percent lower at 11,333 points. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks were little-changed on Wednesday, as traders digested fresh data pointing to a small and widely expected rise in inflation last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones inched up 0.1 percent to 43,958, while the S&P 500 rose by less than 0.1 percent to 5,985.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.3 percent to 19,230.
  <br>
  <br>
  There had been some concern ahead of Wednesday's CPI report that it could be hotter than expected, said B Riley Wealth Management chief market strategist Art Hogan.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the end, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 2.6 percent in the 12 months to October, in line with economists' expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The drivers in large part are the fact that the CPI came in very much in line with expectations, and some buzz in the markets yesterday," he said. "So that coming in line was very much a positive."
  <br>

  Among individual stocks, the chip designer AMD fell more than 3.0 percent as the company announced it was laying off around four percent of its employees. (AFP)

<img alt="Bitcoin soared to fresh heights in topping US$90,000, after Donald Trump pledged to ease regulation around digital tokens. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778974_1_20241114012954.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin broke through the US$90,000 level on Wednesday, as its rally showed no signs of easing on expectations that Donald Trump as US president will be a boon for cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has become one of the most eye-catching movers in the week since the election and on Wednesday touched record highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s value has rocketed up 32 percent since the November 5 election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Smaller peer ether has risen 37 percent since election day, while dogecoin, an alternative, volatile token promoted by billionaire Trump-ally Elon Musk was up more than 150 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear how or when that could happen but the possibility drove a speculative surge in crypto mining and trading stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Key areas to monitor include potential regulatory changes, increased institutional participation, and a rise in M&A activity," said Carl Szantyr, managing partner of digital asset hedge fund Blockstone Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new political landscape may bring clearer regulations for crypto assets and could prompt strategic developments, such as a national bitcoin reserve and growth in the mining sector." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks finished the day in the red on Tuesday, as traders looked to consolidate some of their gains since Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We got a significant run," said Art Hogan from B Riley Wealth Management. "After a run like that in such a short period of time, it's not surprising for markets to take a breather."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones fell 0.9 percent to 43,910, while the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 5,983.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq rounded out the fall among major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.1 percent at 19,281.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Tesla fell 6.1 percent as traders looked to make the most of a recent surge in the electric vehicle-maker's share price after Trump's victory, which was strongly supported by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biotech firm Amgen also shed value on Tuesday after an analyst published a research note raising questions about an experimental anti-obesity drug.
  <br>
  <br>
  As well as digesting last week's election result, and what it means for the markets, traders are also looking ahead to a number of data releases this week, including fresh consumer inflation data to be published on Wednesday. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday expressed confidence that Hong Kong's exchange traded-fund (ETF) market will continue to grow and reinforce the SAR's status as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a ceremony marking the 25th anniversary of the Tracker Fund, Chan said the city has established itself as a leading ETF hub, offering a wide range of products and attracting many issuers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Created during the Asian financial crisis, the Tracker Fund has grown five-fold from an initial size of over HK$33 billion to become Hong Kong's largest ETF with a market cap of over HK$150 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the past 25 years, along with Hong Kong and our capital market, the Tracker Fund has demonstrated incredible resilience in navigating multiple challenges," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has earned the trust of local, mainland and international investors seeking exposure to Hang Seng Index's constituent stock. It offers investors a simple way to invest in a diversified portfolio of Hong Kong stocks, mitigating the risks of excessive concentration in a very cost-effective manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief added that the fund's global footprint is expanding, including listings on the Thai stock exchange and a new ETF on the Saudi stock exchange.

<img alt="A model of the proposed COMAC C929, a wide-bodied commercial jet to be made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778667_1_20241112121628.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The  Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) on Tuesday said that national carrier Air China would be the launch customer for the company's C929 wide-body aircraft under development that is designed to compete with twin-aisle models from Airbus and Boeing.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC's deputy director of marketing, Liu Yan, made the announcement at China's biggest air show in Zhuhai.
  <br>
  <br>
  He did not disclose the number of aircraft Air China would purchase or planned delivery dates.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has said the C929 would have 280 to 400 seats and a range of 12,000 kilometres, which is in the same category as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The C929 was renamed in 2023 from the CR929 after Russia left a China-Russia joint venture developing the aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report in April from the C929's fuselage manufacturer said it aimed to deliver the first fuselage section by September 2027.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC deputy general manager Tong Yu in May told a group of Hong Kong reporters in Shanghai that a C929 prototype would be seen in the near future and estimated the jet could "soon" take a test flight. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sizeable delegations from many Asian countries and territories will be converging this week on the Peruvian city of Lima for this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit – including ones led by President Xi Jinping and Chief Executive John Lee.
 <br>
  <br>
  The influx of Asian visitors will be a bit of an anomaly for the South American country – since tourists from Asia normally make up just 3.4 percent of all international arrivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s a figure that Peru – for which tourism is the third-biggest industry – wants to pump up.
  <br>
  <br>
  RTHK spoke to some Chinese migrants to the country who believe there’s growing interest among Asian travellers in making the long and expensive trip to the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alicia Tay moved to Peru in 1983 and now runs a travel agency in Lima specialising in MICE tourism – catering to business travellers attending  meetings, conferences and exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  She noted a growing number of Chinese firms wishing to bring their employees to Peru and other parts of South America in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of our customers have travelled extensively around the world, such as Europe and of course Asia. Even the United States and Canada, many have been to these places. But for South America, it is certainly a new destination for them,” Tay explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, she said many Peruvian holidaymakers are curious about Asia, and see mainland China and Hong Kong as places with cutting-edge technology. There are also businessmen who are looking for investment opportunities abroad.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I think the Peruvians consider China as a potential country [to invest in] industries and technologies. I think it’s a point of interest, they want to visit China,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Peruvian government has been going all out in recent years to lure tourists, telling them there’s much more to see than just the ancient Inca town of Machu Picchu.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is a lucrative business after all: holidaymakers who are willing to travel halfway across the world to Peru usually have deep pockets. That includes Hue, a visitor from Sydney, Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  “I'm here for a 19-day South American tour to see Machu Picchu, Iguazu Falls, mainly for sightseeing,” she said, adding she was planning to spend nearly US$10,000 for the trip.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Do I think it's worth it? Look, I think it is. I mean, for me, experience is more valuable than goods, so that's where I splurge my money.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen natives Rachel and her sister planned to spend even more.
  <br>
  <br>
  “It’s around US$30,000, because we have a plan to go to Antarctica, I think that costs a lot. It takes around 28 days,” she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peru hopes that the Apec meetings, which is held in Lima for the third time since 2008, will further raise the nation’s profile and attract more visitors and even investment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US main indexes closed at new records highs on Monday, lifted by stocks expected to benefit from Republican President-elect Donald Trump's potential fiscal policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tesla's stock market value surged 9 percent to over US$1.1 trillion, fuelled by bets the auto-maker will benefit from CEO Elon Musk's close ties to Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platforms each dipped about 1 percent.

  <br>
  All three major Wall Street indexes closed at records.

  <br>
  <br>
  Volume on US exchanges was heavy, with 15.4 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 12.8 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crypto stocks rallied as bitcoin soared to a record US$87,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are watching consumer price inflation data, due Wednesday, and a raft of other key data this week for signals on the economy and monetary policy outlook.(Reuters)

<img alt="Speculators are betting on a Donald Trump presidency giving cryptocurrencies a boost. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778438_1_20241110213830.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin soared to a new record high on Sunday, as traders bet that Donald Trump's return to the White House will be good for the cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency passed US$80,000 for the first time in its history shortly after 12:00 pm (1200 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  It has been rising since Republican candidate Trump won last Tuesday's US presidential election over sentiment that he will ease regulations on digital currencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin reached US$75,000 on Wednesday, topping its previous all-time peak of US$73,797 achieved in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump was seen as the pro-crypto candidate in his battle with the Democratic Party's candidate Kamala Harris.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first presidency, Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam but has since radically changed his position, even launching his own platform for the unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world," and to put tech billionaire and right-wing conspiracy theorist Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  The previous Trump term saw corporate tax cuts that brought more liquidity to markets, encouraging investment into high-growth assets such as cryptocurrency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced in September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch a digital currency platform named World Liberty Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it had a faltering sales launch earlier this month, with only a fraction of its tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the run-up to the election, Trump apparently became the first former president to use bitcoin in a purchase, as he bought burgers at a New York City restaurant, which hailed it as a "historic transaction."
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin is listed continuously, including on Sundays. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said market sentiment has improved due to declining interest rates and measures to stabilise the economy, despite slower economic growth in the third quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his weekly blog, Chan noted increased transactions in both the stock and property markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect that Hong Kong's economy will continue to maintain momentum for the rest of this year, with the full-year economic growth projected to be close to the lower end of the original forecast range," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 1.8 percent in the three months ending September on a year-on-year basis, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the first quarter and a 3.3 percent growth in the April-to-June period. Officials are forecasting full-year growth of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the government will sign agreements with 17 more strategic enterprises – from the mainland, the US and Europe – on Monday to establish or expand their businesses here.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies are involved in fields such as AI, big data and new energy, and 90 percent of them plan to set up headquarters in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Together with the first two batches of nearly 50 strategic enterprises, Chan said they will bring HK$42 billion in investment to Hong Kong and create more than 17,000 jobs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation rate slowed in October, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in October, down from 0.4 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This comes as authorities on Friday unveiled a sweeping plan to lift local government debt and boost spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  In September, Beijing began unveiling fresh measures aimed at boosting economic activity,  including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher, with investors upbeat about the business agenda of President-elect Donald Trump.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished at fresh records on Friday, ending a buoyant week on a positive note prompted by relief at the swift resolution of the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 finished at 5,995.54, up 0.4 percent for the day and 4.7 percent for the week as markets welcomed President-elect Donald Trump's growth agenda.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent to 43,988.99, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.1 percent to 19,286.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're in this honeymoon period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, which we saw in previous election cycles," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin thinks the strength in US equities could extend through the rest of 2024, but cautioned that worries about overvaluation will grow if the market keeps rising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have greeted Trump's win in anticipation that tax cuts and regulatory relief will more than offset the ills of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump appointees are also expected to permit more corporate dealmaking, boosting mergers and acquisitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday marked the debut in the Dow of chip company Nvidia, which declined 0.8 percent and paint company Sherwin-Williams, which rose 0.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbnb fell 8.7 percent after reporting earnings that narrowly missed analyst expectations. Briefing.com said "investments beyond the company's core markets are adding cost, casting a cloud on otherwise uplifting trends from the quarter." (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday announced it had cut its base rate by 25 basis points to five percent with immediate effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The base rate is the benchmark for repo transactions under the discount window.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA said it cut the rate in response to an overnight cut in the US federal funds rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and the Bank of China said they would cut their best lending rates by a quarter of percentage point to 5.375 percent from Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, the US Federal Reserve announced a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point after policy-makers voted unanimously to lower the rate to between 4.50 and 4.75 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the HKMA said the pace of Fed rate cuts was still uncertain, posing a risk to global financial market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The rate-cut cycle in the US is still at its initial stage. Interest rates might still remain at relatively high levels for some time. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," the authority said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the Hong Kong dollar peg mechanism, interest rates move in lockstep with the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mackie Lau, Standard Chartered's co-Head of Treasury Markets in Greater China, North Asia and Hong Kong, said Donald Trump's proposed economic policies might affect the Fed's moves to tamp down inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's plan includes tax cuts, tariffs and a mass deportation of illegal immigrants.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Once Trump really starts to take office and begins to roll out his policies, that's the time when the market will begin to be more concerned with what will happen to the economy," Lau told an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we will need at least three, six months before that will all come through. Of course, the worry is that rates might have to reverse course and go higher because of the worry about inflation, but that's more for the longer term."
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, director of real estate consultancy Knight Frank, meanwhile, said local housing prices may hit bottom by the end of this year, as the Fed continues its rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now with the rates gradually being lowered, we are expecting the market purchasing power to go up a little bit and to be unleashed gradually. I think the property prices would find bottom in the fourth quarter in 2024," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market sentiment for 2025 must be better than 2024 in order to support a rebound," Wong added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq powered to fresh records on Thursday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, extending a buoyant post-election rally.
 <br>
  <br>
  While the Dow finished essentially flat, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped to new all-time highs, with large tech companies like Facebook parent Meta and Apple surging.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.51 percent, to 19,269. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was largely unchanged at 43,729, but the S&P 500 gained 0.74 percent, to 5,973.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed shrugged off concerns about the impact of Donald Trump's election victory and moved ahead with a quarter point interest rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the near term, the election will have no effects on our policy decisions," Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, noting there was still uncertainty about what President-elect Trump's actual economic agenda would be.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices had earlier hit all-time highs on Wednesday as markets greeted Trump's election win in anticipation that tax cuts and the de-regulation would offset the impact of higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets were cheered by Powell's tone, which kept the door open to further interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Of course, there's going to be a debate about the pace of rate cuts, but policy makers and chair Powell mentioned that they continue to think that policy is restrictive," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  While tech shares advanced, banking shares pulled back after a torrid session on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped 1.4 percent, while JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3 percent. (AFP)

<img alt="The chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says he plans to serve out his full term. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778068_1_20241108051635.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday that he would not resign if asked to leave early by President-elect Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference after unveiling a quarter point interest rate cut, Powell -- whose term as Fed chair ends in 2026 -- added that firing any of the Fed's seven governors was also "not permitted under the law."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments underscore the delicate balancing act policymakers may have to play in the next Trump administration, given the US president-elect's recent criticism of the Fed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly accused Powell -- whom he first appointed to run the US central bank -- of working to favour the Democrats, and has suggested he would look to replace him once his term as Fed Chair ends.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president-elect has also said he would like "at least" a say over setting Fed interest rates, something not currently allowed under the bank's dual mandate from Congress to act independently to tackle both inflation and unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed governors are nominated by the president, and appointed by the Senate to serve a 14-year term.
  <br>
  <br>
  They can also be appointed to serve out the remainder of a 14-year term if a Fed governor retires, and must then be reconfirmed.
  <br>
  <br>
  If he wanted to, Powell could stay on as a governor after he steps down as Fed chair, and serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in early 2028. (AFP)

<img alt="The Ontario-based company tempered its fiscal 2025 revenue expectations due to weak spending on luxury goods in the US. Photo" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778040_1_20241107214404.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Canada Goose Holdings posted a surprise quarterly profit and topped Wall Street estimates for revenue on Thursday, as the luxury parka maker benefits from a demand recovery in China, as well as its tight cost controls.
 <br>
  <br>
  Its US-listed shares rose 5 percent in premarket trading, as its robust performance in China contrasts with comments from bigger luxury brands such as Gucci-owner Kering and LVMH .
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue rose 2.5 percent in Greater China in the second quarter, Canada Goose said, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in the region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada Goose, whose parkas can retail for more than US$1,000, has also diversified by entering the non-winter category to include rain and warm weather clothing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding one-off items, Canada Goose posted a profit of 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with estimates for a loss of 5 Canadian cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  Selling, general and administrative expenses fell about 8 percent to C$162.5 million due to a cost-saving program that involved job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our second-quarter performance reflected steady progress across our operating priorities, as we navigated an increasingly challenging macro environment that affected consumer sentiment," CEO Dani Reiss said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the Ontario-based company tempered its fiscal 2025 revenue expectations due to weak spending on luxury goods in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  It now expects fiscal 2025 revenue to range from a low-single-digit decline to a low-single-digit increase, compared to its previous forecast of low-single-digit growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue in North America declined 3 percent in the reported quarter, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in the previous quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada Goose said second-quarter revenue fell to C$267.8 million (US$193 million) from C$281.1 million, a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts on average had expected revenue of C$260.2 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. (Reuters)

    Bank of England cuts interest rates to 4.75 percent

<img alt="The UK central bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1778032_1_20241107203826.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday for only the second time since 2020 and said future reductions were likely to be gradual, as it saw higher inflation and economic growth after the new government's first budget.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Monetary Policy Committee voted 8-1 to cut interest rates to 4.75 percent from 5 percent, a stronger majority than expectations in a Reuters poll for a 7-2 vote in favour of a cut. Catherine Mann dissented, preferring to keep rates on hold.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sterling rose by almost half a cent against the US dollar immediately after the announcement. British government bond prices fell but quickly reversed that drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much," BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if the economy evolves as we expect it's likely that interest rates will continue to fall gradually from here," he added, broadly echoing his language after September's meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE predicted that finance minister Rachel Reeves' budget announced last week - which entails big increases in tax, spending and borrowing - would boost the size of Britain's economy by around 0.75 percent next year but barely improve annual growth rates in two or three years' time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Her plan was likely to add just under half a percentage point to the rate of inflation at its peak in just over two years' time, the BoE said, causing inflation to take a year longer to return sustainably to its 2 percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reeves said families would welcome the BoE's rate cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE's cautious language on the future interest rate cuts was similar to previous months, in keeping with investors' view that it is likely to cut interest rates more slowly than the European Central Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE did not refer to Donald Trump's US election victory, which has prompted a big reduction in bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates aggressively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is expected to reduce its benchmark policy rate by quarter of a percentage point later on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the BoE's rate cut, financial markets priced only around two interest rate cuts from the BoE in 2025 - compared with between two and three beforehand and down from around four before the budget.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE said inflation was likely to rise to around 2.5 percent by the end of this year from 1.7 percent in September and hit 2.7 percent by the end of next year, before falling gradually below its 2 percent target by the end of the three-year forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  Government decisions to raise the cap on bus fares, hike value-added tax on private school fees and increase employers' social security contributions were likely to boost inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  With the latter measure combining with a 6.7 percent hike in the national minimum wage, the BoE said employers faced rising costs - although it could not be certain of the overall effect on inflation as employers might respond by sacking staff or accepting lower profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two of Britain's biggest businesses, BT and Sainsbury's, said on Thursday that tax changes in the budget would fuel inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE downgraded its forecast for average economic growth this year to 1 percent from 1.25 percent, reflecting recent revisions to past growth, it raised its forecast for 2025 to 1.5 percent from 1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This reflects the stronger, and relatively front-loaded, paths for government consumption and investment more than offsetting the impact on growth of higher taxes," the BoE said.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the BoE's forecasts for growth and inflation include the impact of higher spending and taxes, they do not include the effect of a big rise in market borrowing costs since the budget as it set those assumptions beforehand and did not update them.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the now-higher market interest rates were factored in, the outlook for inflation and growth would likely be a bit lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoE repeated its message that monetary policy would need to stay "restrictive for sufficiently long" to return inflation sustainably to the 2 percent target. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's leading chipmaker SMIC announced on Thursday a sharp rise in profits over the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  SMIC said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Thursday that its third-quarter profit attributable to owners of the company stood at US$148.8 million, a jump of 58.3 percent compared to the equivalent period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said its revenue rose to nearly US$2.2 billion, a record high and the first time it had raked in over US$2 billion in a single quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The results marked a return to form for the chipmaker after chalking up a nearly 60 percent year-on-year decline in profit in the second quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said it expected revenue growth to be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, adding that it would "strengthen our confidence in development, maintain our strategic focus, stabilise our market share and consolidate our position in the industry". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An economist on Thursday said Donald Trump's return to the White House will add uncertainty to the local economy even as confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the fourth quarter.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to research conducted by the Productivity Council and Standard Chartered Bank, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index rose 3.2 points to 45.7 points for the October-to-December period from the previous three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, and those above 50 a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  A reading of 52.8 in the second quarter of 2023 was the highest in the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kelvin Lau, a senior economist from Standard Chartered Bank, said local businesses are expected to be cautious moving forward over concerns that Trump may raise tariffs on Chinese goods, which could have an impact on Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If Trump starts talking about much more milder tariff hikes to begin with, we think that it could actually be not as bad of a news for a lot of the SMEs who have been expecting the worst," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think overall, we are looking at more subdued SME index performance, more cautiousness, prolonged cautiousness, but nothing more substantially worse than where we are now."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau also said Hong Kong's economy is on track towards recovery, but the pace is slower than what the market expects.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports surged last month at their fastest pace in more than two years, easily topping forecasts and providing optimism about the economy as officials steel for a potential trade war with the United States after Donald Trump was re-elected president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Exports rose 12.7 percent in October from a year earlier to US$309.1 billion, according to customs data released on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure is the best since July 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports to the US rose 8.1 percent while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months," Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "Any potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialise until the second half of next year."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Trump's return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as US importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports, meanwhile, fell 2.3 percent, turning negative for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus rose to US$95.7 billion in October, up from US$81.7 billion in September. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to all-time records on Wednesday in a torrid post-election rally that cheered Donald Trump's growth agenda and welcomed the presidential race's swift conclusion.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished at all time-highs, led by the Dow Jones, which piled on 3.6 percent at 43,729.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 2.5 percent to 5,929, while the Nasdaq jumped 3.0 percent to 18,983.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets expect passage of Trump's agenda based on Republican wins in the Senate and anticipation that his party will retain the House as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally translated into particularly robust gains for financial and industrial companies, as well as for private prison stocks. Renewable energy companies were among the losers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The reaction today is just the fact that it was a clean sweep ... winning the election, the electoral vote, the popular vote, the Senate, and looking like they'll retain the House as well," said Aaron Clark, equity portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. "The market's clearly on a sugar high."
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains showed investor hopes about expected tax cuts and regulatory easing more than offset worries about higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A swift and decisive outcome reduces the risks of protracted uncertainty, political violence, recession risks, and even geopolitical spillover that could have accompanied presidential election outcome uncertainty," said Prestige Economics' Jason Schenker.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big winners in the post-election rally included Trump Media & Technology Group, home to the president-elect's Truth Social platform, as well as Tesla, which is led by Trump mega-supporter Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump Media rose 5.9 percent and Tesla piled on 14.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big financial companies also soared in expectation of an easing in strict banking rules. JPMorgan Chase won 11.6 percent and Goldman Sachs soared 13.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  CoreCivic and GEO Group, which manage immigration detention centres, both jumped on expectations of more investment. CoreCivic won nearly 29 percent while GEO Group won more than 42 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But renewable energy producers and other companies focused on sustainability were under pressure. This group included Enphase Energy, down 16.8 percent, and First Solar, down 10.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and mainland shares fell while US stock futures rose sharply hours before the opening of markets on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump claimed victory in the American presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  The greenback surged and bitcoin hit a record high, with traders ramping up bets on fresh tax cuts, tariffs and rising inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index snapped a three-day winning streak, finishing 468 points or 2.2 percent lower at 20,538.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland stocks also closed lower, with the Shanghai Composite Index down 0.09 percent to 3,383 and the Shenzhen Component Index losing 0.35 percent at 10,968.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the prospect of another Trump presidency and Republican control of US Congress risked heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington over trade and technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we’ve seen between 2016-20 other levers that can be pulled to contain China," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Although both candidates are probably hawkish toward China, Trump is still less predictable in terms of policy, so the prospect of a Trump win could still drag sentiment a bit," said Kenny Ng, strategist at China Everbright Securities International.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock futures were up 2.2 percent for the Dow, 2 percent for the broad-based S&P 500 and 1.7 percent for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US dollar jumped 1.5 percent to 154.38 yen, its highest since July, while it was also up more than 1 percent against the euro and more than 3 percent against the Mexican peso.
  <br>
  <br>
  The offshore yuan fell more than 1 percent versus the greenback, to its weakest since mid-August.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin sprung US$6,000 higher to a record US$75,371.69, topping its previous peak of US$73,797.98 in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has pledged to make the United States the "bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world" and to put tech billionaire Elon Musk in charge of a wide-ranging audit of governmental waste.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The price of bitcoin has closely followed Trump's position in the polls and on betting markets," Russ Mould, an analyst at AJ Bell, said ahead of Tuesday's US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are "potentially taking the view that a Republican victory would lead to a surge in demand for the digital currency", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Esho, economist and founder at Esho Capital, said: "The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, bouncing back from the prior session's declines in a benign session held as voters went to the polls in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters have for weeks pointed to a neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the market is saying is that the economy has continued to hold up even in the face of all this uncertainty that we have," said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, who pointed to a host of potentially market-moving policy areas affected by the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 1.0 percent at 42,221.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent to 5,782, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 18,439.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 pushed higher, led by consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology equities also advanced, including Netflix, which won 1.1 percent despite a raid of the company's offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday as part of a tax fraud probe, according to a judicial source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing dropped 2.6 percent as a machinist union voted to accept the company's latest contract offer, ending a more than seven week strike that closed two assembly plants in the Seattle area. The new contract includes a 38 percent wage hike. (AFP)
