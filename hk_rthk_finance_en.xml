    Economic boost amid deficit 'main challenge': FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday warned that promoting economic development amid a fiscal deficit would be Hong Kong's "main challenge", saying the government is studying how to boost income and cut costs to achieve a balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's "Voices from the Hall", where he gathered public feedback ahead of the upcoming budget, Chan said Hong Kong's economy grew steadily in the first three quarters of 2024 but not as strongly as expected due to high interest rates and geopolitical factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government is focusing on cost-cutting to tackle a deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although we need to move forward with public works projects and develop the Northern Metropolis, we have to prioritise developments according to their urgency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we need to study how to increase revenue, based on the principle that people who can afford to pay more do pay more, to minimise the impact on Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong's property slump would drop in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our property market has been experiencing an adjustment period, due to external factors and the high interest rate environment, among other reasons," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] property prices in Hong Kong have stabilised and transaction volume has increased."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the government will not restore a land-sale mechanism, which was scrapped more than a decade ago, in response to an attendee's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abolished in 2013, the application-based mechanism had allowed developers to apply for, and then offer a price for sites listed by the government, before authorities put the plot up for sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the government takes the lead with every quarterly land sale. We can assess the situation to see how many plots of land we're putting up for sale, what type of land is being sold, and how we're going to put those parcels out to market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After some attendees wanted to discuss the government's HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, the financial chief said labour and welfare officials are studying different views on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary is set to deliver his next budget speech on February 26.

<img alt="Wall Street closed higher on Friday, but still lost ground over the week. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786083_1_20250104053256.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks rebounded on Friday as investors neared the end of a holiday-shortened week that also rang in a new year, which brought with it expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts and looser regulatory policies from the incoming administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  A broad rally sent all three major US stock indexes to a higher close, with megacap growth companies, such as Tesla and Nvidia, providing much of the muscle to the upside and putting the Nasdaq out front.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even so, all three indexes posted modest declines for the week, with the S&P 500 logging its third weekly loss in four.
  <br>
  <br>
  A multi-session selloff put a dour finish on what was a banner year for the equities market, as continued momentum of artificial intelligence technology and the U.S. Federal Reserve's first policy rate cuts in three-and-a-half years helped fuel double-digit gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "After the late-in-the-year weakness, and a very oversold market, we finally saw some buyers step in," said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha. "Obviously the past week-and-a-half has been disappointing for the bulls, but volume has been light and there hasn't been a lot of news."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Let's just remember, starting next week, on Monday, that's when a lot of the big money managers come back to the desk," Detrick added. "We'll see if this bullish trend can continue."
  <br>
  <br>
  On the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers' index (PMI) surprised to the upside by gaining 0.9 point to 49.3, its highest reading since March, nudging ever closer to expansion territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  A run of fairly robust economic data has called into question the need for additional interest rate cuts from the Fed in the near term due to the possibility of re-igniting inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said the US 2025 economic outlook was positive, despite uncertainty about the impact of trade and other policies that may be pursued by the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The newly elected Congress convened for its first session on Friday, and US President-elect Donald Trump is expected to take the oath of office on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump's proposals - which include cutting corporate taxes, easing regulations and imposing tariffs - could boost corporate profits and energize the economy, they also risk placing upward pressure on inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 339.86 points, or 0.80 percent, to 42,732.13, the S&P 500 gained 73.92 points, or 1.26 percent, to 5,942.47 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 340.89 points, or 1.77 percent to 19,621.68.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Biden blocked the proposed sale of US Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel for US$14.9 billion, citing national security concerns. US Steel's shares dropped 6.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft shares gained 1.1 percent after the company said it would invest US$80 billion on AI-enabled data centers in fiscal 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcohol producers lost some ground after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said that alcoholic drinks should carry a label warning of cancer risks. Molson Coors and Brown Forman slid by 3.4 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. (Reuters)

    US blocks Nippon Steel's bid to purchase US Steel

<img alt="Nippon Steel has argued that its investments would shore up US Steel's output. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786056_1_20250103212811.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's US$14.9 billion bid for US Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly US$3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also represents the final chapter in a high profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where US Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up US Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks. (Reuters)

<img alt="Wall Street closed lower as investors weighed up their best strategy to deal with a strong US dollar and labour market. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785945_1_20250103052420.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street see-sawed to a lower close on Thursday amid choppy trading, as investors tackled the new year having to contend with a strong labour market, a rising dollar and tumbling Tesla shares.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US stocks ended the session in negative territory, a reversal of an earlier rally but off session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We had some macro news but somewhat mixed and you know we have a very strong dollar today," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. "There are a few hurdles over the next couple of weeks and those are next Friday’s employment data and the beginning of fourth quarter earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, we’re looking at choppiness and a struggle for direction until we get those hurdles out of the way," Cardillo added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla sank after reporting its first annual drop in deliveries, as incentives failed to stem a decline in demand for its ageing line-up of electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  A report from the Labor Department showed initial and continuing claims for unemployment benefits both fell last week, supporting the narrative of a solid jobs market and adding weight to the possibility that the US central bank could let its key interest rate stand at this month's policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking past uncertainties regarding the pace of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, policies to be enacted by the incoming Donald Trump administration and various hot spots of geopolitical unrest, market participants chose to focus on the strength of the United States economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes notched double-digit gains in 2024, with the benchmark S&P 500 recording its best two-year run since 1997-1998. Those gains were driven by the US Federal Reserve's first rate cuts in three-and-a-half years, the ongoing artificial intelligence boom and expectations of pro-business policies from the incoming Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rally lost steam in the closing weeks of 2024, with the S&P 500 and the Dow marking declines for December, as markets priced in the likelihood of fewer rate cuts from the Fed this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 13.07 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,868.56 points, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 30.00 points, or 0.16 percent, to 19,280.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 151.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 42,392.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P and the Nasdaq have now posted five consecutive sessions in the red, their longest losing streak since mid-April.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple is offering rare discounts of up to 500 yuan (US$68.5) on its latest iPhone models in China, as the US tech giant moves to defend its market share against rising competition from domestic rivals like Huawei.
 <br>
  <br>
  The four-day promotion, running from January 4 to 7, applies to several iPhone models when purchased using specific payment methods, according to its website.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flagship iPhone 16 Pro with a starting price of 7,999 yuan and the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a starting price of 9,999 yuan will see the highest discount of 500 yuan. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will receive a 400 yuan reduction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple is grappling with declining market share in China, the world's largest smartphone market, where local manufacturers have intensified competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Huawei has emerged as a particularly strong challenger since its return to the premium segment in August 2023 with locally-made chipsets. Huawei had cut the prices of a variety of high-end devices, including mobile phones, by up to 3,000 yuan over the weekend on one of China's leading e-commerce platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple briefly fell out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2024 before recovering in the third quarter. The US company's smartphone sales in China still slipped 0.3 percent during the third quarter from a year earlier, while Huawei's sales surged 42 percent, according to research firm IDC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Apple promotion also includes discounts of 200 to 300 yuan on older iPhone models, as well as other categories of products such as MacBook laptops and iPad tablets. Customers must use designated payment methods including WeChat Pay or Alipay to qualify for the discounts. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales were down 7.3 percent in November on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It marked the ninth consecutive month of year-on-year declines, following a 2.8 percent skid in October and 6.9 percent drop in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic drop in November, at 34.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales plunged 7.1 percent in the first 11 months of last year, compared to the same period in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the declines continued because of a change in people's consumption patterns and the relatively strong Hong Kong dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, the introduction of various measures by the Central Government to boost the mainland economy and benefit Hong Kong, including the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry Individual Visit Scheme for Shenzhen since December, together with the SAR Government's various initiatives to boost market sentiment, as well as increasing employment earnings, would be conducive to spending by both visitors and residents in the local market," a spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said he is hopeful sales will rebound this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The resumption of multiple-entry visas for Shenzhen is a good start to drive foot traffic, and the positive impact on the market starting December will take time to take effect," he said in an online press call.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking forward to 2025, the positive impact of various supportive measures are expected to gradually materialise to benefit all retail categories."

    Russian gas transit to Europe via Ukraine ends

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian gas exports via Soviet-era pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, marking the end of decades of Moscow's dominance over Europe's energy markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The gas had kept flowing despite nearly three years of war, but Russia's gas firm Gazprom said it had stopped after Ukraine refused to renew a transit agreement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The widely-expected stoppage will not impact prices for consumers in the European Union - unlike in 2022, when falling supplies from Russia sent prices to record highs, worsened a cost-of-living crisis and hit the bloc's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The last remaining EU buyers of Russian gas via Ukraine, such as Slovakia and Austria, have arranged alternative supplies, while Hungary will keep receiving Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline under the Black Sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova also reliant on the transit flows, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households early on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to dress warmly, hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said the EU had prepared for the cut-off.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin," a spokesperson for the Commission said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It has been reinforced with significant new LNG (liquefied natural gas) import capacities since 2022."
  <br>
  <br>
  Russia and the former Soviet Union spent half a century building up a major share of the European gas market, which at its peak stood at around 35 percent. But the EU has slashed its dependence on Russian energy since the start of the war in Ukraine by buying more piped gas from Norway, and LNG from Qatar and the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ukraine, which refused to extend the transit deal, said Europe had already made the decision to abandon Russian gas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses," Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko said in a statement. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks slipped on Tuesday to end 2024 on a gloomy note, but investors capped a strong overall year that was boosted by tech stocks, interest rate cuts and a robust US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones lost 0.1 percent to 42,544, while the S&P 500 Index declined 0.4 percent to 5,881.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent to 19,310.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was kind of a disappointing end to the year," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers, noting that markets have closed lower for a few consecutive days.
  <br>
  <br>
  He believed the selling in recent days involved "some large portfolios reallocating money from stocks."
  <br>
  <br>
  But "this year was phenomenal" overall, he said, noting that major indexes moved higher and major tech stocks dominated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was up around 13 percent from a year ago while the S&P 500 added more than 23 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 29 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key factors included semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks, with enthusiasm around Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping the "Magnificent Seven" US tech heavyweights – which include Apple and Nvidia – this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Concerns about the pace of US interest rate cuts and uncertainty over President-elect Donald Trump's trade and tariff agenda could cloud the outlook, however.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sosnick believed "there's a lot of optimism about the coming year." (AFP)

<img alt="Chinese manufacturing activity continued to expand in December, although at a slower rate than in November. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785626_1_20241231161725.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Manufacturing in China continued to expand in December, official data showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector was 50.1 in December, down from 50.3 in November, but staying above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third consecutive month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the steady expansion of the PMI suggested the combination of macroeconomic policies continued to take effect during the month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data showed that the production and new orders sub-indices came in at 52.1 and 51, respectively. This indicates momentum in the sector's production and market demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Driven by the country's consumer goods trade-in programme and the upcoming traditional holiday season, the PMI for the consumer goods sector came in at 51.4, up 0.6 points from the previous month, according to the NBS.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for the equipment manufacturing sector remained above 50 for a fifth straight month, with its December reading at 50.6.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's US$18 trillion economy has struggled to recover from the pandemic amid weak consumption and investment, and a protracted property crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, policymakers hope a recent blitz of fiscal and monetary measures will spark a turnaround in the property market, which has dragged on the broader economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Improved domestic demand could benefit manufacturers amid a global economic slowdown, reducing the impact of US President-elect Donald Trump's proposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets closed lower on the penultimate trading day of a year in which the benchmark indices have notched up strong gains.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.0 percent to 42,573.73, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent to 5,906.94, and the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.2 percent to 19,486.79.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Sam Stovall of CFRA stressed that there was no major catalyst behind the shift, and the lead-up to New Year's Day was typically a low-volume period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, he expected that investors would be closely eyeing data that could give the US Federal Reserve reason to hold back on rate cuts, such as consumer inflation readings.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets have already reacted to President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls, investors are also monitoring further details of his trade policy -- after his threats of sweeping new tariffs on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some major tech stocks slumped Monday, with Tesla shares dropping 3.3 percent and Facebook parent Meta losing 1.4 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) said it will expand its overseas network in search for more investment opportunities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Startups in Hong Kong employed about 18-thousand people this year, according to the agency, which was a seven percent growth year-on-year, making a substantial contribution to the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK's director-general, Alpha Lau, said on Saturday that the government spent a lot of effort in promoting emerging sectors and companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The 2024 startup survey shows that we have got a remarkable growth in the total number of startups. Now we have 4,700, up 10 percent from last year," she said in an interview with the Information Services Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This year we have seen some new sectors emerging, indicating that the Hong Kong government’s effort to promote industries in this area has now seen a very good result."
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO of a local fintech startup, Ben Wong, said Hong Kong's well-established financial structure was vital for his company's development.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We want to be an international company and Hong Kong provides us with that base on the strategic location. In just a four-hour ride we are able to go into Southeast Asia," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The talent in Hong Kong to me, when it comes to being able to support a financial business, is one of the best in the world. They are highly skilled, and also highly knowledgeable, in helping us grow our business. At the same time, we have been able to also attract international talent."
  <br>
  <br>
  InvestHK said it will particularly focus on countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and that a new office will be established in Turkey in the first quarter of next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks stumbled on Friday as major companies saw their shares fall towards the end of a holiday week.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.8 percent to 42,992, while the broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.1 percent to 5,970.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 1.5 percent to 19,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers said the sell-off caught many people by surprise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think a lot of people got very complacent about the idea that we would have a Santa Claus rally," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to a tendency for markets to fare well in the last five trading days of the year, and the first two in the new year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The selling is very much across-the-board. There's not an obvious catalyst for it today," said Sosnick, noting that the trend was more ferocious as volumes were light.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major companies in particular saw their shares fall, with Microsoft slipping 1.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon lost 1.4 percent, while Nvidia dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital said the slump was both a "year-end adjustment" and due to a rise in US Treasury bond yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's putting the brakes on, applying the brakes to the market," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished a low-key session little changed on Thursday as US Treasury bond yields retreated and a report pointed to higher holiday retail sales.
 <br>
  <br>
  Holiday consumer data showed a 3.8 percent increase in US retail spending from November 1 to December 24, according to a Mastercard SpendingPulse review of a key period for retailers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Solid spending during this holiday season underscores the strength we observed from the consumer all year," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist for the Mastercard Economics Institute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equities veered in and out of positive territory throughout the post-Christmas trading round when several overseas bourses were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.1 percent at 43,325.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent to 6,037, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.1 percent to 20,020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology companies that have led the market in much of 2024 mostly took a breather. These included Netflix, Tesla and Amazon, all of which declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, United States Steel fell 3 percent after would-be acquirer Nippon Steel of Japan pushed back the time-frame of its targeted acquisition to the first quarter of 2025 from the fourth quarter of 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move came after a US government panel could not reach consensus on whether the transaction harmed US national security, pushing the decision to President Joe Biden, who has criticised the takeover. (AFP)

<img alt="Remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month boosted regional sentiment. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1785073_1_20241226183315.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian stocks rose in thin Boxing Day trade on Thursday, extending a "Santa Rally" with key markets Hong Kong and Sydney still shut for the holidays.
 <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei index closed up 1.1 percent, boosted by comments from the Bank of Japan governor and share price gains for top-selling automaker Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's plans for massive bond issuances in 2025 also bolstered investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though many in the region are still shaking off a bit of a holiday hangover, with several markets closed for Boxing Day, Asian stocks opened higher, riding a favourable wave from China's financial bond juggernaut," said Stephen Innes from SPI Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Bangkok and Taipei all edged up 0.1 percent, while Seoul lost 0.4 percent and Singapore shed 0.1 percent. Jakarta and Wellington were closed.
  <br>
  <br>
  London Stockton, an analyst at Ned Davis Research, noted that the "Santa Claus rally could still be alive, with strong seasonality into the end of the year."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets have traditionally fared well in the last five trading days of the year and the first two in the new year, a trend known as the "Santa Claus rally."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among a number of possible reasons advanced by experts include the festive holiday mood and purchasing ahead of the end of the tax year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said remarks from Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda in which he refrained from signalling a potential interest rate hike next month also "influenced bullish regional sentiments."
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese market heavyweight Toyota ended nearly six percent higher after reports in the Nikkei business daily said it aimed to double its return on equity – a key measure of a company's financial performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  In thin corporate news on Thursday, Japan Airlines reported a cyberattack that caused delays to domestic and international flights and prompted a temporary halt to ticket sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  However later in the day the carrier said its systems had been restored after the "large data attack."
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets had been closed across Europe and North America for Christmas. The Dow Jones closed up 0.9 percent on the eve, while the tech-heavy S&P 500 rallied 1.1 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street's main indexes all closed higher on Tuesday, with gains in megacap and growth stocks bolstering benchmarks in a truncated Christmas Eve session.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite scored four straight sessions of gains, with the S&P 500 taking its winning streak to three sessions, marking the first day of the seasonal Santa Claus rally.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks climbed on Tuesday, led by the 7.4 percent jump in Tesla shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, chip manufacturers were also buoyant. Broadcom and Nvidia rose 3.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 65 points, or 1.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 266 points, or 1.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 390 points, or 0.9 percent, to 43,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets in the US will be closed for Christmas on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  American Airlines' shares edged up 0.6 percent after trading lower for much of the session. The carrier briefly grounded all its flights in the US on Tuesday due to an unspecified technical issue. (Reuters)

    China slams latest probe into semiconductor industry

<img alt="" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784775_2_20241224090533.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Monday it "resolutely opposed" to a US investigation into its semiconductor industry, calling it "protectionist".
 <br>
  <br>
  "The US 301 investigation has obvious unilateral and protectionist tones," the Commerce Ministry said in a statement, calling on Washington to immediately stop its "wrong practices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The Biden administration announced a last-minute trade investigation into older Chinese-made "legacy" semiconductors that could heap more US tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from cars to washing machines to telecoms gear.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the probe aimed to protect American and other semiconductor producers from China's domestic chip supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  The "Section 301" probe, launched four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty 60 percent tariffs he has threatened on Chinese imports.
  <br>

  Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50 percent US tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on January 1. His administration also has tightened export curbs on advanced artificial intelligence and memory chips and chipmaking equipment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Legacy chips use older manufacturing processes introduced more than a decade ago and are often far simpler than chips used in AI applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday her department's research showed that two-thirds of US products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of US companies did not know the origin of their chips, including some in the defence industry, findings that were "fairly alarming."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said in a statement that the US chips probe would hurt American firms and disrupt the global chip supply chain. It said Beijing would "take all necessary measures to firmly defend its rights and interests." (Agencies)

 US markets shook off early weakness and pushed higher on Monday, propelled by gains in Nvidia and some other large tech equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had been under pressure early amid concerns over higher US Treasury bond yields that impede year-end gains in a historically strong period of the calendar.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Stocks didn't really have any direction in the morning, then we got this tech rally that just sort of drifted higher all day," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.2 percent at 42,906.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.7 percent to 5,974.07, while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.0 percent to 19,764.89.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks dropped last week after the Federal Reserve signalled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the market rose progressively in a quiet session with analysts pointing to low pre-holiday trading volumes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among economic releases, US consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in December amid concerns over the potential economic drag of new tariffs threatened by President-elect Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US consumer confidence index slipped to 104.7 in December, down from a revised 112.8 last month, The Conference Board announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qualcomm climbed 3.5 percent after a jury sided with it in a legal dispute with Arm over alleged breach of license agreements connected to Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia. Arm Holdings fell 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nordstrom fell 1.6 percent after Mexican investment group El Puerto de Liverpool and members of the Nordstrom family reached a deal that involves taking the department store chain private. The transaction is valued at US$6.25 billion, Nordstrom said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will have a half session on Tuesday, Christmas Eve, followed by Wednesday's holiday. (AFP)

    Stellantis backtracks over planned Jeep layoffs

<img alt="Stellantis brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784548_1_20241222073225.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stellantis confirmed on Saturday it was reversing a decision to lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep plant in the US state of Ohio, following the ouster of embattled chief executive Carlos Tavares.
 <br>
  <br>
  "No employees will be placed on indefinite layoff on January 5, 2025, due to the previously announced shift reduction. Employees are expected to return to work as scheduled after the new year," a Stellantis spokesperson said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decision comes as "Stellantis continues to reassess its strategy in North America," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automaker had announced the job cuts at the plant in Toledo, Ohio in early November, saying it was part of an effort to "regain its competitive edge" amid struggles with falling sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, a 14-brand group that includes Chrysler, Peugeot and Fiat, had planned to trim operations at the Toledo South Assembly Plant from two shifts to one.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another 400 employees were to be transferred to a "third-party service provider."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis sales sank in the third quarter, with a 42 percent drop in North America alone. The group offered promotional deals as US dealerships struggled to reduce their inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Stellantis has significantly revised its approach since Tavares's December 1 exit, with the new interim CEO giving guarantees to the French and Italian governments on maintaining its production and investments in both countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The French-Italian-American company had 258,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2003. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week higher. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784456_1_20241221074028.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets rebounded on Friday following a pullback in US Treasury yields as markets braced for a looming US government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the reading came in lower than expected, prompting a pullback in US Treasury bond yields that had risen after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled earlier this week they expect fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after the Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on Friday, the broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,930.85, up 1.1 percent for the day but down about two percent for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2 percent to 42,840.26 and the Nasdaq Composite: was up1.0 percent at 19,572.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen a nice rebound from what was, in our view, an overreaction to the Fed's outlook on Wednesday," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones, pointing to Friday's inflation data as a supportive factor for equities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Treasury yields pulled back following comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, who expressed confidence that the PCE data showed that inflation was returning to the Fed's target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the next 12 to 18 months, rates can still go down a fair amount," Goolsbee told CNBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also keeping watch on developments in Capitol Hill.
  <br>
  <br>
  US lawmakers raced to stave off a government shutdown set to bite within hours after Donald Trump and Elon Musk sabotaged a bipartisan agreement that would have averted a shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  If no deal is struck, the government will cease to be funded at midnight, and non-essential operations will start to grind to halt, with up to 875,000 workers furloughed and 1.4 million more required to work without pay.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stocks finished the day lower although they cut their losses as Wall Street rebounded, with data showing tepid retail sales in the UK in the runup to Christmas dampening sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Nike dipped 0.2 percent as it reported lower earnings while new CEO Elliott Hill outlined steps to get the slumping sports giant back on track. Analysts pointed to Nike's near-term outlook, which suggests a turnaround will not be quick.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carnival jumped 6.4 percent following an upbeat 2025 forecast that included a 20 percent rise in profits to $2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure rose for a second straight month in November according to government data published on Friday, although the increase came in a touch below expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 2.4 percent in the 12 months to November, up from 2.3 percent in October, and 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, headline prices rose just 0.1 percent from October, pointing to a slight slowdown in what is sure to be welcome news for the US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was slightly below the median forecasts from economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, triggering a sharp sell-off in the financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The independent US central bank is responsible for tackling inflation and unemployment, largely by hiking or lowering interest rates to affect demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  This indirectly impacts the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, affecting everything from mortgages to car loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, the core PCE price index was up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and by 0.1 percent from a month earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both figures were slightly below expectations. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street closed the session barely changed. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784276_1_20241220070718.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished little changed on Thursday as Treasury bond yields climbed further in the wake of a Federal Reserve decision that prompted deep selling in the prior session.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices bounced early in the day, but the rebound faded as the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday lowered interest rates but signaled it expects fewer interest rate cuts in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose less than 0.1 percent to 42,342.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,867.08, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.1 percent to 19,372.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  Thursday's move in stocks is "kind of a lacklustre recovery effort," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of good news has been priced into this market," he said. "And now the market is going to sit back and see if a lot of that good news that's priced in actually comes to fruition."
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were monitoring Capitol Hill where an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump on a spending bill raised the possibility of a government shutdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Micron Technology sank 16.2 percent after projecting earnings that lagged estimates. While the chip company benefited from strong demand for artificial intelligence, analysts pointed to a drag from weak demand for personal computers and automobile clients.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Darden Restaurants, which owns the Olive Garden and other chains, jumped 14.7 percent after projecting a 1.5 percent rise in same-restaurant sales for its full fiscal year. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property consultancy firm Cushman and Wakefield on Thursday said Hong Kong's property market will start to pick up next year, if the rate-cutting cycle continues.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company's executive director, Rosanna Tang, said transactions and prices have stabilised following three rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If interest rates continue to stay on a downward cycle and the Fed continue their rate cut policy and at the same time if the stock market could restore some of the momentum, then we expect the transaction volume in the residential market will continue to pick up and recover from this year's level. Then we can see the price rebound to follow in 2025," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major banks, including HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong), have announced they are lowering their prime lending rates for the third time this year, trimming the cost of borrowing to the lowest level in two years.

    Local property market shows signs of stabilising: HKMA

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday said the local property market showed signs of stabilising with transactions increasing steadily and prices rising marginally after the US Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September.
 <br>
  <br>
  With another quarter of a percentage point cut overnight, the Fed has cut interest rates by an accumulative 100 basis points since September.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA's chief executive Eddie Yue said a lower borrowing cost environment would be beneficial to the local economy and the real estate market, reducing the loan burden of home buyers. But he stressed there are many other factors affecting the economy and the housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said whether local borrowing costs would drop further following the latest cut by the Fed would depend on local funding supply.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks will normally take into account factors like funding supply and demand in the interbank market, the level of interbank rates, and their own funding cost structure to assess the merits and extent of adjustment if there's any," Yue said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on borrowers to exercise caution as the future outlook on interest rate cuts remains uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates might still remain at a relatively high level for some time and the extent and pace of future interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty. The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA reduced the base rate to 4.75 percent with immediate effect on Thursday according to the established mechanism.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) announced cuts in their best lending rates in Hong Kong by 12.5 basis points to 5.25 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new lending rates take effect at HSBC on Friday and at Bank of China (Hong Kong) next Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lenders were also trimming their savings rate by the same margin to 0.25 percent per annum on deposits above HK$5,000.

<img alt="The US Supreme Court decided on Wednesday to hear a bid by TikTok and its China-based parent company ByteDance to block a law intended to force the sale of the app or face a ban. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784110_1_20241219083509.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear TikTok's appeal of a law that would force its Chinese owner to sell the online video-sharing platform or shut it down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The top court scheduled oral arguments in the case for January 10, nine days before TikTok faces a ban unless ByteDance divests from the popular app.
  <br>
  <br>
  The law, signed by US President Joe Biden in April, would block TikTok from US app stores and web hosting services unless ByteDance sells its stake by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok is arguing that the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, violates its First Amendment free speech rights.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Congress has enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," TikTok said in a filing with the Supreme Court.
  <br>
  <br>
  Should the law take effect, it would "shutter one of America's most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration," TikTok said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Applicants - as well as countless small businesses who rely on the platform - also will suffer substantial and unrecoverable monetary and competitive harms."
  <br>
  <br>
  A TikTok spokesman said the company was "pleased with today's Supreme Court order."
  <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference on Monday, incoming US President Donald Trump said he had "a warm spot" for TikTok and that his administration would take a look at the app and the potential ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  It marks a reversal from his first term, when the Republican leader tried to ban the app over security concerns. (AFP)

    US stocks tumble as Fed eyes fewer 2025 rate cuts

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street took a dive after the Federal Reserve indicated fewer rate cuts next year. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784092_1_20241219053202.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates but also slashed the number of 2025 rate cuts in its forecast.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly lower after the Fed projected just two interest rate cuts next year, down from four.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow slid 2.6 percent, or more than 1,100 points, to 42,326.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 3.0 percent to 5,872, while the Nasdaq slumped 3.6 percent to 19,392.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Seeing the kind of decline we are experiencing right now indicates that the Fed took the market quite by surprise," said CFRA Research's Sam Stovall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although stocks often enjoy a late-year bounce referred to as the "Santa Claus rally," Stovall said the depth of Wednesday's drop could spur more selling if traders take profits.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Maybe Santa is already on vacation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US central bank, as expected, moved ahead with a decision to reduce interest rates by a quarter point as Fed Chair Jerome Powell offered an upbeat appraisal of the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the announcement was coupled with the altered outlook on 2025 monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the latest interest rate cut, the Fed is now "significantly closer" to the point where no further cuts will be needed, said Powell, who emphasised the central bank still views two percent inflation as a critical long-term priority.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's reaction suggests the investors are "grappling" with the likelihood that interest rates "for all intents and purposes, are going to remain higher for longer," said Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's losses were broad-based with 29 of 30 companies in the Dow ending lower and all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finishing in the red. (AFP)

<img alt="This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784091_1_20241219051243.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday and signalled a slower pace of cuts ahead, amid uncertainty about inflation and President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans.
 <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers voted 11-to-1 to lower the US central bank's key lending rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed announced in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In updated economic forecasts, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee pencilled in just two quarter-point rate cuts in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of four, and hiked their inflation outlook for next year, from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed has made progress in tackling inflation through interest rate hikes in the last two years, and recently began paring back rates to boost demand in the economy and support the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But in the last couple of months, the Fed's favoured inflation measure has ticked higher, moving away from the bank's long-term target of two percent, and raising concerns that the US central bank's battle is not over.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is the final planned interest rate decision before outgoing Democratic President Joe Biden makes way for Republican Donald Trump, whose economic proposals include tariff hikes and the mass deportation of millions of undocumented workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  These plans, combined with the recent uptick in inflation data, led some analysts to pare back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 ahead of Wednesday's meeting, predicting that interest rates will need to remain higher for longer. (AFP)

<img alt="Japanese auto giants Honda and Nissan are in preliminary merger talks as a way to deal with the growing competition to their business from EVs. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1784003_1_20241218151346.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Honda and Nissan are in talks to deepen ties, media reports said on Wednesday, including a possible merger, the clearest sign yet of how Japan's once seemingly unbeatable auto industry is being reshaped by challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals.
 <br>
  <br>
  A combined Honda and Nissan would create a US$54 billion company with annual output of 7.4 million vehicles, making it the world's third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two firms had already forged a strategic partnership in March to cooperate in electric vehicle development, but Nissan's deepening financial and strategic trouble in recent months has added more urgency for closer cooperation with larger rival Honda.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nissan announced a US$2.6 billion cost savings plan last month that includes cutting 9,000 jobs and 20 percent of its global production capacity, as slumping sales in China and the US led to a 85 percent plunge in second-quarter profit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This deal appears to be more about bailing out Nissan, but Honda itself is not resting on its laurels," said Sanshiro Fukao, executive fellow at Itochu Research Institute. "Honda's cash flow is set to deteriorate next year and its EVs haven't been going so well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nissan closed nearly 24 percent higher in Tokyo trade on Wednesday, while shares of Honda, whose market value of US$43 billion is more than four times bigger than that of Nissan, declined three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Mitsubishi gained nearly 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The automakers have been grappling with challenges from EV makers, particularly in China, where BYD and others have surged ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  The talks between Honda and Nissan, first reported by the Nikkei newspaper, would allow the companies to cooperate more on technology and help them create a more formidable domestic rival to Toyota.
  <br>
  <br>
  The discussions are focused on finding ways to bolster collaboration and include the possibility of setting up a holding company, said the people, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.
  <br>
  <br>
  The companies are also discussing the possibility of full merger, according to one of the people, as well as looking at ways to cooperate with Mitsubishi Motors, in which Nissan is the top shareholder with a 24 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi said no deal had been announced by any of the companies, though Nissan and Mitsubishi noted the three automakers had said previously they were considering opportunities for future collaboration.
  <br>
  <br>
  French automaker Renault, a major Nissan shareholder, said it had no information and declined to comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The three Japanese automakers are expected to hold a joint news conference in Tokyo on Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter. (Reuters)

<img alt="Solid US retail sales data were not enough to boost sentiment on Wall Street. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783925_1_20241218061003.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks retreated on Tuesday despite solid US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve interest-rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq pulled back from its record in the prior session and was joined lower by the S&P 500 and the Dow, which fell for its ninth straight session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is just sort of a pause here," said Art Hogan from B Riley Wealth Management, who noted equities had rallied after the US presidential election.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.6 percent at 43,449.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.4 percent to 6,050, while the Nasdaq shed 0.3 percent to 20,109.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates again on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  If the US central bank's monetary policy outlook projects additional cuts in 2025 in line with expectations, Hogan said stocks could rally Wednesday; but a disappointing forecast could send stocks lower, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales rose 0.7 percent in November from a month earlier, up from a revised 0.5 percent in October and above analysts' forecasts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts attributed the positive numbers in part to the speedy resolution of the US presidential contest.

  Among individual companies, Pfizer jumped 4.8 percent as it projected slightly higher profits in 2025 compared with this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Online e-commerce platform eBay won 0.9 percent after announcing the board authorised an additional 43 billion for share repurchases. (AFP)

    Walmart, Meituan team up to boost e-commerce sales

<img alt="Meituan is China's biggest food delivery company that also provides bike-sharing and ticket booking among other services. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783897_1_20241217212845.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Walmart said on Tuesday it had formed a strategic partnership with Meituan, under which the Chinese firm has begun providing delivery services for Walmart goods and the US company will be featured on its popular app.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move will help Walmart accelerate its e-commerce business in China, which accounts for nearly half of its sales in the country, Walmart's China unit said in a WeChat post.
  <br>
  <br>
  The partnership follows Walmart's sale of a stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com for US$3.7 billion in August, allowing it to diversify beyond JD's logistics services.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meituan is China's biggest food delivery company but also provides a host of other services that range from deliveries of other goods to bike-sharing and ticket booking.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the company most Chinese consumers turn to when they want a quick delivery of basic household items and Walmart will become more visible by being on the Meituan app, said Jason Yu, general manager at CTR Market Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart last month reported that quarterly net sales in China, including sales from both Walmart and its members-only Sam's Club stores, surged 17 percent to US$4.9 billion. (Reuters)

 The Hong Kong stock market opened lower on Tuesday, with some investors apparently nervous ahead of a rate review in the United States.

  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.59 percent to 19,678.03 in the opening minutes.

  Earlier, US market closed mixed overnight, ahead of this week's meeting by the US Federal Reserve.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq surged to a fresh record Monday at the start of a heavy week of economic news that includes a US Federal Reserve rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  Large gains by chip company Broadcom, Google parent Alphabet and some other tech names helped lift the index 1.2 percent to 20,173.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 43,717, while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 6,074.

  Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments pointed to SoftBank's announcement that it would invest US$100 billion in the United States as being supportive of tech shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's renewed optimism in semiconductor and big tech stocks," Sarhan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said the market may take a breather until it receives key data points later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot to digest this week," Ablin said of a calendar that includes key retail sales and inflation data, as well as a Fed monetary policy decision. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump (right) and Masayoshi Son (left) say a planned investment by Softbank will create about 100,000 US jobs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783752_1_20241217022004.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump, with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at his side, announced on Monday that SoftBank would invest US$100 billion in the United States over the next four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said in his joint appearance with Son that the investment would create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and related infrastructure, with the money to be deployed before the end of Trump's term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the investment was evidence of "monumental confidence in America's future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$100 billion pledge, made at a flag-bedecked event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, fits in with Trump's vow to bolster the US economy and reduce the effect of inflation on Americans during his second term, which begins on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called Son "one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Monday announcement echoes a similar pledge Son made with then-President-elect Trump in December 2016 at Trump Tower, when Son said he would spend US$50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  While that money was eventually spent, it is unclear whether those jobs were created. The company has been rebuilding its finances after the failure of high-flying office-sharing start-up WeWork and after investors soured on some of the tech firms that it's invested in through its Vision Fund unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's unclear how SoftBank plans to fund the new investment. As of September 30, SoftBank had about US$29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent earnings report. After a sharp decline in shares between 2021 and 2023, its stock has recovered, gaining nearly 50 percent year-to-date. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index ended the week on Friday sharply lower, finishing down 2.09 percent to close at 19,971, its biggest decline in a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 US equity markets dipped fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq retreating below 20,000 following a US inflation report that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US wholesale inflation came in at 0.4 percent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 percent in October and higher than projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the inflation report, markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we're seeing profit-taking after a big day," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research, who viewed the inflation report as unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dropped 0.7 percent to 19,902.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 percent to 43,914.12, while the S&P 500 also shed 0.5 percent to 6,051.25.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock indices have scored repeat records since Donald Trump won the November 5 presidential election. The Republican took a victory lap on Thursday morning, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Adobe tumbled 13.7 percent on disappointment over the software giant's forecast for next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Warner Bros. Discovery surged 15.4 percent as it announced a reorganization, with one major division focused on operating television networks and the other focused on streaming and movie studios. (AFP)

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".
