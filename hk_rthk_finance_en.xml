<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set out by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

 Hong Kong stocks rose on Thursday following a jump on Wall Street, after the Trump administration delayed auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rose 392 points, or 1.67 percent, to open at 23,987 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  It soon soared past 24,000, reaching a three-year high.

    Wall Street rebounds after Trump pauses auto tariffs

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US President decided to "give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA", a North American free trade pact. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794487_1_20250306084640.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

<img alt="Zhou Yunjie, chairman of home appliances firm Haier, says technological innovation is a key factor to enable enterprises become international brands. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794332_2_20250305112824.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese companies are doubling down on innovation as part of efforts to contribute to the national drive of developing "new quality productive forces", with leaders convening in Beijing for the annual Two Sessions meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Lei Jun, the chairman of Xiaomi, which was originally a smartphone maker but has entered the electric vehicle (EV) space, said technological innovation aided his firm's meteoric rise in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investment in technological innovation reached 105 billion yuan over the past five years, which helped Xiaomi to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, selling some 170 million mobile phones last year, Lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of its internet-based smart home devices, meanwhile, also fared well, with some 900 million such items being sold, demonstrating the popularity of Chinese tech products around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lei, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said Xiaomi would continue to invest in technological research and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manufacturing is the foundation of China and the foundation of a strong country. Xiaomi, as a builder and beneficiary of the manufacturing industry, will continue to adhere to the path of striving for scientific and technological innovation as well as high-end development, ramp up the cultivation of new quality productive forces, apply the latest artificial intelligence technology to all our terminals, to let all consumers experience the wonderful life brought by technologies, and at the same time, contribute our efforts to the development of the Chinese-style modernisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence in the country's private sector, after attending a high-profile meeting with President Xi Jinping last month which indicated stronger support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lei, Zhou Yunjie, chairman of Chinese home appliances firm Haier, who is also an NPC deputy, said that technology helped boost the company's global ambitions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Scientific and technological innovation is a key factor for a brand whether it could stand strong in the world. If an enterprise aims to go global, it has to stick to technological innovation as its solid base, to keep on innovating - until it reaches the top, so that the brand could truly be a top leader. Haier has also been adhering to such a principle, we kept looking up to international standards until we reached breakthroughs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhou added that artificial intelligence was a new opportunity for China and that more Chinese firms would be able to create internationally recognised brands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said the nation will vigorously boost consumption and investment, with domestic demand becoming "the main engine and anchor of economic growth" as stated in his government work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures outlined is the issuance of 300 billion yuan of ultra-long treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said Beijing will adopt special measures to boost spending power, increase the supply of quality products and services, and improve the consumption environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will create a full range of new consumption scenarios to advance the growth of digital, green, smart, and other types of consumption. We will also introduce measures to unleash the consumption potential in culture and sports-related industries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said Beijing will expand effective investment and create greater synergy between fiscal and financial policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will implement new mechanisms for public-private partnership in a well-regulated manner and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects, thus creating more opportunities for the development of private capital," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that 735 billion yuan will be earmarked in the central government's budget for investment this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, observers believe government policies will not only lead to sustained growth this year but also lay the groundwork for the modernisation drive in the long run, as the country embarks on its next Five-Year Plan from 2026.

 Hong Kong stocks rose 1.13 percent at the open on Wednesday, after Premier Li Qiang announced a target GDP growth of "around 5 percent" for 2025 and pledged to make domestic demand the "main engine" of its economic growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was up 258 points at 23,200 at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  The GDP growth target was announced on Wednesday in a report being presented by Premier Li at the opening session of the National People's Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, stocks racked up more losses on Wall Street on Tuesday, as a trade war between the US and its key trading partners escalated.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting on Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. All three countries have announced retaliatory actions, sparking worries about a slowdown in the global economy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq veering near correction territory, as trade tensions escalated following US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with doubled duties on Chinese goods, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite ended lower after veering into correction territory during the session but pared losses in choppy trading. The index closed down 9.3 per cent from its record closing high on December 16.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in financials and industrials were the biggest losers among the benchmark S&P 500's 11 main sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 6.2 per cent and nearly 4 per cent, respectively, sending the bigger banks index down 4.7 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE market volatility index rose 3.20 per cent to its highest since December 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.55 per cent, to 42,520, the S&P 500 lost 1.22 per cent, to 5,778 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.35 per cent, to 18,285.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car makers Ford and General Motors, which have vast supply chains across North America, fell 2.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. The domestically focused Russell 2000 index dropped 1 per cent. (Reuters)

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=10">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

    China's economy solid amid challenges: NPC spokesman

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s economy has a solid foundation with new growth drivers despite facing some challenges in the coming year, a spokesman for the top legislature said on Tuesday, as dates for the parliament’s annual session were announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) will kick off on Wednesday and run until March 11, lasting for seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the session, Beijing is expected to announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Undoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought the external environment have deepened and China’s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,” Lou Qinjian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But it’s more important to note that China’s economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience and vast potential.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States doubling additional tariffs on Chinese imports, the spokesman said trade disputes should be settled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  “By imposing unilateral tariffs, the US has violated WTO rules and disrupted the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains,” Lou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the US can work in the same direction as China and find a solution through equal-footed consultation. China is also ready to work more closely with other countries to safeguard the hard-earned multilateral trading system, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and advance a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said the progress of DeepSeek reflects the rise of Chinese companies in artificial intelligence, saying such firms have become the backbone of the country’s science and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lou said while artificial intelligence technologies are accompanied by “unknown risks”, China attaches great importance to their development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing a range of between 10 and 15 percent hikes to import levies covering a basket of American agricultural and food products, while placing 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "An additional 15 percent tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton," the Finance Ministry said, adding "additional 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's unilateral tariffs measures seriously violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US," the Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, launching new trade conflicts with the top three US trading partners. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets in Hong Kong and on the mainland both opened lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the upcoming annual parliamentary sessions to gauge Beijing's policy path.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 328.02 points, or 1.43 per cent, to open at 22,678 points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Tech Index was down over three per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index dropped 0.6 per cent at the open, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market focus is shifting from the recent tech and AI themes to the National People's Congress meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing was expected to maintain its economic growth target at roughly five per cent and announce a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell more than one per cent in early trade, dragged by overnight Wall Street declines and a stronger yen, with US tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect as planned later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump also reaffirmed that he will increase tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent from the previous 10 per cent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump's announcement, Beijing warned on Tuesday that it would take countermeasures against new US tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated against the US dollar as the greenback slid, knocking down exporters shares and further dragging investor sentiment. (Agencies)

 US stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, after US President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions against China and levies on Mexico and Canada neared imposition, while European defence shares soared as the European Union sought increased military spending over Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had signed an executive order raising tariffs on China to 20 per cent, shortly after Trump seemed to rule out any change to the planned 25 per cent tariffs against Mexico and Canada.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent, while the broad-based S&P lost 1.8 per cent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq took a harsher tumble, closing down 2.6 per cent.

  The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX - colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" - surged, hitting its highest level since December.

  In Europe, BAE Systems surged 14 per cent, helping London's benchmark FTSE 100 index to a record high, the latest in a series over recent months.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said while Hong Kong's capital account, which is used to finance large infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis, was facing higher deficits, the city's operating account was still largely balanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On the operating account, our aim is to return it to balance as soon as possible, and start to register surplus. The coming [financial] year, in 2025-2026, we will be largely in balance. The deficit is only about HK$4 billion. When you take it into the context of the government expenditure of over HK$600 billion a year, I would call that largely balanced. And then the year after, 2026-2027, we [will] start to have an operating surplus," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the city must expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis so as to drive the SAR's technological growth, but that would also mean the government's capital account would be under an imbalanced fiscal situation in the short term due to the gap between revenue and expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to match the cash flow requirements, we can consider issuing some bonds with longer tenor. That is possible. But at the same time, I have to wait and balance between cost of borrowing and the tenor," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been concerns over the city's rising debt, given authorities' plan to issue up to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the coming five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan stressed the city's debt levels remain low and it should make good use of its borrowing capacity to meet the capital account cash flow gap.

<img alt="The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793951_1_20250303101834.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery," said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory production accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew five percent last year, reaching the official target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10 percent duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang emphasised the importance of timely policy support, saying "March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's largest bubble tea and drinks chain Mixue Group jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday after the firm raised HK$444 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
 <br>
  <br>
  Mixue sold 17 million shares in the deal at a fixed price of HK$202.50 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shares started trading at HK$262 each and the gains outpaced a 0.8 percent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail investors subscribed for 5,258 times more shares than were on offer in that tranche, according to Mixue's filings, making it one of Hong Kong's most popular ever IPOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail subscription rate was just below Bloks Group whose retail book was 6,000 times oversubscribed, a record, in its January IPO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institutional tranche of the deal was 35 times covered, the filings showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixue is often seen as China's largest chain of iced drinks, milk tea and ice cream. However, it operates more like a raw-material supplier than a traditional beverage brand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1997 as a small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Mixue has grown into a franchise giant with over 45,000 stores globally by September 2024, surpassing Starbucks' 40,576 stores worldwide. (Reuters)

 Asian share markets dithered on Monday as the threat of imminent tariffs lurked in the background, while bitcoin surged on news it would be included in a new US strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump on social media announced five digital assets he expected to include in a new reserve, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, shot up more than 11 percent to US$94,110, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed 14 percent to US$2,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, helped by a softer yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.1 percent, having staged a late rally on Friday after a week of heavy losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25 percent level.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 10 percent levy on Chinese imports is also due to come into effect this week, just as the National People's Congress opens its annual session on Wednesday. (Reuters)

    Trump orders trade investigation into lumber

<img alt="The probe also covers derivative products made from lumber which could include furniture such as kitchen cabinets. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793855_1_20250302091515.jpg&q=5">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Saturday ordered a new trade investigation that could heap more tariffs on imported lumber, adding to existing duties on Canadian softwood lumber and 25 percent tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods due next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  In his third new tariff probe in a week, Trump signed a memo ordering Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to initiate a national security investigation into US lumber imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The trade law is the one Trump also used to impose tariffs on global steel and aluminium imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe covers derivative products made from lumber which could include furniture such as kitchen cabinets, which in some cases are made of US lumber that had been exported.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order said the Commerce Department investigation must be completed within 270 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also ordered new steps within 90 days to increase the domestic supply of lumber by streamlining the permitting process for harvesting lumber from public lands and improving the salvage of fallen trees from forests and waterways.
  <br>
  <br>
  The order calls for new or updated agency guidance to facilitate increased timber production, including quicker approvals for forestry projects under the Endangered Species Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the lumber import probe would counteract the actions of big lumber exporters including Canada, Germany and Brazil, which he said were "dumping lumber into our markets at the expense of both our economic prosperity and national security."
  <br>
  <br>
  "That stops today with a pair of Trumpian actions designed to both bolster supply of and demand for American timber and lumber," he told reporters on a conference call ahead of the signing.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House official said that increasing reliance on imported lumber represents a possible national security risk partly because the US military consumes significant quantities of lumber for its construction activities and because increasing dependence on imports for a commodity with ample domestic supplies is a danger to the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official did not provide details on a proposed tariff rate under the Section 232 lumber probe, but Trump earlier this month told reporters that he was thinking about imposing a 25 percent tariff rate on lumber and forest products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said any tariffs resulting from the probe would be added to the existing 14.5 percent combined anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Canadian softwood lumber.
  <br>
  <br>
  These were the result of a long-running US-Canada trade dispute over Canada's low stumpage fees on public lands, which Washington argues is an unfair subsidy. Most US lumber is harvested from private land at market-determined rates. Home builders have long criticised the tariffs as raising lumber prices and contributing to home price inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said the new lumber duties also would stack on top of Trump's threatened 25 percent general US tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods that are scheduled to take effect on Tuesday unless Trump is persuaded by the two countries' efforts to secure their borders and halt fentanyl trafficking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new tariff probe follows Trump's order on Tuesday for a new Section 232 into copper imports, aimed at rebuilding US production of a metal critical to electric vehicles, military hardware and the power grid.
  <br>
  <br>
  On February 21, Trump ordered US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to revive investigations aimed at imposing tariffs on imports from countries that levy digital services taxes on U.S. technology companies. Canada would again be in the firing line for such penalties, along with France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, India and Turkey. (Reuters)

 CK Infrastructure Holdings is considering a bid for KKR-backed British waste management firm Viridor, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-based company is in talks with potential advisers as it evaluates a possible offer, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, Bloomberg reported that KKR is exploring options for Viridor including a sale that could value the business at as much as 7 billion pounds (US$8.8 billion) including debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Infrastructure and KKR did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment. A representative for CKI did not immediately respond to Bloomberg queries and KKR declined to comment to Bloomberg, the agency said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Viridor operates energy recovery through its facilities in the UK to generate energy from residual waste, according to their website. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity grew in February after a dip the previous month, official figures showed on Saturday, as the United States targets the country's exports with increased tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a key measure of industrial output - came in at 50.2 in February, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), above the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  February's reading was up from 49.1 in January, when factory activity shrank for the first time in four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Production was boosted in February by the "gradual resumption of work by enterprises after the Chinese New Year," said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the services sector, came in at 50.4 in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Xi Jinping has admitted the country's economy still faces "numerous difficulties".
  <br>
  <br>
  China's leadership convenes next week for the "Two Sessions" meetings, where analysts expect them to hammer out plans to shield the economy from tariffs and trade threats from the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump this week announced an additional 10 per cent tariff on Chinese imports, on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said it remained to be seen "how much will the US raise tariff next week, (and) how damaging will it be for China's export orders". (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Friday said it opposed US President Donald Trump's latest threat to impose an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports and vowed to take "all necessary countermeasures" if Chinese entities got caught up in the levies.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the ministry accused the US of "shifting the blame" on fentanyl flows into the United States and urged Washington to "return to the right track of properly resolving differences through dialogue on an equal footing as soon as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added China had some of the world's strictest anti-drug policies and highlighted the risks new tariffs would bring to global supply chains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday his proposed 25 percent tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods would take effect on Tuesday, along with the additional 10 percent levy on Chinese imports on top of an existing levy of the same rate imposed on China earlier this month. (Agencies)

    Home prices drop to almost 8.5-year low

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices retreated to their lowest level in nearly eight and a half years in January.
 <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department on Friday showed that the city's home price index dropped to 287.6, from 288.9 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marked a 0.4 percent decline on a monthly basis and a 6.5 percent retreat from a year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices had risen in October and November after cheaper borrowing costs attracted buyers to take the plunge.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at consultancy CBRE Hong Kong, said January was low season for the property market due to the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok also partially attributed the declines to developers rolling out new residential projects while also pushing existing inventories.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he said he expects a rebound later this year, noting that home prices are highly correlated with the city's stock market performances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If the Hang Seng Index remains at its current level or continue to increase, we expect residential prices for the secondary market to stabilise and potentially pick up going forward," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rental prices continued to edge up in January, with the official key gauge rising to its highest level in four months to stand at 192.9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday, extending a rough period as disappointment with Nvidia earnings and fresh tariff rhetoric from US President Donald Trump pressured the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  While Nvidia reported impressive profits, shares finished down 8.5 percent, with investors seemingly wanting more from the artificial intelligence company.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have gotten used to having Nvidia blow the door off," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "They did well but they didn't blow the door off."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin also cited remarks from Trump indicating that 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.5 percent at 43,239.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent to 5,861, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.8 percent to 18,544.
  <br>
  <br>
  After shooting to records earlier this month, US indices have struggled in recent sessions following a trove of lackluster economic data as Trump presses on with assertive trade policy and government job cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, weekly jobless claims exceeded estimates, while pending home sales also disappointed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other AI companies fell, including Arm Holdings, which lost 6.2 percent and Broadcom, which dropped 7.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Salesforce fell 4.0 percent on disappointment with the software company's forecast
  <br>
  <br>
  EBay slumped 8.2 percent as the company's cautious financial outlook added to concerns about its exposure to tariff actions. (AFP)

    'SAR debt still at very manageable level'

<img alt="Christopher Hui says the ratio of government debt to GDP is less than 17 percent. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793524_1_20250227181644.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the SAR's debt is still "at a very manageable level", and that the government has maintained close contact with global credit rating agencies relating to its financial position.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hui's remarks came after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that the government plans to issue about HK$150 billion to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the next five years to support infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In fact, we have long been in close contact with some relevant rating agencies and we have very regular communications, so that we'll ensure they know about the specific [financial] situation of Hong Kong, our bond issuance plans, as well as the reasoning on how we manage our finances," Hui said in a press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're actually maintaining our debts at a very manageable level right now. As you can see, compared with some other economies, the share of our bond issuance to our overall gross domestic product is less than 17 percent. This is actually very manageable level compared with the international level."
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the financial services and treasury chief noted that authorities hope to improve the city's financial markets by conducting reforms of the stock trading and company listing mechanisms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures include the gradual introduction of a new function by the end of the year to enable most stock transactions to settle one business day after the trade date, in what's called the "T+1" settlement cycle.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new settlement cycle will help improve the quality of the city's stock trading, as the current "T+2" settlement cycle is lagging behind other international peers, such as the US, Canada, and Mexico.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a global trend, really, in terms of increasing capital deployment efficiency, and allow capital to be returned to the investors sooner, so that they can utilise it further," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other reform measures include the establishment of a "technology enterprises channel" by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing to help specialist technology and biotechnology companies, especially those listed on the mainland, seek listings in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hui said that the new channel will provide "tailor-made" assistance and guidance for those firms to prepare better before they submit their IPO applications.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), which operates the city's stock exchange, posted its best-ever annual profit, revenue, and income during 2024 - on the back of the rising market turnover and new listings especially during the fourth quarter of last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Upon releasing its annual financial results on Thursday, the bourse operator revealed its net profit for 2024 rose 10 percent year on year to HK$13 billion, from the HK$11.9 billion registered a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was better than market expectations while surpassing the previous record of HK$12.5 billion seen in 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue and other income, meanwhile, rose nine percent year on year to HK$22.3 billion in 2024, while core business revenue also rose by nine percent to HK$20.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a second interim dividend of HK$4.90 per share, 25 percent more compared with last year, while bringing the annual total to HK$9.26 per share, a rise of 10 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also maintained the payout ratio at 90 percent of earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  "HKEX achieved significant progress and delivery in 2024, a year that featured greater connectivity and engagement with international markets, the launch of multi-year infrastructure enhancement programmes, and fresh trading records that underscore the market’s vibrancy and resilience," said Bonnie Chan, director and chief executive of HKEX, in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The improved macro backdrop supported renewed vibrancy and robustness of our markets, which was reflected in the largest IPO in Hong Kong since 2021 as well as an all-time record trading turnover," she noted.

 Gains in Nvidia ahead of earnings helped lift the Nasdaq on Wednesday while the Dow retreated on White House talk of more tariffs, this time on the European Union.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia jumped 3.7 percent ahead of its keenly anticipated earnings report, viewed as a key proxy for the artificial intelligence industry, which has under-performed other sectors so far in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been under pressure in recent days due to lackluster US economic data and worries about Donald Trump's policies. During a cabinet meeting, the US president said he expects 25 percent tariffs on the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.4 percent at 43,433.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 was flat at 5,956, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 percent to 19,075.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is a reflection of how people view the new administration and the uncertainty of its policies," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, General Motors jumped 3.8 percent after unveiling a new US$6 billion share repurchase authorisation and lifting its quarterly divided by three cents a share.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eli Lilly gained 1.5 percent after announcing it will build four additional new manufacturing sites in the United States in a commitment aimed at influencing upcoming Trump administration decisions on trade and other issues.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shares of BP fell 1.7 percent as it announced a major retreat from renewable energy in a pivot back to petroleum investments. (AFP)

<img alt="The vacancy rate for Hong Kong's prime office space reached a historic high of 17 percent in January, according to property consultancy Colliers. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793353_2_20250226195707.jpg&q=50">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government’s move to pause the sale of commercial land in the upcoming fiscal year has drawn mixed views from analysts – some say it will ease a supply glut of office space while others felt it will have limited impact to the market.
 <br>
  <br>
  The vacancy rate of Grade-A offices reached a record 17 percent in January, according to commercial real estate agency Colliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  That translates to 14 million square feet of empty floor space, while another 5.5 million square feet will be rolled out this year and 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathy Lee, head of research and retail consultancy at Colliers, said rental value of prime office space plunged 40 percent over the past three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the government is very wise to stop selling any commercial land, [so as] to let the market to have some time to digest and absorb the existing available stocks," she told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee added the decision to halt the sale of commercial land was not out of the blue, citing the example of the Queensway Plaza redevelopment which was put on ice amid a market downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, warned the current supply glut will take as long as 10 years to be fully absorbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a separate note, the government also extended the $100 concessionary stamp duty to all properties priced at HK$4 million or below, up from HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee from Colliers welcomed the adjustment, saying it will ease the burden for homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The interest rates remain at a high level, so a lot of homebuyers might still find it difficult to meet their mortgage duties. I think this will help boost demand for smaller-sized units," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, JLL Hong Kong chairman Joseph Tsang was less optimistic.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Budget doesn't focus much on the property market. And this measure has no stimulating effect on the housing market but will instead affect government revenue," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the high inventory of residential properties, housing prices are likely to continue falling."

    Paul Chan delivers 2025-26 budget

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  “In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
  <br>
  <br>
  The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

  Elsewhere, Australian consumer prices dipped month-on-month in January, dragged lower by a slowdown in housing costs and a drop in holiday travel, an outcome that should help reassure policymakers that inflation is heading in the right direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the monthly consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.2 percent in January from December, when it rose 0.8 percent. The annual pace held at 2.5 percent, matching market forecasts. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A hospitality expert on Wednesday said Hong Kong Disneylands’s performance is welcome news, after the amusement park reported records in profit and attendance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong Disneyland reported a net profit of more than HK$830 million, and its highest-ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “This is truly good news and it seems that Disney has been performing quite well in maintaining their uniqueness as an attraction among all the international visitors in Hong Kong," the Vocational Training Council’s Dennis Wong told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Wong noted Disney has successfully maintained a strong local and mainland customer core, he said they should keep innovating to attract new visitors.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Certainly, they have to maintain the freshness of their product. That’s not only maintaining the physical rides, but they have to make sure they will continue rolling out a lot of events and campaigns.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The park will be marking its 20th anniversary from June onward, with its managing director saying the celebrations could be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals.

    Wall Street falls amid pessimistic consumer sentiment

<img alt="A report on Tuesday shows confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793174_2_20250226071332.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine on Tuesday after another report said US households are getting more pessimistic about the economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 5,995 – it's fourth straight drop after setting an all-time high last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 percent to 19,026 as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4 percent to 43,621.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell 2.8 percent, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4 percent. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward US$88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in order to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zoom Communications dropped 8.5 percent even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  They helped offset a 2.8 percent rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia, which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips.

  Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the most expensive chips.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's exports growth slowed significantly last month, while imports picked up, according to official figures.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the value of the city's total exports of goods rose just 0.1 percent year-on-year to HK$389.1 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  That compares with a 5.1 percent annual rise in December and 2.1 percent increase in November, and was the slowest pace of growth in almost a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The value of total imports, however, rose 0.5 percent year-on-year last month to stand at HK$387.1 billion, following a 1.1 percent contraction in December and growth of 5.7 percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson partly attributed January's moderate growth to the timing of Lunar New Year, and said it is more appropriate to analyse the trade data for the January-February period combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, while uncertainties in the external environment, in particular escalating trade protectionism, would continue to weigh on Hong Kong's export performance, steady global economic growth, together with the Central Government's various measures to boost the mainland economy, would provide support," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.6 percent at the open on Tuesday, at 22,716 points.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as world markets are at a delicate juncture, as rising global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty cloud the investment landscape.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, South Korean shares fell on Tuesday, as the country's central bank lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of Korea (BOK) lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, cutting rates for a third time in the current easing cycle as growth concerns take centre stage.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BOK downgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 1.5 percent, from 1.9 percent seen in November. It was even weaker than the governor's earlier warning in January that the projection would be lowered to 1.6 percent or 1.7 percent. (Agencies)

    Canada, Mexico tariffs are going forward: Trump

<img alt="US President Donald Trump wants to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as March 4. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793020_1_20250225073658.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a month-long suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  “We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” he said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the US president also stressed more broadly that his intended “reciprocal” tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)

 US stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week .
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dipped 0.5 percent to 5,983 after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7 percent tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow added 0.1 percent to 43.461, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 percent to 19,286.
  <br>
  <br>
  Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1 percent for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Starbucks rose 1.3 percent after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Big US companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief among them is Nvidia, the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. (AP)

    CLP's annual profit increases by 75 percent

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP Holdings on Monday said its annual profit increased by about 75 percent to HK$11.7 billion last year, thanks partly to notable improvements in its business in Australia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The power giant made a profit of around HK$6.6 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has declared a fourth interim dividend payment of HK$1.26 per share, bringing the total dividend last year to HK$3.15, up from HK$3.10 in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's CEO Chiang Tung-keung said one of CLP's goals is to phase out its remaining coal-fired electricity assets and look into opportunities to use different technologies in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We'll start looking at some emerging technologies, including hydrogen, virtual power plants or carbon capture. Those are technologies that we will be interested in," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we want to achieve net zero by 2050, apart from doing renewable energy, we expect these kinds of technologies will take a very important part, in particular towards the latter part of the coming decade, when we are closer to 2050."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chiang added that CLP supports the government in pushing forward innovation and technology development, especially in the Northern Metropolis.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said his company has reserved sufficient power system capacity to meet the demand for electricity for artificial intelligence and supercomputing centres.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant Alibaba said on Monday it will invest more than 380 billion yuan (US$52.4 billion) on artificial intelligence and cloud computing over the next three years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Investors have piled into Chinese technology stocks since the start of the year, with Alibaba – which runs some of the country's biggest online shopping platforms – seeing its shares soar to three-year highs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains have been boosted since the Hangzhou-based firm announced robust sales growth last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba plans to "invest at least 380 billion yuan over the next three years to advance its cloud computing and AI infrastructure", a company statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said its strategy was aimed at "reinforcing (Alibaba's) commitment to long-term technological innovation... (and) underscores the company's focus on AI-driven growth".
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement did not detail how the company would allocate the funds or what specific projects would be supported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It did add that the investment would exceed its total AI and cloud spending over the past decade.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba last week reported an 8 percent bump in revenue for the three months through December, beating estimates to reach 280 billion yuan and triggering a 14 percent surge in its Hong Kong shares on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  CEO Eddie Wu said last week that the quarterly results "demonstrated substantial progress in (Alibaba's) 'user-first, AI-driven' strategies and the re-accelerated growth of our core businesses". (AFP)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has said Wednesday's budget will detail the government's fiscal consolidation strategies, while revealing the colour of choice for his upcoming blueprint.
 <br>
  <br>
  On his official blog, the finance chief said on Sunday the administration would strictly control its spending, increase revenue appropriately, and make use of public resources and market forces to further boost development.
  <br>
  <br>
  He noted the aqua-coloured cover of the budget reflected the unlimited opportunities presented in future developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is infinite vitality in a beautiful lake. Despite the occasional storms, we have firm confidence and positive expectations for the future given the solid backing of the country and the joint efforts of all sectors in Hong Kong," Chan wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also expressed gratitude to those who gave their suggestions during the budget consultation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan will announce his latest budget on February 26, amid an estimated deficit of HK$100 billion for the financial year ending March 31.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday, concluding the week on a sour note as a big drop in Treasury yields underscored worries about an economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said recent data points, including lackluster US retail sales data and a tepid forecast from Walmart, raised questions about the outlook of the US economy as President Donald Trump presses on with tariffs and government job cuts that could boost unemployment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You are starting to see some disappointment in the economic data," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management, who tied Friday's big drop in the 10-year US Treasury note yield to economic worries.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished at 43,428, down 1.7 percent to around 750 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 also dropped 1.7 percent to 6,013, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.2 percent to 19,524.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, an S&P Global reading on US services industry activity fell to a 25-month low, while a University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment tumbled nearly 10 percent from January.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said both are considered "secondary" economic reports, but they corroborate other major data points on employment and retail sales that have also pointed to weakness.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors ever since the election have been very bullish," he said, pointing to "all the uncertainty coming from Trump."
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, only consumer staples finished in positive territory, while technology, industrials, energy and consumer discretionary lost about two percent or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  A particularly big loser was UnitedHealth Group, which dropped 7.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department is investigating allegations the company directed doctors to make patient diagnoses that would trigger higher government payments under the US Medicare Advantage program.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Alibaba soared more than 14 percent on Friday, extending a blistering rally in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, after forecast-topping earnings added to a growing sense of optimism over Chinese tech firms.
 <br>
  <br>
  The e-commerce titan announced on Thursday that sales rose eight percent to 280 billion yuan in the three months through December, exceeding the 277 billion yuan estimated by a Bloomberg pool of analysts.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent its share prices rocketing 14.6 percent in Hong Kong, building on a rally that has seen it bounce nearly 70 percent higher since the turn of the year, and is now at a three-year high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index finished up 3.99 percent, or 900.94 points, to 23,477.92.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng tech index surged more than six percent, with other household names making big moves higher. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang has emphasised boosting consumption and improving people's livelihoods through stronger and more targeted measures, in a bid to strengthen the fundamental role of consumption in driving economic development.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a session held by the State Council, CCTV cited Li saying that, "Boosting consumption is not only an important way to expand domestic demand and stabilise growth, but also a major measure to transform the development model in the mid-to-long term."
  <br>
  <br>
  More efforts should be made to facilitate service consumption, improve the supply of education, medical care, culture, sports, tourism, elderly care and household services, and accelerate the application of artificial intelligence to unlock consumption potential of AI terminal products, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also emphasised the need to relax market access in relevant industries, and boost high-quality product supply to meet emerging consumer demands.
  <br>
  <br>
  Top policymakers have pledged to try to bolster household incomes and consumption this year. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks dropped on Thursday following disappointing results from Walmart as banking shares fell in a move analysts attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  Walmart reported quarterly results that met expectations, but shares slid 6.5 percent after its forecast missed expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, shares of Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase fell three percent or more, dragging on major indices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which finished at a record the last two days, dropped 0.4 percent to 6,117.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.0 percent to 44,176, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.5 percent to 19,962.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop in banking shares hit stocks that were "very overbought," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments, who noted that major US indices finished above their session lows in spite of significant geopolitical uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whenever there's been trouble in the market, buyers have showed up," said Sarhan, who views the dynamic as an indication of underlying bullishness.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing slumped 2.8 percent after President Donald Trump said he was looking at "alternatives" to the company's Air Force One operation because of delivery delays.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hasbro surged 13 percent after reporting better than expected profits. The toymaker expects 2025 revenues to be "up slightly," it said. (AFP)

    Slight uptick in HK bad loans seen in 2024: BEA

<img alt="The Bank of East Asia delivered a 12 percent increase in its net profits in 2024, to HK$4.6 billion. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1792489_1_20250220180623.jpg&q=45">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of East Asia (BEA) on Thursday said it has been closely monitoring risks related to its exposure to the Hong Kong property sector as there was a slight uptick in so-called "bad loans" last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press conference reviewing the bank's annual financial results, co-chief executive Adrian Li said about 6 percent of BEA's HK$61.4 billion Hong Kong property loans were non-performing in 2024, up from about 3 percent the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Much of these loans were in the commercial real estate sector, he said, adding that credit ratings for some of the bank's local clients were downgraded which in turn prompted the bank to significantly increase provision for its local property loans to over HK$1.2 billion, up from HK$380 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The proportion of local property loans to the group's total loans, meanwhile, dropped to 11.5 percent at the end of last year, from 13.7 percent at the end of 2023, as the bank gradually reduced its exposure to Hong Kong property due to "relatively high risks" on the commercial side.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Li struck a more optimistic tone when it comes to the mainland, saying the risk of bad loans there is stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unwinding of the interest rate cycle should ease pressure on the Chinese real estate sector in the medium term, provided that rates continue their downward trajectory. With the impact of stimulus packages beginning to manifest, confidence is gradually returning improving investors, sentiment and activities," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li's remarks came as the bank delivered a 12 percent increase in its overall net profits in the past financial year, rising to HK$4.6 billion from the HK$4.2 billion in 2023 on the back of US interest rate reductions as well as stimulus measures from Beijing and the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank declared a second interim dividend of HK$0.38 per share, more than double that of the year before, bringing the total annual dividend to HK$0.69 per share, up over 27 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Brian Li, the bank's co-chief executive, said the lender has seen a significant increase in demand from mainland customers for wealth management services in the SAR, with the number of mainland clients jumping 60 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That, he said, helped boost revenue from relevant investment products by 28 percent year-on-year.
