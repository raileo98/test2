<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Thursday, as a Fed-related rally lost steam, and traders looked ahead to the prospect of additional tariffs next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 0.1 percent at 41,953.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,662, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to close at 17,691.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started off in the red, went solidly into the green, only to go back into the red, then back into the green and now we're kind of flatlining," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP, shortly before markets slipped further into the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think investors are basically going to be treading water until April 2," he added, referring to the date at which US President Donald Trump has said he plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, professional firm Accenture's shares slumped 6.7 percent after announcing that the Trump administration's efficiency drive had begun affecting its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The business consulting firm said the cost-cutting drive, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, had hit its federal services business. (AFP)

    White House promises 'big tariffs' on April 2

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt says America "has been ripped off by every country around the world." Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796689_1_20250321011627.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

    Inflation pace eases in February

<img alt="City's inflation eased last month, with prices for clothing and footwear products dropping by about two percent year on year. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796632_1_20250320173703.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation pace eased last month, rising by just 1.4 percent year on year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 1.4 percent is notably lower compared with the two percent annual increase seen in January, according to official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday also showed that the underlying inflation rate, or the rate excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, rose 1.1 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is also lower compared with the 1.6 percent increase seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the slower pace of inflation was mainly due to the timing of last year's Lunar New Year festival, which fell in February, creasing a high base for comparison for this year, especially in regards to food prices and the costs of package tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  By categories, the biggest price spikes were seen in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, with the inflation gauge for this segment rising 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's followed by the price increase for gas and water, as the inflation rate for the category rose 13.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Products that saw price declines were clothing and footwear, basic food, and durable goods, with their rates dropping between one and two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the city's overall inflation will remain moderate in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs pressures might increase somewhat as the economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain broadly in check, though uncertainties stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts continue to warrant attention," the spokesperson said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CK Hutchison has reported a 27 percent drop in net profit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Full-year earnings reached HK$17 billion in 2024, down from HK$23.5 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole, the Group's underlying operating results were relatively stable" last year despite a one-time issue related to its Vietnam telecommunications business, chairman Victor Li said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for 2025, Li said the operating environment for the group's businesses is expected to be "volatile and unpredictable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company announced a final dividend of HK$1.514 per share, compared with HK$1.775 the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conglomerate recently proposed selling its ports business, including assets near the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew criticism from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison did not hold a post-earnings press conference on Thursday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

 Stocks mostly rose on Thursday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell suggested any increase in consumer prices caused by tariffs would likely be short-lived, even as the central bank slashed its growth outlook and hiked inflation expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's de facto central bank has cautioned that local borrowing costs will remain at a relatively high level for some time as it kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve, which also left its target rate steady overnight in a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US rate policy decision, the HKMA said the move by the Fed was in line with market expectations and that the latest released "dot plot," a data chart providing a snapshot of the Fed's thinking, suggests that the Fed might reduce target rates by a total of 50 basis points by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it cautioned that the pace of US interest rate cuts remain quite uncertain due to recent changes in economic indicators and volatility in market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty," it said in a statement, adding that future rate cuts depend on factors such as US inflation and labour market data, as well as fiscal and trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, it noted that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner with the liquidity condition remaining stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA added that it will continue to closely monitor market developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's major commercial banks have also followed suit, with HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) keeping their rates at 5.25 percent and Standard Chartered maintaining its rate at 5.5 percent.

    Trump urges Fed to cut rates as tariffs take effect

<img alt='Donald Trump says "the Fed would be much better off cutting rates". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796555_1_20250320110749.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump urged the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut interest rates to help offset effects of his tariffs, renewing his vocal disagreement with the central bank's decision-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Do the right thing," Trump demanded in a Wednesday night post on his Truth Social site, hours after the Fed decided to hold rates steady, while reducing its growth forecast and hiking its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve has pencilled in two rate cuts this year, but chairman Jerome Powell noted that "uncertainty today is unusually elevated" and that inflation is ticking up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that the tariffs – which are being met with trade retaliation by some countries – threaten to possibly tip the US economy and others into recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has admitted that the economy may suffer "a little disturbance" as his planned levies take hold, but that America is otherwise on the cusp of a "golden age".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's message, he again stressed that April 2, when he plans to enact "reciprocal tariffs" designed to reset global trade, would be a "liberation day" for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he wants US interest rates to come down as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," he posted.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed disagreement with the Fed's rate decisions, urging them to be lowered to boost the economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but pointed to increased economic uncertainty, while Treasury bond yields tumbled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fed's interest rate decision was expected, but the central bank cut its growth forecast for 2025 and hiked its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has nonetheless still penciled in two rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But yields on the 10-year US Treasury note, a closely-watched proxy of monetary policy, fell sharply as the Fed also slowed the pace at which it will shrink the size of its balance sheet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,964.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 5,675, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to 17,750.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Uncertainty today is unusually elevated," Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision was published, adding that at least part of a recent inflation uptick was related to the White House tariff policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Powell also communicated some confidence about the US economic outlook, noting key indicators that have stayed solid in spite of surveys showing weakening consumer confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the market liked hearing the Fed Chair sound reasonably upbeat about the economy," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who noted that the drop in Treasury yields boosts expectations that mortgage rates also will fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing jumped 6.8 percent as CFO Brian West told a Wall Street conference the company's efforts to improve plane assembly operations were on track so far in the first quarter and struck an upbeat tone on the company's outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Mills fell 2.1 percent after reporting a five percent drop in sales as it pointed to a slowdown in demand for snacking and a drop in orders from retailers managing inventories. (AFP)

<img alt="Tencent posts strong fourth quarter financial performances, bolstered by its gaming and advertising businesses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796452_1_20250319182448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Tencent on Wednesday reported a stronger than expected fourth-quarter growth, boosted by a surge in gaming and advertising revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which is the largest video game company in the world, and also the operator of WeChat, saw its revenue grow by 11 percent year on year to 172.4 billion yuan (US$23.83 billion) for the quarter ending in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was much higher compared with the 168.9 billion yuan expected by the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit, meanwhile, was up 90 percent year on year to 51.3 billion yuan during the three month period, also higher than the expected 46.03 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The growth came as its gaming business regained momentum and showed robust recovery since mid-2024, with its domestic gaming revenue rising by 23 percent year on year to 33.2 billion yuan and its global gaming revenue climbing 15 percent to 16 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said the increases were due to a low base from the previous year, as well as growth in some of its hit games including "Honour of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite".
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful launches of its new games such as "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" and "Delta Force" as well as regulatory easing over the nation's gaming sector also helped bolster its growth, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the full year of 2024, the Shenzhen-headquartered firm registered a profit growth of 68 percent year on year to 194 billion yuan, while revenue grew by eight percent year on year to 660 billion yuan, meeting market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also attributed artificial intelligence technology as a driving force to improve its various products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Starting a few months ago, we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products,” Tencent said in its earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe these stepped-up investments will generate ongoing returns via uplifting productivity in our advertising business and longevity of our games, as well as longer term value from accelerated consumer usage of our AI applications and enterprise adoption of our AI services," the firm added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company proposed a final dividend of HK$4.5 per share for the year, marking a 32 percent rise from a year earlier.

    Trump to unveil reciprocal tariffs on April 2

<img alt="US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said if countries stop their practices, the US would not put up the tariff wall. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796362_1_20250319092836.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their downward slide on Tuesday as worries over the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts added to unease over President Trump's aggressive trade agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to yield a ceasefire, prompting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pledge continued fighting in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel resumed bombing Gaza in the deadliest attack since a ceasefire came into effect on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices spent the entire session in the red on the first day of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.

  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 41,581.31.

  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.1 percent to 5,614.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.7 percent to 17,504.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had risen the last two days in a partial rebound from declines in recent weeks as mixed economic data and uncertainty about the Trump administration's trade policies spark talk of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The news of what's going on politically, it's still very uncertain," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "I don't think there's any new news so far this week that should make the market feel more encouraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides uncertainty over the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Cahill also pointed to unease over an April 2 deadline when the Trump administration is expected to announce a fresh litany of tariffs.
  <br>

  Among individual companies, Nvidia fell 3.2 percent as chief executive Jensen Huang showcased cutting-edge chips for artificial intelligence at the company's annual developers conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google parent Alphabet fell 2.4 percent after the tech giant announced it will acquire cloud security platform Wiz for US$32 billion, as it seeks to beef up its cloud computing business for the AI era.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday jailed the former boss of state-owned banking giant Everbright Group for bribery, state media said, the latest official to fall foul of President Xi Jinping's decade-long corruption crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced the investigation into Li Xiaopeng, the company's former Communist Party secretary and chairman, two years ago and brought him to trial in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV reported that a court in northeastern Heilongjiang found Li guilty of accepting bribes worth over 60 million yuan between 1994 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined six million yuan, CCTV said, adding that he received a lighter punishment for confessing his crimes and cooperating with authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The property and interest obtained through his bribes have been recovered... and turned over to the state treasury," CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, former Everbright chairman Tang Shuangning was jailed for 12 years for embezzlement and bribery. (AFP)

 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.

  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for the second straight day on Monday following better US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve decision later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales for February showed a 0.2 percent increase from the previous month, less than the 0.7 percent expected by analysts, but a step above January's 1.2 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data was good enough to keep alive the market's momentum from Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've priced in a lot of the concerns on the trade war," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,841.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,675.12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 17,808.66.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks have been in retreat in recent weeks as President Donald Trump has announced myriad trade actions, implementing some tariffs and delaying other levies in a process that has left markets guessing and generated talk of a possible recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be pressed on whether uncertainty over tariffs has dimmed the US economic outlook at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development trimmed its growth forecast for the United States, citing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, PepsiCo rose 1.8 percent after announcing it will acquire the low-sugar soda brand Poppi for about US$1.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel jumped 6.8 percent on optimism about the chip company's prospects after it last week named tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in China accelerated slightly in the first two months of the year, government data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) offered some positive signs, showing retail sales – a key measure of consumer sentiment – increased four percent year-on-year during January and February combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS said total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan for the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales climbed by 3.7 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, in the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, the statement warned "domestic effective demand is weak, [and] some enterprises face difficulties in production and operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production in January and February increased 5.9 percent year-on-year, data showed, slowing from the 6.2 percent growth in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics authorities combine many economic indicators for the first two months of the year to account for potential distortions caused by the annual Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the surveyed urban unemployment rate – China's main metric for measuring unemployment – in February ticked up to 5.4 percent, the NBS said, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing announced earlier this month that it is targeting GDP growth of five percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with an intensified trade war under US President Donald Trump, the nation’s officials are looking to boost domestic consumption to reduce reliance on exports.  (AFP/Xinhua)

    'Action plan to stabilise stock, property markets'

<img alt="Central authorities have said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796002_1_20250317095840.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland officials on Monday said a special action plan to boost consumption,will, for the first time, put an emphasis on the need to stabilise both the stock and property markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Xinhua News Agency said that the action plan – organised into eight sections – aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions and to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The plan puts an emphasis on stabilising the stock and property markets, and proposes corresponding measures in a bid to make people feel more confident about consuming, with more stable expectations,” a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, Li Chunlin, told reporters at a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said officials have sought to strengthen demand-side policies to stimulate consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, the plan proposes to promote the reasonable growth of wages. This includes supporting enterprises to stabilise employment, and supporting workers to improve their skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We want to] scientifically and reasonably raise the minimum wage, so that the minimum wage standard can be adjusted on time and in a steady manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said, adding there are proposals to linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pointed out that the central government has doubled to 300 billion yuan the "ultra-long bonds" earmarked for subsidising the public's replacement of goods such as mobile electronic devices, electric cars and electronic home appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's plan also includes proposals to formulate a childcare subsidy scheme, implement paid annual leave for workers, boost healthcare protection for the elderly, along with other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, official data showed on Monday that new home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February. On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a five percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the central government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. China will also introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth.

    CK Hutchison ports deal questioned again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, while the Dow index was mostly up. (AFP)

 Safe-haven gold surpassed US$3,000 for the first time on Friday, boosted by uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while stock markets gained on hopes US lawmakers will avert a government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Markets hate uncertainty, and Trump's second tenure in the White House has served to provide huge instability over expectations for trade, jobs, inflation, and government spending," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Asian equities managed to end the week on a positive note while European markets were also up in midday deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks gained support from "hopes that the US government would avoid a shutdown of non-essential services," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just hours until a deadline to push a Republican spending bill through, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package would keep the lights on through September, but Democrats have come under pressure from their grassroots to defy the plan, which they say is full of harmful spending cuts. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison shares down after port deal criticism

<img alt="CK Hutchison earlier agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by BlackRock. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795749_1_20250314172048.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

    US stocks slump after new Trump tariff threat

<img alt="Before trading began, Washington unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795654_1_20250314054827.jpg&q=90">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday on a fresh wave of tariff threats by US President Donald Trump, and despite producer inflation remaining flat.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 percent to 40,813, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.4 percent to 5,521.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost nearly two percent to 17,303.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P drop means the index has tumbled into a correction, or down 10 percent from its highest point of the year, recorded just last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before trading began, Trump unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  His threat came after the EU announced a series of countermeasures against new US steel and aluminum tariffs, including a sharp hike targeting US whiskey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would make good on his threat if the bloc's planned whiskey levy "is not removed immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, government data also showed that the producer price index was flat in February, after a 0.6 percent rise in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's pretty good news in terms of inflation but the problem is, you have a trade war that's expanding," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  While recent inflation reports have been encouraging, Cardillo added that markets are wary as the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, alongside Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on the economy. (AFP)

<img alt="Tan Lip Bu rejoins Intel as chief executive on Tuesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795538_1_20250313134923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Tan Lip Bu as the latest in a succession of chief executives to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job on Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous head, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.
  <br>
  <br>
  This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down in August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lip Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” interim executive chairman Frank Yeary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60 percent, wiping out US$160 billion in shareholder wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees — about 15 percent of its workforce — and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of US$19 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvida now boasts a market value of US$2.8 trillion compared to Intel's US$90 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel's stock price rose more than 10 percent in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

<img alt="The shifts came after the consumer price index came in at a cooler than expected 2.8 percent for February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795496_1_20250313063349.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained some ground Wednesday helped by a rise in tech shares, as easing inflation assuaged some investor jitters about the world's biggest economy even as tariff worries lingered.
 <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index gained 0.5 percent to 5,599.30 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index surged 1.2 percent to 17,648.45.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 percent to 41,350.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shifts came after the consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, came in cooler than expected for February, the first full month that President Donald Trump was in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI was up 2.8 percent from a year ago, a touch lower than the 3.0 percent increase in January, according to Labor Department data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, "core" CPI was up 3.1 percent, also easing from before.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Karl Haeling of LBBW cautioned that the market rebound might have more to do with its "technical condition."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tech stocks got hit the most, so they're the ones that are bouncing the most," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US markets slumped early this week on fears that Trump's tariff policies might nudge the country's economy into a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But tech stocks picked up Wednesday with Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla logging notable gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the health of the US economy, subsequent data reports will likely be more meaningful when it comes to reflecting the effects of tariffs, Haeling added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's sweeping levies on steel and aluminium imports kicked in, marking the latest salvo in his broadening series of duties. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported marginal full-year profit growth as airfares fell amid intense competition at a time when Asia's airlines are continuing to get back to pre-pandemic seat capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city’s flagship airline posted a one percent rise in its group net profit of HK$9.89 billion for the year ended December 31, supported by elevated cargo demand, more passengers, lower fuel prices and cost efficiencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the Hong Kong-listed airline jumped almost four percent to their highest since May 2019 just after the results were announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay Pacific's full-service airline, however, saw its annual yield, a proxy for airfares, fall 12 percent, while yields at the group's fully owned low-cost carrier HK Express fell 23 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Express reported a full-year loss of HK$400 million compared to a profit of HK$433 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay attributed the drops at HK Express to intense competition on regional routes pushing airfares down and industry-wide issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power its Airbus A320neo planes, which grounded some aircraft in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A path to sustained profitability can be expected as [HK Express] continues to grow and increase its efficiencies," Cathay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline's cargo yields, meanwhile, rose three percent year on year and the airline carried 11 percent more cargo tonnage, although Cathay warned that developing global trade conflicts could pose challenges to its freight business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the global geopolitical situation, we are cautiously monitoring any short-term impacts on air cargo demand," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer,  Lavinia Lau, noted that shifts in global trade policies, such as de minimis changes, have increased uncertainties over the cargo market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that the airline has contingency plans to handle unexpected changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always built in flexibility in our business, meaning that if we see demand from a certain country or region having changes, we can always shift our network and flights to other parts of the world," she said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

    Australia says US steel tariffs 'entirely unjustified'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington's looming tariffs on steel and aluminium are "entirely unjustified", Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday after failing to secure a last-minute exemption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a friendly act," Albanese told reporters, after the White House dashed hopes that Australia would be excluded from blanket 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite clearly it is not a positive step in our relationship. It is as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's decision to slug close ally Australia was "entirely unjustified", Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the setback, Albanese said Australia would not retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese hinted that Australia may be one of the few nations to secure an exemption following a phone call with Trump in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials told Australian media overnight that the exemption was no longer on the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He considered it, and considered against it," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told national broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is a minor global player in steel export markets but is a dominant source of iron ore, a key raw ingredient in the alloy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian steel producer BlueScope said it employed around 4,000 staff in the United States. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday on uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff threats, just one day after taking a dramatic plunge on the back of recession fears.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump reported late in the afternoon that he would "probably" reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, just hours after announcing a sharp hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days of back-and-forth on tariff hikes against some of the United States' closest trading partners have worn heavily on markets, while Trump's weekend refusal to rule out the possibility of a recession sent Wall Street tumbling Monday, with the Nasdaq marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks," Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management told AFP, adding that it's "largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference today is, for the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news, it appears as though there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.1 percent, bringing it to 41,433.48.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slid 0.8 percent to 5,572.07, while the tech-rich Nasdaq composite Index retreated 0.2 percent to 17,436.10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios," Hogan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite its small drop, the tech-centric Nasdaq was bolstered by megacaps such as Tesla and Nvidia, which began to claw their way back following drastic plunges on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The electric car maker bounced 3.8 percent after Trump announced he was buying one of its vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  And AI chipmaker Nvidia was in positive territory Tuesday, climbing 1.7 percent after tumbling one day prior. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's economy expanded in the October-December quarter at a slower pace than initially reported, government data showed on Tuesday, weighed by weaker consumption but still likely supporting the case for further interest rate hikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gross domestic product expanded an annualised 2.2 percent in the three months to December, the Cabinet Office's revised data showed, slower than the 2.8 percent growth in the initial estimate and economists' median forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised numbers translate into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.6 percent in price-adjusted terms, compared with a 0.7 percent growth issued on February 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of Japan raised short-term interest rates in January to their highest in 17 years, and growth momentum in the world's fourth-largest economy will be among key factors determining how fast it continues to tighten policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital expenditure component of GDP, a barometer of private demand-led strength, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, revised up from a 0.5 percent expansion in the initial estimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of economic activity, was unchanged versus the preliminary reading of 0.1 percent uptick.
  <br>
  <br>
  External demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.7 of a percentage point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary reading. Domestic demand shaved 0.2 of a percentage point off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate data from the internal affairs ministry showed household spending rose 0.8 percent in January year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending dropped 4.5 percent, bigger than an estimated 1.9 percent decline. (Reuters)

    Wall Street sells off on US recession fears

<img alt="The main three US indices fell between 2 percent and 4 percent. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795182_1_20250311061228.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors fretted that uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The moves came after Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a 2025 recession, saying there would be "a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big -- we're bringing wealth back to America."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks led the slump, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq plunged by 4.0 percent, bringing it to 17,468.32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index retreated 2.7 percent to 5,614.56 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.1 percent to 41,911.71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tech names saw sharp losses, with Tesla shares diving 15.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks -- which include Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia -- also sank.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets were previously bolstered by hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that sentiment has been bogged down by more immediate worries over tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new wave of tariffs threatens to hit this week, with steep levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminum due to take effect Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ongoing confusion about tariffs and concerns that maybe the Doge cuts are excessive led to a drop in consumer sentiment, and are now leading to fears of a slowdown or higher inflation or both," Sosnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to sweeping cuts to the federal government overseen by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). (AFP)

  <br>
  In a Fox News interview on Sunday, US President Donald Trump declined to predict whether his tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico would result in a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures sank and the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc strengthened early on Monday as deflationary pressures in China added to growth worries.

  On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was basically flat at the opening, rising 0.02 percent to 3,373.26 points. The Shenzhen Component Index also opened slightly higher, rising 0.18 percent to10,862.93 points. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

    7-Eleven explores sell-offs with Couche-Tard

<img alt="Seven & i operates some 85,000 convenience stores worldwide. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795045_1_20250310090227.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese owner of 7-Eleven said on Monday it had agreed to jointly explore store sell-offs with Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT) to address antitrust concerns ahead of a potential merger.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes just days after Seven & i - which has wholly-owned 7-Eleven, the world's biggest convenience store brand, since 2005 - announced a raft of new measures to fend off a takeover from its Canadian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joint outreach by financial advisors to ACT and 7&i to potential buyers has begun," Seven & i said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Couche-Tard has agreed to jointly "map out the viability of a divestiture process by defining operational, management, and financial characteristics of the group of stores to be sold and identifying potential buyers", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying US antitrust regulators," Seven & i said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We and our advisors believe we can now make progress towards determining whether a credible and actionable remedy and divestiture package can be achieved that would allow a realistic assessment of ACT's proposal."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the Tokyo-based company announced a huge share buyback and an IPO of its US unit - the latest twist in a saga that began last year, when Seven & i rebuffed a takeover offer worth nearly US$40 billion from ACT.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Seven & i rejected the initial takeover offer from ACT in September, the company said it had "grossly" undervalued its business and could face regulatory hurdles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such a takeover would be the biggest foreign buyout of a Japanese firm, merging the 7-Eleven, Circle K and other franchises to create a global convenience store behemoth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven & i, which operates some 85,000 convenience stores worldwide, also named Stephen Dacus as its first foreign CEO on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACT, which began with one store in Quebec in 1980, runs nearly 17,000 convenience store outlets worldwide, including Circle K. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the United States might enter a recession this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to predict things like that," he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big - we're bringing wealth back to America," he said, adding, "It takes a little time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more definitive when asked on Sunday about the possibility of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Absolutely not," he told NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked whether Americans should brace for a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and others have left the US financial markets in turmoil and consumers unsure what the year might bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets just ended their worst week since the November election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures of consumer confidence are down, as shoppers - already battered by years of inflation - brace for the higher prices that tariffs can bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  And widespread government lay-offs being engineered by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk add further concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked later on Sunday to clarify his remarks on whether there could be a recession, Trump told reports on Air Force One "Who knows?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the signs are mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A widely-watched Atlanta Federal Reserve index now predicts a 2.4 percent contraction of real GDP growth in the year's first quarter, which would be the worst result since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists at Goldman Sachs, citing Trump's policies, have raised their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Morgan Stanley predicted "softer growth this year" than earlier expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of weak or negative GDP growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US was briefly in recession in early 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread. Millions of people lost jobs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation in February fell at the quickest pace since January 2024, while producer price deflation persisted, as seasonal demand faded while households are still cautious about spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index edged down 0.7 percent last month from a year earlier, reversing January's 0.5 percent increase, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first contraction in the index since January 2024, and worse than a 0.5 percent slide estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.2 percent month-on-month, against a 0.7 percent rise in January and below a predicted 0.1 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index fell 2.2 percent on year in February, improving from a 2.3 percent slide in January, but missing the forecast 2.1 percent decline. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday after a roller-coaster session following mixed labor market data, concluding a losing week on a positive note.
 <br>
  <br>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said investors were reassured by a midday appearance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who described the central bank is in no hurry to shift course on monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When Powell came out with a calm and reassuring tone, it gave the market an excuse to rally," O'Hare said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,770, up 0.6 percent for the day but down 3.1 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 percent at 42,801, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7 percent to 18,196.
  <br>
  <br>
  US jobs data for February showed the country's economy added 151,000 jobs last month, up from January's revised 125,000 figure, but fewer than analysts estimates as unemployment ticked higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts described the report as unspectacular but good enough to suggest the labor market is not weakening precipitously.
  <br>
  <br>
  But O'Hare said investors are readjusting their views of the coming period in light of other disappointing economic reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is rethinking its growth outlook," he said. "Some of that is the tariffs. Some of that is the work around 'Doge'. Some of it is in the data itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Costco slumped 6.1 percent following disappointing earnings that sparked unease about the wholesaler's exposure to tariffs. Walmart also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Broadcom surged 8.6 percent after strong results boosted enthusiasm about the company's work in artificial intelligence. (AFP)

 China's export growth grew slower than expected in the first two months of this year while imports fell sharply, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to customs data released on Friday, outbound shipments from China in January and February rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a gain of 10.7 percent in December and market expectations of a 5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slower pace was attributed partly to firms rushing out exports before the anticipated US tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports declined 8.4 percent year on year, after rising by 1 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the drop in imports of grain, iron ore and crude oil signalled that Beijing was scaling back on purchases of key commodities amid heightened tensions with the United States under  the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus for the two months came in at US$170 billion. (Agencies)

    Golden era for low-altitude economy: CPPCC delegates

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has ushered in a golden era to develop the so-called "low altitude" economy, or even a "sky city", according to delegates at the country's top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as the annual "Two Sessions" continues in Beijing, featuring delegates at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Yang Yi, a CPPCC delegate, who is also a senior technical expert at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, said the low-altitude economy is one example of "new quality productive forces", as it has vast potential to open up a new industry while reshaping the current sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has ushered in the golden period of developing the low-altitude economy, it is now the industry's 'take-off' period, and the low-altitude economy will become a new engine of China's economic growth, to spark new consumption trends," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The idea of building a city in the sky will no longer be simply a dream," she added, noting this year's key tasks include gradually opening up the nation's aerial space, enhancing regulatory frameworks and safety, continuing technological innovation, while encouraging market engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xu Xiaolan, a vice chairperson of the standing committee of the CPPCC National Committee, who is also the vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, said the country's internet-based industrial production had expanded to cover 49 economic fields, involving some 1.53 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, a computer scientist, who is also the former vice minister of the Industry and Information Technology of China, added the latest breakthroughs achieved by DeepSeek have also been applied to various sectors including the search engines, text generating, medicine, culture, and tourism.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their retreat on Thursday, falling hard ahead of key US jobs data as markets shrugged off President Trump's latest moves to soften tariff actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, but the shift was not enough to spark a change in stock market activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down one percent at 42.579, after spending the entire session in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent to 5,738, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.6 percent to 18,069.
  <br>
  <br>
  Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management said the uncertainty around trade policy is "affecting the real economy," dragging down consumer sentiment and business investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The longer that goes on, the more the economy slows," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again to boost the struggling eurozone, but suggested the easing could be nearing an end and warned of "rising uncertainty" amid massive German spending plans and US tariff threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large tech firms were among the bigger losers Thursday, including Netflix, down 8.5 percent, Tesla, down 5.6 percent and Nvidia, down 5.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report for February. Weekly jobless claims figures released on Thursday were better than expected, while Wednesday's private payroll report from ADP lagged estimates. (AFP)

<img alt="Only 4.5 percent of private flats were vacant as of end-2024, the government says. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794626_1_20250306222204.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to an S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

    Thanks to property gains, MTR profit more than doubles

<img alt="The MTR Corporation posts a net profit of HK$15.77 billion for 2024. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794580_1_20250306173403.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)
