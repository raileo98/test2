<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained stable in the final three months of last year at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the previous figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate was also unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total employment increased by about 7,100 to 3,718,900, while the labour force barely changed at 3,831,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of unemployed people fell by around 6,100 to 113,600, while the number of underemployed individuals dropped by about 1,800 to 43,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the overall jobless rate remained low and there were improvements in the manufacturing, financing, social work, arts, entertainment and recreation sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though the employment situation in some sectors might be more affected by the increased uncertainties in the global environment," he added.

    Bitcoin reaches new record on Trump comeback

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high, trading above US$109,000 on Monday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788326_1_20250120170729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin hit a record high above US$109,000 on Monday as Donald Trump, who has signalled plans to deregulate the cryptocurrency sector, prepares to be sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin surged to reach an all-time peak of US$109,241 ahead of Trump's inauguration ceremony, before falling back to US$107,765.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared since Trump won the presidential election in November, with bitcoin surpassing US$100,000 for the first time in early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after he nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the new president will deregulate the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having once branded cryptocurrencies a "scam", Trump changed his stance and was a major advocate of them during his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, he launched his own cryptocurrency, appropriately called $TRUMP, sparking feverish buying that sent its market capitalisation soaring to several billion dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  When bitcoin reached the landmark US$100,000 level, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! US$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was pitched as a way to break free of mainstream financial institutions by establishing a decentralised platform for transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency is created -- or "mined" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on a meddle-proof register known as the blockchain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has long been criticised for being the currency of choice for making untraceable payments on the so-called dark web, a hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The asset has often come under attack for facilitating money laundering and allowing extortion through ransomware attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its carbon footprint has also come under scrutiny because mining cryptocurrencies requires huge amounts of energy. (AFP)

    Country Garden on track to agree terms with creditors

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property giant Country Garden, which previously defaulted on its debt repayment obligations, expects to reach agreeable terms with creditors next month, the firm's lawyer told a Hong Kong court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Kingboard Holdings, filed a petition against Country Garden in February last year for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. (Reuters)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stock indexes closed their best week in two months with a flourish on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 59.32 points, or one percent, to 5,996.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 334.70, or 0.8 percent, to 43,487.83, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 291.91 points, or 1.5 percent, to 19,630.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were driven by big tech stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the companies in the so-called Magnificent Seven rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks were helped this week by an encouraging report on US inflation , which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more interest rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the latest inflation data, some experts are still bearish about the prospects for more cuts. With the US economy in solid overall shape, "you shouldn't fix what's not broken," Bank of America economists Claudio Irigoyen and Antonio Gabriel said in a BofA Global Research report.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also pointed to the uncertainties created by "Trumponomics 2.0," amid fears that the new administration's policies could help push up inflation. (AP)

    IMF raises global growth outlook

<img alt="The IMF expects global growth to increase slightly this year, although still below pre-pandemic levels. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788065_1_20250117222710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global growth is expected to increase slightly this year while remaining stuck below its pre-pandemic average, the IMF said on Friday, flagging the growing economic divide between the United States and European countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an update to its flagship World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global growth to hit 3.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its previous forecast in October, and to remain at 3.3 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growth is steady," IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding it remained below the average global growth rate in the first two decades of the 21st century of 3.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects the global inflation rate to continue decelerating, reaching 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2026, with prices cooling faster in advanced economies than in emerging markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among advanced economies, the interesting development here is the strength and resilience and growth of the US economy," Gourinchas said, pointing to the IMF's decision to hike its outlook for US growth to 2.7 percent in 2025 and to 2.1 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market has been strong, there is strong demand, private demand is robust, there is good confidence," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects China's growth rate to continue cooling this year to 4.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from the October forecast, before easing to 4.5 percent next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slight upgrade was due to the Chinese government's recently announced package of fiscal support to help prop up the economy, amid an ongoing property market slump and uncertainty about trade policy once Donald Trump takes office next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy is leading to something of a "rebalancing" among emerging markets, Gourinchas said, with countries including India -- which the IMF expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year and next -- playing a more important role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to pick up by less than previously forecast due largely to the effect of oil production cuts by the Opec+ group of oil-producing nations, which includes Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the risks to the IMF's forecasts is policy uncertainty in the United States, where Trump is preparing to return to the White House and has threatened to unleash tariffs on a host of nations including China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the economic picture in America stands in stark contrast to the Euro area, where a sharp downgrade for Germany has dampened expectations for a rebound in growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF now sees Euro area growth to increase slightly to 1.0 percent this year, and 1.4 percent in 2026, below its October forecasts. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

    HK to see more opportunity than challenges in 2025: FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 9,000 bankruptcy applications were made in Hong Kong last year, the highest annual number in almost a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed 9,190 petitions for bankruptcy were recorded, up 17 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since 9,875 applications were made in 2015.

  <br>
  There were 781 applications in December alone, representing a 16 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court last year also rose, standing at 8,553.

  <br>
  The office also received 740 compulsory winding-up petitions, a 30 percent jump over the number in 2023 and the highest figure since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 443 court orders last year for companies to be liquidated.

    China economy expands 5 percent in 2024

<img alt="China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Friday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787956_1_20250117101930.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the nation's growth for 2024, NBS commissioner Kang Yi touched on the challenges at home and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2024 witnessed a complex international environment... and there was a lack of efficient demand, and pains in the shift of growth drivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all that, the Chinese economy withstood pressures, overcame difficulties, making a new contribution to global growth," Kang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), said it was in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the troubled property sector remains a concern, despite slight improvements in new domestic home prices, with those in first-tier cities edging up 0.2 percent last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still too early to conclude if there is a stablisation in the property market. Of course the property prices in both the first-hand and secondary markets seemed to have improved, but they are still contracting, still in the negative region on a monthly basis," he said, adding that transaction volumes still dropped around 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really need to see an overall improvement of the property prices, a sustainable improvement, because the wealth effect determines whether households are willing to spend, and also affects the assessment of the economic prospects in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

    Retail sales figures cast pall over US markets

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower as investors digested the latest US retail figures. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787923_1_20250117063623.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lacklustre."
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December. That was slower than November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high.
  <br>
  <br>
  After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group said there were "threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment," Brooks added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors remain cautious ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2 percent to 43,153.13, the S&P 500 also lost 0.2 percent to 5,937.34, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 percent to 19,338.29.  (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States cooled in December, according to government data released on Thursday, despite receiving a boost from petrol stations and autos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The performance was likely helped by replacement vehicle sales after the devastation of Hurricane Helene in September, analysts said, and consumers buying cars earlier to avoid potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But still, overall, sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, reaching US$729.2 billion, the Department of Commerce said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a slower pace than November's 0.8 percent reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, retail sales were up 3.9 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  For all of 2024, total sales were 3.0 percent higher from 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among sectors, sales at restaurants and bars slid 0.3 percent from November to December, while those at building material and supplies dealers dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at motor vehicle and parts dealers, sales rose 0.7 percent on-month, while those at petrol stations jumped 1.5 percent – likely due to higher petrol prices in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Attempts to get ahead of post-tariff price hikes seem to be lifting measures of underlying retail sales," said economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a recent note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they warned: "Sales (that) pulled forward due to hurricane damage and the threat of tariffs, or a passing boost from the shifting timing of Black Friday, do not provide the foundation for a sustained climb in spending." (AFP)

    'HK a top choice for mainland firms to go global'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong is the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to expand their business overseas, as Tencent-backed digital lender WeBank opened a Hong Kong headquarters for its new tech arm.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inauguration and signing ceremony for WeBank Technology, Chan said the city's financial technology ecosystem has seen positive growth in recent years, with the number of firms in the sector growing 15 percent year-on-year to 1,100 in 2024, including eight digital banks and four digital insurance companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong has the unique advantage to connect the mainland with the world, and is also the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to go overseas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have a full chain of financing and professional services, this could support WeBank Technology to export its advanced tech and explore business expansion in the international market, especially, to provide more inclusive financial services to countries in the Global South to support local social and economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen vice-mayor Luo Huanghao, who also attended the event, said the mainland's tech hub will collaborate with Hong Kong to further promote the application of the digital yuan through more trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank president Li Nanqing said the opening of the new headquarters in Hong Kong can help the company expand along Belt and Road countries and boost economic integration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank gained regulatory approval to set up its fintech subsidiary in Hong Kong last July and plans to invest up to US$150 million and create high-skilled jobs in the SAR.

 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The R&D centre at Hong Kong's Automotive Platforms and Applications Systems (APAS) on Thursday warned electric vehicle (EV) owners to be careful when charging their cars on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre said most EVs in Hong Kong use either Japanese or American charging standards and an adaptor is usually needed to charge them on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such adaptors are hard to find, the centre said, with those that are available coming with a price tag of between several thousand and tens of thousands of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a lack of standardisation regarding safety when it comes to the adaptors, the centre said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive Officer of the centre Du Yonghai said to help solve these problems, they are developing their own adaptor which they plan to make commercially available.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been actively engaging with several partners so that we can commercialise that product, that solution and make it available to the market," Du said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, about 100,000 electronic vehicles were registered in Hong Kong.

<img alt="The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong wants to see more support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787850_1_20250116173416.jpg&q=55">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chipmaking giant TSMC on Thursday announced a better-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter as it benefits from booming demand for AI technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company is the world's largest contract maker of chips that are used in everything from Apple's iPhones to Nvidia's cutting-edge artificial intelligence hardware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said net profit for the three months to December jumped 57 percent on-year to NT$374.7 billion (US$11.4 billion).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was better than the NT$369.8 billion forecast by analysts, and underscores expectations for sustained spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38.8 percent to NT$868.46 billion, TMSC said, beating forecasts. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks jumped on Wednesday, reversing a recent decline as traders responded enthusiastically to strong bank earnings and data indicating a slowdown in underlying inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.7 percent at 43,221, while the broad-based S&P 500 jumped 1.8 percent to 5,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day's largest gains came in the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which surged by 2.5 percent to end the day at 19,511.
  <br>
  <br>
  US financial heavyweights including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported soaring profits Wednesday propelled by strength in trading and financial advisory services.
  <br>
  <br>
  And fresh data showed headline inflation rose in the 12 months to December, but actually eased once volatile food and energy prices were stripped out, fueling optimism in the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of relief from the (inflation) data this morning," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones told AFP, noting there had been a positive reaction in the markets to the decline in the so-called "core" inflation measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on long-dated US Treasurys including the popular two- and 10-year notes dropped sharply as investors piled back into bonds and pushed up prices, which move inversely to yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Tesla's shares soared by 8.0 percent, as did those of Bank of New York Mellon after it reported strong quarterly earnings results. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

    Mixed day for US stocks as market awaits bank earnings

<img alt="The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787570_1_20250115062828.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed after a choppy session as traders digested better-than-expected inflation data and looked ahead to bank earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future," Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds," said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)

    'Cooperation needed to ensure safe AI development'

<img alt="Stuart Russell says Hong Kong can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787519_1_20250114190636.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A British computer scientist on Tuesday urged countries to prioritise cooperation when it comes to the issue of safety in the development of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible," he said. "Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day financial forum hosted some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off a weak opening and another uptick in Treasury bond yields amid shifting monetary policy expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US indices began the day in the same posture as Friday's session, when equities sold off after a strong jobs report was seen as dimming the odds for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices finished the day in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.9 percent at 42,297.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent to 5,836, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 percent to 19,088, well above its session lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  LBBW's Karl Haeling said the market is less overbought compared with a few weeks ago after the sluggish beginning to 2025 equity trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is showing less sensitivity to higher bond yields," Haeling said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7 percent after announcing a deal to acquire Intra-Cellular Therapies for about US$14.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intra-Cellular, which focuses on treatments for depression and schizophrenia, jumped 34.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Moderna sank 16.8 percent as it projected 2025 revenues of between US$1.5 and US$2.5 billion, falling from the 2024 level of around US$3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail shares were mixed following financial updates that included inputs from the critical holiday shopping season. Macy's dropped 8.2 percent and Abercrombie & Fitch slumped 15.6 percent but Lululemon Athletica climbed 0.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes earnings from large banks, as well as economic releases on US inflation and retail sales. (AFP)

    China's economy to surpass US from 2030: economist

<img alt="Justin Lin says the potential US tariff hikes under Trump will hurt the global economy. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787334_2_20250113175438.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A prominent Chinese economist and national political advisor said China is likely to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy in about five years, as he dismissed concerns of a second Trump administration's impact on the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either]," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the short-term economic outlook in the country, the senior economist noted the Chinese economy would be able to grow about five percent this year, and the nation would continue to contribute 30 percent or more to global growth.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Eddie Yue, has welcomed news that the People's Bank of China will unveil various measures to boost financial collaboration between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng made the announcement during a speech on the first day of the Asian Financial Forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  The measures include the linking of Hong Kong's Fast Payment System (FPS) to the mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS).
  <br>
  <br>
  “Residents in the two places can make real-time cross-boundary payments using their phone number,” Yue told reporters after attending the forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect to launch part of the service in the middle of the year, and will expand the scheme slowly and in an orderly manner, based on our actual implementation situation and experience.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures include the launch of a trade finance scheme to help enterprises trading in yuan improve liquidity.
  <br>
  <br>
  There will be 100 billion yuan available in currency swaps for one, three and six months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said the scheme will be rolled out by February.
  <br>
  <br>
  From Tuesday, the clearing time for Southbound Trading under Bond Connect will be pushed back by one hour to 4.30pm, while mainland investors will also be allowed to buy securities of more currency types, including the US dollar and the euro.
  <br>
  <br>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui, for his part, said the various measures show the central bank’s support in consolidating Hong Kong’s role as a financial centre.

<img alt="Chinese exports surged to record highs in 2024 as the prospect of a testing second Trump administration looms. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787274_1_20250113125415.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports surged to a record high in 2024, providing a much-needed boost for the economy as the prospect of biting tariffs imposed by US President-elect Donald Trump looms.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump, set to return to the White House next week, has proposed hefty tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears of a renewed trade war between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total exports in 2024 exceeded 25 trillion yuan for the first time, reaching 25.45 trillion yuan (US$3.47 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 7.1 percent", according to state media.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports rose 2.3 percent to 18.39 trillion yuan, state media said, adding that combined trade swelled five percent to reach a record 43.85 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger," Wang said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Outbound shipments are likely to stay resilient in the near-term, supported by further gains in global market share thanks to a weak real effective exchange rate," she wrote in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But exports will likely weaken later in the year if Trump follows through on his threat to impose tariffs, Huang said. (Xinhua/Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US authorities have extended the deadline for Japan's Nippon Steel to abandon its acquisition of its American rival after President Joe Biden blocked the deal, the companies said Sunday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Biden cited national security concerns as he put a stop to the US$14.9 billion sale of US Steel to the Japanese giant.
  <br>
  <br>
  Accusing the president of "illegal interference", the companies filed a legal review with the US court of appeals.
  <br>
  <br>
  The administration will now hold off enforcing the order until June 18, Nippon Steel and US Steel said, extending an initial 30-day deadline.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are pleased that CFIUS (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) has granted an extension to June 18, 2025 of the requirement in President Biden's Executive Order that the parties permanently abandon the transaction," the companies said in a joint statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We look forward to completing the transaction, which secures the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the outgoing president's decision to block the transaction enjoyed rare bipartisan support at home, it drew sharp criticism from the Japanese government and business community.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's industry minister labelled it "incomprehensible" and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called on Washington to "explain clearly" its rationale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan and the United States are each other's top foreign investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It is important to appropriately deal with the issue while not undermining the big picture of the Japan-US alliance," Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I will ask the US side to remove concerns which are spreading in the business community," he said during a television debate. (AFP)

    2025 full of uncertainties and challenges: HKMA chief

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has predicted that 2025 will be a year marked by uncertainties and many changes, while the SAR will be affected by policies set to be introduced by incoming US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authority chief executive Eddie Yue also admitted on Sunday the city cannot fully shield itself from unforeseen factors in global financial markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When we look at the global monetary policy from a couple years ago, we experienced similar external shocks - our interest rates went up and down together," he told a radio programme.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But now there's division in international monetary policy. The United States may have slower rate cuts, but other places will increase interest rates. It could lead to faster and more volatile global capital flows, with cracks emerging that we didn't see over the past few years."
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking back at the past year, Yue said Hong Kong's overall financial system had developed "quite well". The Hong Kong dollar remained stable, while the linked exchange rate system operated in an orderly manner, he noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's de-facto central banker also said global investors had changed their impression of the SAR over the past year, referring to his observations at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit last November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Whether they were being interviewed on stage or chatting with us on the side, they had full confidence in Hong Kong and saw that we have many opportunities in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No one asked me how the Article 23 [legislation] affected Hong Kong or how the national security law affected Hong Kong. Those were no longer topics of interest. [Investors] were more concerned about the development of the mainland."

    US markets fall after jobs figures feed rate worries

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Friday, after a strong employment report fuelled expectations the central bank might make fewer interest rate cuts this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 percent to 41,938.45, and the S&P 500 Index fell 1.5 percent to 5,827.04.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.6 percent to 19,161.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slide across major indexes came after a Department of Labor report showed the world's biggest economy adding 256,000 jobs in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  This defied expectations of a slowdown in job growth, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 percent as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shot up, before moderating its gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors took the better-than-expected labour market figures "as a sign" that the Federal Reserve would be slower in reducing interest rates, said Sam Stovall of CFRA.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the Fed has started cutting rates last year, after the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers have been balancing this with progress in lowering inflation sustainably.
  <br>
  <br>
  "January will continue to be a volatile month," Stovall said, citing interest rate worries and traders' focus on earnings reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market sees a 97 percent chance that the Fed holds rates steady at its next policy meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Apple shed 2.4 percent and Nvidia shares fell 3.0 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US job gains soared past expectations in December, according to government data released on Friday, in a sign that the labour market remains healthy just shortly before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hiring in the world's biggest economy was 256,000 last month, up from a revised 212,000 in November, said the Labour Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  The jobless rate crept down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest report marks a solid end to 2024 for the jobs market, which has held up in the face of elevated interest rates, allowing consumers to continue spending.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump's return to the White House this month could bring uncertainty.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has pledged to raise tariffs on imports and deport undocumented immigrants – many of whom are a part of the US labour force including in areas like agriculture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, average hourly earnings picked up 0.3 percent from the month before to US$35.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, wages were up 3.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Labour market resilience and continued wage growth support consumption, a key driver of the US economy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sales of electric and hybrid vehicles jumped more than 40 percent in China last year, as demand for new energy models continues to surge and the sector remains entrenched in a gruelling price war.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Chinese electric vehicle market has witnessed explosive growth in recent years, driven in part by subsidies from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the world's largest automotive market has also seen fierce competition among domestic car manufacturers as a consumption slowdown fuels a price war that is weighing on profitability
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2024, almost 11 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) were sold, a year-on-year increase of 40.7 percent, the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) said Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NEVs accounted for nearly half - 47.6 percent - of all retail sales last year, the association said.
  <br>
  <br>
  By comparison, such vehicles accounted for just 22.6 percent of sales in the European market in November, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
  <br>
  <br>
  In China, NEV sales surpassed 1.3 million units in December, CPCA data showed, up 37.5 percent year-on-year and representing the fifth consecutive month of sales of more than one million.

  <br>
  More than 200 car models saw price cuts last year, compared to 148 in 2023, Cui added.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific said on Thursday that it expects its air ticket fares to continue to "normalise" this year, as the group's passenger capacity returns to pre-pandemic levels from this month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Attending an online briefing, Lavinia Lau, the group's chief customer and commercial officer, noted that while fares for short-haul flights have already largely returned to pre-Covid levels, ticket prices for long-haul flights remain high due to robust demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's because of the supply-demand imbalance primarily between China and the US. Some of the direct flights [between the two countries] have not resumed. That's why a lot of passengers still transited via Hong Kong to get on our US flights," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do expect as we continue to add more and more flights, there'll likely be continued normalisation of yields," Lau said, adding that the group has hired over 7,000 new staff last year to cope with the rising demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Rebecca Sharpe, the group's chief financial officer, noted that the company has seen solid growth in its cargo business last year, thanks to a surge in e-commerce shipments from the mainland to long-haul destinations like the US and Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  But she warned that there could be a drop in demand going forward, and the company will closely monitor the tariff risks from the US going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nonetheless, she said the group is expecting strong financial results in the second half of this year, driven by its cargo business and fuel price declines.

    More tax concessions needed despite budget deficit: EY

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Consulting firm EY on Thursday called on the government to roll out more tax concessions, although it expected the budget deficit would double.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm estimated that Hong Kong’s budget deficit would be HK$98 billion, while accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecast the gap at HK$95 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, government officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  EY noted that governemnt revenue from land premiums and stamp duty fell short of expectations, despite the easing of property cooling measures last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the consultancy's financial services tax leader for Hong Kong, Paul Ho, said authorities should cut tax for real estate investors and commodity traders to boost the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Providing those concessions will actually attract more businesses and investors and capital to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tax concessions or some kind of tax measures that could benefit and attract investors will actually overall help the growth of the Hong Kong economy."
  <br>
  <br>
  PwC also called for similar moves, suggesting the government reduce tax for research and development activities in the Greater Bay Area.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, rose 0.2 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was in line with the previous year's pace.
  <br>
  <br>
  Consumer inflation rose 0.1 percent last month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, slower than the 0.2 percent gain in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  December's growth was the weakest since April 2024, however it matched forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory deflation, meanwhile, extended to a 27th month, although the producer price index recorded a slower decline of 2.3 percent year on year in December, compared with a 2.5 percent fall in November. Analysts had expected a 2.4 percent decline.
  <br>

 Wall Street logged modest gains on Wednesday as investors awaited a government employment report due this week while assessing the prospect of further interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones added 0.3 percent to 42,635, while the S&P 500 picked up by 0.2 percent to 5,918.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq lost 0.1 percent to 19,478.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's been up and down most of the day," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the biggest of the headwinds thus far this week has been the surge in yields in the Treasury market," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Minutes released on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's recent policy meeting showed that several officials raised concerns the fight against inflation may have stalled.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think it very much corroborated the idea that the Fed is willing to take some time before they cut rates again," Hogan noted.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock market is closed on Thursday to mark the death of former US president Jimmy Carter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, traders will be eyeing the first government jobs report released this year, on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the US private sector added fewer jobs than expected in December according to payroll firm ADP, with employment rising by 122,000 jobs, down from 146,000 in November. (AFP)

<img alt="Meta's move is seen as bowing to criticism from conservatives as US President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office for a second time. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786576_1_20250108090923.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Meta's shock announcement that it is ending its US fact-checking program triggered scathing criticism on Tuesday from disinformation researchers who warned it risked opening the floodgates for false narratives.
 <br>
  <br>
  Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was going to "get rid" of its third-party fact-checkers in the United States, in a sweeping policy shift.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a major step back for content moderation at a time when disinformation and harmful content are evolving faster than ever," said Ross Burley, co-founder of the non-profit Centre for Information Resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  As an alternative, Zuckerberg said Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, would use "Community Notes similar to X" in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Community Notes is a crowd-sourced moderation tool that X has promoted as the way for users to add context to posts, but researchers have repeatedly questioned its effectiveness in combating falsehoods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta's announcement was cheered by conservative supporters of US President-elect Donald Trump, who said the move had "probably" been in response to his threats against the company and Zuckerberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meta began fact checks in December 2016, after Trump was elected to his first term, in response to criticism that “fake news” was spreading on its platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years, the tech giant boasted it was working with more than 100 organisations in over 60 languages to combat misinformation. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Tuesday as traders digested economic data which lowered the likelihood of an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Services sector and job openings data pointed to price pressures and a relatively robust labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Given the Fed's dual mandate from Congress to tackle inflation and unemployment, Tuesday's data suggest there is no burning need to cut interest rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have some relatively minor numbers today, but they pointed to things that are not at all Fed friendly: higher prices and a more robust labour economy," said Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones faired best of the three major indices on Wall Street, closing down 0.4 percent at 42,528.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,909, while the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.9 percent to close at 19,489.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the stock markets fell, yields on US Treasurys rose, with the yield on the popular 10-year US Treasury rising by six basis points to around 4.7 percent on growing fears that President-elect Trump's threats to impose tariffs could prove inflationary.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 24 hours, futures traders have raised their expectations that the Fed will pause interest rate cuts at its next rate meeting this month, according to data from CME Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, chip titan Nvidia plunged 6.2 percent after chief executive Jensen Huang's keynote address at a tech conference failed to impress investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there was good news for pharmaceutical giant Moderna, which jumped 11.7 percent as flu and Covid-19 cases continued to rise across the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are now looking ahead to the release of job data on Wednesday and Friday of this week, which will provide key information on the overall health of the labour market. (AFP)

 More than 3,600 global finance and business figures will attend the annual Asian Financial Forum (AFF) which is set to kick off in Hong Kong next Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive John Lee; Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank; and Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on artificial intelligence will be among the speakers for the event, touching on the shifting global economic landscape and its impact on mainland China, as well as the development and governance of AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  The theme of the 18th edition of the forum is "Powering the Next Growth Engine".
  <br>
  <br>
  While AI is expected to be a key focus, Patrick Lau, deputy executive director of the Trade Development Council, told RTHK that the event will also explore other fields that are considered as new drivers for the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are also seeing family offices and wealth management, together with philanthropy, as another area of high growth, especially leveraging in Hong Kong's strength as an international financial centre," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Green and sustainability will continue to be very important going forward. Last but not least, we have many new friends in Asean and the Middle East, so Islamic finance is another big area [in focus] for Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting the SAR's financial markets have undergone a series of reforms, including a road map on sustainability disclosure and a policy statement on responsible application of AI in the financial markets, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said the forum will showcase the SAR's latest financial advantages while exploring new collaborations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Luanne Lim, chairwoman of the AFF Steering Committee and Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of HSBC, said despite greater uncertainties this year with increased tariff risks, Asia will continue to be the global growth engine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The region's gross domestic product is expected to grow 4.4 percent this year, outpacing the 2.7 percent global average target.

    'Putting Tencent, CATL on US list is suppression'

<img alt="The US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery maker CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786435_1_20250107115416.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Tuesday accused Washington of "unjustified suppression" after the US Defence Department added tech giant Tencent and battery manufacturer CATL to a list of companies it says are affiliated with the military.
 <br>
  <br>
  "China is always firmly opposed to the US side's generalisation of the concept of national security, the establishment of various discriminatory lists, the unreasonable suppression of Chinese enterprises and the curbing of China's high-quality development," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We urge the US side to immediately correct its wrong practices," Guo said, adding China would "take the necessary measures to resolutely protect the rights of Chinese companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless, drone maker Autel Robotics, and China's largest shipping company Cosco Shipping Holdings, according to a document published on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two entities owned by Chinese state-owned oil major China National Offshore Oil Corporation were also listed, CNOOC China Ltd and CNOOC International Trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under US law as the "Section 1260H list," designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to US entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them.
  <br>
  <br>
  It could also add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong-listed shares of Tencent fell as much as seven percent in early trade on Tuesday, while the US-traded shares of the company, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell eight percent in over-the-counter trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was "clearly a mistake."
  <br>
  <br>
  It added: "We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  CATL, the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker whose Shenzhen-listed shares dropped more than five percent, also called the designation a mistake, saying it "is not engaged in any military-related activities."
  <br>
  <br>
  A Quectel spokesperson said the company "does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error." Quectel's shares fell nearly seven percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cosco's HK-listed shares dropped more than four percent. (Agencies)

 Tech sector gains helped US indexes recoup some holiday-season losses.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 32.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,975.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 25.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 42,706.56, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 243.30, or 1.2 percent, to 19,864.98.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies were the clear leaders, including those with A-I exposure. Nvidia climbed 3.4 percent to top its record set in November ahead of a speech by CEO Jensen Huang at the annual CES convention in Las Vegas after trading ended for the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia and other AI stocks keep climbing despite criticism that they're overbought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith said on late Friday the company is on track to invest about US$80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centres to train AI models this fiscal year. Smith said AI is the biggest opportunity “to harness new technology to invigorate the nation’s economy” since the invention of electricity. Microsoft rose 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uber Technologies rose 2.7 percent higher after the ride-hailing app said it would accelerate US$1.5 billion in purchases of its own stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Steel climbed 8.1 percent after it and Japan’s Nippon Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to buy its Pittsburgh-based rival. (AP)

<img alt="US and Nippon Steel are mounting a legal challenge against President Joe Biden's decision to block the deal. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1786361_1_20250106211435.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nippon Steel and US Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly US$15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based American steel maker.
 <br>
  <br>
  The suit, filed on Monday in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process.
  <br>
  <br>
  “From the outset of the process, both Nippon Steel and US Steel have engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security, including by revitalising communities that rely on American steel, bolstering the American steel supply chain, and strengthening America’s domestic steel industry," the companies said in a prepared statement Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Nippon Steel is the only partner both willing and able to make the necessary investments.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Nippon Steel had promised to invest US$2.7 billion in US Steel’s ageing blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting US government approval.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  While administration officials have said the decision was unrelated to Japan's relationship with the US — this is the first time a US president has blocked a merger between a US and Japanese firm. (AP)

    XPeng seals new partnership deal with Volkswagen

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of Chinese EV maker XPeng jumped sharply after the company announced an expanded strategic partnership with German automaker Volkswagen to build the largest electric vehicle supercharging network in China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The two companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), under which the two parties will open up their respective fast-charging networks to each other's customers, and work together to build a ultra-fast charging network in the country that comprises over 20,000 charging terminals covering 420 cities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of XPeng Motors jumped as much as five percent in the morning session in Hong Kong, before retreating to HK$46.45 at noon, 3.9 percent higher than the close in the previous session.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two sides will also explore their joint construction of co-branded ultra-fast charging stations in China to improve customer experience, the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  XPeng and Volkswagen forged a partnership in July 2023, when Volkswagen bought 4.99 percent of XPeng for about US$700 million with plans to jointly launch two Volkswagen-branded EV models by 2026 for the mid-sized car market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Volkswagen later said it had developed a new architecture for smart electric vehicles with XPeng that would help it offer more affordable EVs in its largest market. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's services activity expanded at the fastest pace in seven months in December, buoyed by accelerated growth in domestic demand, although overseas orders declined, according to a private sector survey showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global Services purchasing managers' index (PMI), which provides an independent snapshot of operating conditions in industries as such retail and tourism, rose to 52.2 in December from 51.5 the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  That growth pace was the fastest since May 2024, surpassing the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The readings also broadly align with the country's official PMI data released last week, which saw non-manufacturing activity considerably recover to 52.2 in December, after a neutral reading of 50.0 in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the survey showed that new business sub-index rose to 52.7 in December from 51.8 in November. However, inflows from abroad fell for the first time since August 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  A business confidence reading remained positive but dipped to the second-lowest since March 2020, with companies worried by potential international trade disruption after Donald Trump returns to the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports could also face tariff risks under a second Trump administration. Authorities have recently introduced measures to revitalise growth. (Reuters)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Saturday warned that promoting economic development amid a fiscal deficit would be Hong Kong's "main challenge", saying the government is studying how to boost income and cut costs to achieve a balance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on RTHK's "Voices from the Hall", where he gathered public feedback ahead of the upcoming budget, Chan said Hong Kong's economy grew steadily in the first three quarters of 2024 but not as strongly as expected due to high interest rates and geopolitical factors.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the government is focusing on cost-cutting to tackle a deficit estimated to be just below HK$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Although we need to move forward with public works projects and develop the Northern Metropolis, we have to prioritise developments according to their urgency," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "At the same time, we need to study how to increase revenue, based on the principle that people who can afford to pay more do pay more, to minimise the impact on Hongkongers."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan dismissed suggestions that Hong Kong's property slump would drop in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our property market has been experiencing an adjustment period, due to external factors and the high interest rate environment, among other reasons," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] property prices in Hong Kong have stabilised and transaction volume has increased."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also insisted the government will not restore a land-sale mechanism, which was scrapped more than a decade ago, in response to an attendee's call.
  <br>
  <br>
  Abolished in 2013, the application-based mechanism had allowed developers to apply for, and then offer a price for sites listed by the government, before authorities put the plot up for sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the government takes the lead with every quarterly land sale. We can assess the situation to see how many plots of land we're putting up for sale, what type of land is being sold, and how we're going to put those parcels out to market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  After some attendees wanted to discuss the government's HK$2 transport subsidy scheme, the financial chief said labour and welfare officials are studying different views on the matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary is set to deliver his next budget speech on February 26.
