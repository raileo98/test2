<img alt="Daniel Kwok, an independent art consultant, says that art fairs and auctions will give the city's art market a boost. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797660_1_20250327130541.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert has said that ongoing art shows and upcoming auctions will give the mainland and Hong Kong art scene a boost, and serve as a barometer for future market performance.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last year, the broader art market suffered a notable hit, with sales of modern and contemporary works declining by about 40 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of traditional Chinese artworks also fared poorly, with transactions for Chinese painting and calligraphy auctions dropping by more than 20 percent year on year to 12.6 billion yuan last year, according to independent consultant Daniel Kwok.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I would say the traditional Chinese art market remained depressed last year, as the weak performance of the real economy and financial markets has clearly reduced buyers’ interest in the art market," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though stock markets in mainland China and Hong Kong seem to be recovering, collectors and buyers still need time to rebuild their confidence," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Kwok said that events such as Art Basel and Art Central, as well as auctions next month, will offer more clues on whether sentiment in the art market has improved, and if Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had any effect on collectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe Art Basel and Art Central will create an exciting weekend for Hong Kong, providing a direct boost to both our cultural and tourism industries. These events also showcase the strength of the Hong Kong art market," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the art specialist noted that despite the economic downturn, interest in Chinese porcelain antiques have been growing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Because those imperial porcelain made for the emperors are all produced with exceptional craftsmanship, so even by today's standards, these pieces remain stunning to us," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said another hot trend is Ming-style wood furniture famous for its intricate designs and Huanghuali wood – which comes from a rare species of rosewood. He noted that a Huanghuali wood table was sold for more than 45 million yuan on the mainland last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, Kwok cautioned that the heightened tension between China and the US might weigh on the art market.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that US tariff hikes may affect art shipments between the two countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I believe the unstable international climate will make buyers more cautious and conservative,” he explained.

    Home prices drop to lowest level in nearly nine years

<img alt="Home prices continued to decline last month. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797650_1_20250327120658.jpg&q=65">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong home prices slumped for the third month in a row in February, dropping to their lowest level in almost nine years.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Rating and Valuation Department on Thursday said prices fell almost 0.9 percent from the month before, following a decline of 0.7 percent in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The official home price index in February was at its lowest level since July 2016.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents, meanwhile, were up 0.3 percent from January, reaching their highest level in five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest data, Eddie Kwok, executive director of valuation and advisory services at property consultancy firm CBRE Hong Kong, said the city's overall property prices were still "largely stable" and the latest declines were partially due to reduced transaction activities during the Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he expects market sentiment to turn positive in the months ahead as the SAR government has reduced stamp duty to HK$100 for properties valued up to HK$4 million, adding that the stock market revival could also lend support.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see the residential property prices are bottoming out," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "However, as developers are pushing units to capture pent-up demand, it might be difficult for the residential market to record a strong rebound," he said, adding that price increases might only apply to newly built units.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said he expects rental prices to continue to rise, especially over the summer, because they will be boosted by demand from new immigrants as well as non-local students.

    Japan warns of 'significant impact' of US tariffs

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's government on Thursday warned of a "significant impact" on its economic ties with the United States -- and on global trade -- after US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on cars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo is a close economic and strategic US ally, with its firms the biggest investors in the United States and one in 10 Japanese jobs are connected to the auto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump announced on Wednesday 25 percent tariffs "on all cars that are not made in the United States" effective 12.01am eastern time on April 3.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who last month held friendly talks with Trump at the White House, said Japan was reviewing an "appropriate" response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan has made significant investments and significant job creation, which doesn't apply to all countries... we are the number one (country) in investment in the United States," Ishiba added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US president's understanding on this is significantly deepening. However, various things are happening, so we are considering all kinds of countermeasures," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi went further, calling the tariffs "extremely regrettable" and warning of major effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe that the current measures and other broad-based trade restrictions by the US government could have a significant impact on the economic relationship between Japan and the US, as well as on the global economy and the multilateral trading system," Hayashi told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In response to this announcement, we have again told the US government that this measure was extremely regrettable and we strongly urged the US government to exclude Japan from the scope of this measure," Hayashi said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's announcement hammered carmakers in Asia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's top-selling automaker Toyota at midday was down 2.7 percent, while Nissan shed 2.6 percent and Honda was off 2.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In South Korea, Hyundai shares dipped 4.0 percent. (AFP)

 Asian shares mostly skidded with Wall Street on Thursday while the dollar hovered near a three-week high after US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all auto imports, ratcheting up a global trade war that risks fuelling inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, however, the Hang Seng Index rose 60.54 points, or 0.26 percent, to open at 23,543.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, led by heavy losses in automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Toyota Motor shares tumbled 3.4 percent, and both Mazda Motor and Subaru plunged about 6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.7 percent.

    Canada PM dubs US auto tariffs 'direct attack'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reacted with anger on Wednesday to US President Donald Trump's imposition of import tariffs on cars, branding it a "direct attack" on his country.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We will defend our workers. We'll defend our companies. We'll defend our country. And we'll defend it together," said Carney.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will hurt us, but through this period, by being together, we will emerge stronger."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said earlier Wednesday that he was placing 25 percent tariffs on auto imports and, to underscore his intention, he stated “This is permanent.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney said he needs to see the details of Trump's executive order before taking retaliatory measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called it unjustified and said he would leave the election campaign to go to Ottawa on Thursday to chair his special Cabinet committee on US relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney earlier announced a CA$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that would protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump’s tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Autos are Canada’s second largest export, and Carney noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Canada will be there for auto workers,” he said. (Agencies)

    Trump hints at lower tariffs for China over TikTok

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would be willing to reduce tariffs to get a deal done with TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to sell the short video app used by 170 million Americans.
 <br>
  <br>
  ByteDance has an April 5 deadline to find a non-Chinese buyer for TikTok or face a US ban on national security grounds that was supposed to have taken effect in January under a 2024 law.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he was willing to extend the deadline if an agreement over the social media app was not reached.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done," Trump told reporters on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  TikTok did not immediately comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has used tariffs as a bargaining chip in the TikTok negotiations in the past.
  <br>
  <br>
  On January 20, his first day in office, he warned that he could impose tariffs on China if Beijing failed to approve a US deal with TikTok. Earlier this month, Trump hiked his additional tariffs on all imports from China to 20 percent up from 10 percent issued in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vice President JD Vance has said he expects the general terms of an agreement that resolves the ownership of the social media platform to be reached by April 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law, passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app briefly went dark in January after the US Supreme Court upheld the ban, but flickered back to life days later once Trump took office. Trump quickly issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 and said last month that he could further extend that deadline to give himself time to shepherd a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House has been involved to an unprecedented level in the closely watched deal talks, effectively playing the role of investment bank. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks veered off course on Wednesday after the White House said President Donald Trump would announce fresh tariffs on the auto sector after markets close.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.3 percent at 42,454.79, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.1 percent to 5,712.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.0 percent to 17,899.01, while the CBOE Volatility Index -- Wall Street's so-called "fear gauge" -- jumped seven percent, reflecting market jitters.
  <br>
  <br>
  The turn in market sentiment followed White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's remarks earlier Wednesday that Trump would unveil the "auto industry" tariffs at 4:00 pm (2000 GMT).
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's the continuation of worries regarding the tariffs and the impact on the economy," Peter Cardillo from Spartan Capital Securities told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone is (also) waiting to see what the reciprocal tariffs are going to be on April the 2nd," he added. "So it's a continuation of this wall of worries."
  <br>
  <br>
  US automakers fell on the news, with Tesla closing down 5.6 percent.
  <br>

  General Motors shed 3.1 percent, while Ford initially slipped, before reversing course to finish up 0.1 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on auto imports Wednesday, in a move set to fuel tensions with trading partners ahead of further promised levies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  "What we're going to be doing is a 25 percent tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. If they're made in the United States, it is absolutely no tariff," he said at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is set to take effect April 2 -- with duties to be collected from April 3 -- and impact foreign-made cars and light trucks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The levies will be in addition to those already in place for the goods, and Trump added that "this is permanent."
  <br>
  <br>
  Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has imposed fresh tariffs on imports from major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China -- as well as a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he previously offered automakers temporary reprieve from the levies affecting North America.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty over Trump's trade plans and worries they could trigger a downturn have roiled financial markets, with consumer confidence also falling in recent months amid fears of the tariffs' effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street slumped ahead of Trump's announcement, with the tech-focused Nasdaq plunging 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in automaker General Motors closed 3.1 percent down, while Ford eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has referred to levies as a way to raise government revenue, revitalize American industry and press countries on US priorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  But targeting imported cars could strain ties with countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico and Germany -- which are close US partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 50 percent of cars sold in the United States are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Center for Automotive Research has previously estimated that US tariffs -- including those on metals and imported autos -- could increase the price of a car by thousands of dollars and weigh on the jobs market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides the automobile industry, Trump is also eyeing sector-specific tariffs on industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, he reaffirmed his intent to impose tariffs on lumber and pharmaceuticals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's announcement on autos comes ahead of April 2, which Trump has dubbed "Liberation Day" for the world's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has promised reciprocal levies on the date, tailored to different trading partners in an attempt to remedy practices that Washington deemed unfair.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday he said these duties will impact all countries but that they would be "very lenient."
  <br>
  <br>
  It is unclear if further sector-specific tariffs would be announced on April 2, with the White House noting this week that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump told reporters Monday that he might "give a lot of countries breaks" eventually, without elaborating.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he added Tuesday that he did not want too many exceptions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes of a narrower tariff rollout had given financial markets a boost, but investors remain jittery over rapid policy changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump has invoked emergency economic powers for some recent tariffs, his auto levies may build on a previous government investigation completed in 2019, former US trade official Ryan Majerus told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  The probe found that excessive imports were weakening the internal economy and might impair national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the time, one recommendation was to institute tariffs of up to 25 percent to bolster US production of autos and parts.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The advantage with autos," said Majerus, now a partner at the King & Spalding law firm, is that the administration "can act a lot quicker if they want, as opposed to, say in lumber or copper, where they had to launch investigations."
  <br>
  <br>
  US trade partners have been furthering talks with Washington as Trump's reciprocal tariff deadline looms.
  <br>
  <br>
  EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic met his American counterparts Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade envoy Jamieson Greer this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sefcovic said on social media that "the EU's priority is a fair, balanced deal instead of unjustified tariffs." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD aims to double its sales outside China to more than 800,000 cars in 2025 and will look to overcome tariffs by assembling cars locally, its chairman has told analysts on an earnings call.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which sold 417,204 units overseas in 2024, expects to see "a substantial rise" in its market share in Britain, which is "very open" to competitive Chinese products, according to a transcript of the call by Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also sees "great opportunities" to grow rapidly in Latin American and Southeast Asian countries, where the governments and people are friendly towards Chinese brands, he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With governments abroad weighing or levying tariffs against Chinese-made cars, BYD plans to keep its cost advantage by purchasing key components from China and assembling the vehicles in local markets, Wang added, without specifying the countries he was referring to.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the Tuesday meeting, Wang also told analysts he expected to see the majority of BYD's profits coming from overseas markets "at a certain stage".
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD is currently building a factory in Brazil, its biggest market outside China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carmaker is also building factories in Thailand, Hungary and Turkey. (Reuters)

 Lingering hopes that US president Donald Trump's planned tariff blitz next week will not be as painful as feared lifted most Asian markets on Wednesday, though uncertainty about Trump's policies and the US economy tempered optimism.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong battled to edge higher a day after tanking more than two percent on profit-taking and selling in the tech sector.

  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index ended the day up 0.6 percent at 23,483.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ta Kung Pao newspaper on Wednesday renewed its criticism of the sale by CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an editorial, Ta Kung Pao said there would be severe consequences if the conglomerate continues on this "wrong path".
  <br>
  <br>
  It said the deal to sell ports in Panama and elsewhere to an investment group led by the American firm BlackRock should not be considered a normal business decision on national security grounds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also said the proposed sale undermined China's national interests.

<img alt="Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797399_1_20250326062321.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks mostly closed higher on Tuesday, building on earlier gains amid hopes that US President Donald Trump might take a narrower approach to upcoming tariffs than originally expected.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 42,587.50, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index advanced 0.2 percent to 5,776.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.5 percent to 18,271.86.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The absence of bad news is good news for stocks," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that there has been "so much bad news" over the last few weeks that the respite on Tuesday allowed investors to breathe a sigh of relief.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, markets are waiting for further hints about Trump's upcoming tariff rollout, with the president having promised "reciprocal tariffs" tailored to each trading partner on April 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Trump earlier signaled that sector-specific levies hitting industries like automobiles and semiconductors could come around the same day, the White House said Monday that the situation remained fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's market gains came despite US consumer confidence falling for a fourth straight month in March, the Conference Board said, with survey respondents flagging growing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's trade plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, new US home sales picked up slightly less than expected last month, with analysts warning that tariffs could raise costs for homebuilders -- weighing on the market subsequently.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be awaiting updates on US GDP data released Thursday, and the release of a key inflation gauge due Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asia's economy is likely to continue its robust growth this year despite challenges, according to a report by the Boao Forum for Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the "Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2025" came as the forum kicked off its annual gathering in Hainan province, with about 2,000 representatives from more than 60 countries and regions attending.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report said economic growth in Asia is expected to reach 4.5 percent this year, slightly higher than a 4.4 percent increase in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's economy, the world's second largest, is forecast to grow by 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And the continent will continue to be the key driver of global growth this year, contributing to nearly half of the world's economic output.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report also cited challenges such as uncertainties caused from US tariffs, complicated geopolitical dynamics, as well as a high level of inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Zhang Jun, the forum’s secretary general, said the current global environment is undergoing profound changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that China is calling for unity to meet the challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The theme of this year's annual conference is closely related to the current major issues and various challenges, which will help us better navigate the direction going forward amid the changing situation, to seek for common development," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We hope that the meeting this year will send a strong signal to the international community to maintain confidence, unity and cooperation, overcoming the difficulties and building the future together."
  <br>
  <br>
  Also attending the forum was Chief Executive John Lee, who said Hong Kong is a global city connecting the world, and that the SAR will continue to promote free trade and market liberalisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are devoted to deepening international exchange and collaboration. Hong Kong has signed investment agreements covering 33 economies, and free trade agreements covering 21 economies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We aspire to add the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – the world's largest free trade pact – to our free trade agreements soon, and better contribute to regional cooperation."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the key topics at the forum lasting through Friday include the development of artificial intelligence and sustainable development.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will deliver a keynote speech at the opening plenary.

 Equities diverged on Tuesday, as investors struggled to extend Wall Street's rally despite easing fears over US president Donald Trump's planned tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Asian stocks fluctuated through the day, with Hong Kong sinking 2.3 percent to 23,344, weighed by a drop of around six percent in tech giant Xiaomi.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaomi had raised US$5.5 billion in a mega share sale as it looked to expand its electric vehicle business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal, which comes after a similar move this month by EV firm BYD, stoked worries about market liquidity. (AFP)

  The remarks were made by Qi Bin, deputy director of the central government's liaison office, who noted that Hong Kong's stock market is one of the best outperforming markets in the world this year, with average daily turnover reaching nearly HK$300 billion since last month, indicating a strong return of global capital to the city.
  <br>
  <br>
  Qi, a former vice-president of China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, said the SAR should roll out more reforms to drive the city's capital market growth, including a blueprint that offers the market medium to long-term expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, he pointed out that a blueprint made by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission in 2008 helped make the country's capital market the second largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The blueprint offered a comprehensive analysis of the country's capital market, a slate of reform measures and clear timetables.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This blueprint [in Hong Kong] will provide suggestions for improvements to Hong Kong's capital markets," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A dedicated task force will solicit feedback from leading global investors and financial institutions for the coordinated growth of both Hong Kong and Asia's capital market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Other proposed measures, he added, include "accelerated integration between the city's capital markets and mainland's high-tech enterprises," such as emerging artificial intelligence and robotics firms, while ramping up market supervision to fend off systemic risks and introducing extra long-term funds, including foreign exchange reserves and social security funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also noted that Beijing will offer strong support for the city's upcoming inaugural "Hong Kong Global Financial and Industry Summit" in June, when more than 1,000 chief executives from around the world will gather and discuss new projects in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Acting Chief Executive Eric Chan said at the same event that there are signs that global capital is returning as the city's total deposits rose by 7.1 percent last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the SAR will also continue to strengthen its position as an offshore yuan centre.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's role as a super connector has never been more vital," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We remain the world's largest offshore renminbi business hub, each day processing close to 80 percent of cross border renminbi payments outside the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are now working to enable multi-currency settlements and enrich renminbi products, offering REITs under Stock Connect and exploring new initiatives with mainland regulators," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai warned about a potential "bubble" from the over-construction of data centres in the world, following the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said that some projects were being built without clear customers in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "My question to them is, has Microsoft or Google or Amazon or even Alibaba agreed to start using your data centres once it's built? Do you have any agreements? And they said 'no.' So I start to see the beginning of some kind of bubble,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tsai also said that private enterprise confidence had increased on the mainland after President Xi Jinping met a group of entrepreneurs in Beijing last month.

    Tesla sales fall off a cliff in Europe

<div class="itemFullText">
 European sales of Tesla electric cars dropped 49 percent in January and February compared with the same period a year earlier, the ACEA manufacturers' association said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Ageing models are one factor behind the plunge, but electric vehicle clients may also be refusing to buy in protest of Tesla's billionaire owner Elon Musk since he became a key supporter of US President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has been leading a vocal and divisive cost-cutting drive at the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Tesla dealerships around the United States have been vandalised in recent weeks and the company's stock price has plummeted over the past month.
  <br>
  <br>
  New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year, giving the company a market share of just 1.1 percent, the ACEA said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In February alone, Tesla registrations were down 47 percent at 11,743.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sales drop came even as overall electric vehicle sales jumped 28.4 percent over the first two months of this year to 255,489 – for an EU market share of 15.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But for ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries, "The latest new car registration figures confirm that market demand for battery electric vehicles remains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress."
  <br>
  <br>
  She cited a need for tax and purchasing incentives for clients and investments in recharging stations, at a time when the EU is preparing to ease emission reduction targets for struggling European automakers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hybrid-electric vehicles continued to be the biggest market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations – for a 35.2 percent market share.
  <br>
  <br>
  That outpaced both petrol and diesel models, with market shares of 29.1 percent and 9.7 percent in February. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index lost 262.24 points, or 1.1 percent, to open at 23,643.32 on Tuesday.

  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that the US President Donald Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.

  April 2 is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of "reciprocal" measures -- imposing tariffs on other countries equal to those in place against the United States. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korean auto giant Hyundai on Monday announced a multi-billion-dollar investment in the United States, including a new US$5.8 billion steel plant.
 <br>
  <br>
  The plant, which will be based in the US state of Louisiana, "will create 1,300 American jobs," Hyundai executive chairman Euisun Chung told reporters at a White House event alongside President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  With an annual capacity of 2.7 million tonnes, it is part of Hyundai's US$21 billion investment in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hyundai's announcement makes it the latest firm to announce plans to invest billions of dollars into the United States since Trump's return to power in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president has repeatedly threatened to impose painful tariffs on companies that do not relocate manufacturing jobs to the United States from overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response, domestic and foreign firms, including Apple and Oracle, have announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into US projects over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars are coming to this country at levels never seen before," Trump told reporters on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The investment was "a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hyundai will be producing steel in America and making its cars in America, and as a result, they'll not have to pay any tariffs," he added. (AFP, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    'Trump's fees on Chinese ships will backfire'

<img alt="A container ship sails beneath the Golden Gate Bridge as it makes its way into port in San Francisco. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797249_1_20250325083906.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump's plan to revitalise the US shipbuilding industry is likely to backfire because it relies on proposed fees on China-linked vessels that will hurt domestic ship operators, seaports, exporters and jobs, industry executives said at US Trade Representative (USTR) hearings on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  At issue are proposed stacking fees on China-built vessels that could top US$3 million per US port call.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration says the fees would curb China's growing commercial and military dominance on the high seas and promote domestically built vessels.
  <br>
  <br>
  US steelworker unions, US steel producers and Democratic lawmakers support the effort, saying it will boost domestic industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the idea has sent a shockwave through the domestic maritime industry because it threatens the survival of the same shipping companies and customers that would drive demand for orders from the US shipyards Trump wants to rebuild.
  <br>
  <br>
  "National interest will not be served if the effort to boost American shipbuilding unintentionally destroys American-owned carriers," Edward Gonzalez, CEO of Florida-based Seaboard Marine, the largest US-owned international ocean cargo carrier, testified on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Like many US operators, Seaboard relies on vessels made in China. It has 16 China-built ships in its fleet of 24 vessels, according to maritime data provider Alphaliner.
  <br>
  <br>
  US vessel operators said the fees on Chinese-linked vessels also would push more US cargo to foreign-owned ocean shipping companies that have resources to better weather the change.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the USTR, China's share of the shipbuilding market grew from less than five percent in 1999 to more than 50 percent in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  US shipyards turn out fewer than 10 ships annually while China's produce 1,000, speakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, industry executives said shipbuilders in Japan and South Korea would struggle to meet demand in the years it would take US shipyards to build up capacity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Replacing existing China-built vessels is not like flipping a light switch, said Kathy Metcalf, CEO of the Chamber of Shipping of America. "Penalising China and the US marine transportation system is not an acceptable result." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed higher on Monday as traders welcomed news that the administration of President Donald Trump may dial down upcoming tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  A White House official told AFP the sector-specific levies "may or may not happen" as planned on April 2, adding that the situation was fluid.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 percent to end trading at 42,583.32, and the broad-based S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent to 5,767.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.3 percent to 18,188.59.
  <br>
  <br>
  The trade news was "definitely the main cause" of the rise in Wall Street stocks, Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors clearly hate the idea of tariffs," he said. "So any news that implies that the burden of tariffs will be will be lighter than expected will be taken as a positive by the market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Elon Musk's Tesla shot up 11.9 percent as traders piled back into the embattled stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  And United Airlines saw its share price jump 7.2 percent after announcing it was hiking fees on some credit cards and airline lounges. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD saw a surge in revenue last year, a stock filing showed on Monday, surpassing the US$100 billion mark and beating rival Tesla as the car-giant firm accelerates its overseas expansion.
 <br>
  <br>
  BYD has emerged in recent years as the clear leader in the China's highly competitive electric vehicle market, which is the largest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  The nation's automotive champion recorded over 777 billion yuan in revenue for 2024, eclipsing the 708 billion yuan in revenue last year announced previously by Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD's figure represented a 29 percent increase from 2023 and was higher than a Bloomberg forecast of 766 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit last year amounted to 40.3 billion yuan, up 34 percent from 2023 and reaching a record high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's stock price also reached an all-time peak this month, after it unveiled new battery technology that it said allows a vehicle to travel up to 470 kilometres after charging for just five minutes. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.91 percent to close at 23,905.56 on a mixed day for equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 1.24 percent to end at 8,850.69, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.72 percent to end at 5,736.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equity markets were mixed as worries about fresh US tariffs pencilled in for next week were tempered by a report that Donald Trump was considering a more targeted approach.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investor sentiment has been jolted in recent weeks by fears that Trump's hardball policies could deal a painful blow to the global economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He has caused ructions on trading floors since resuming power in January by hitting out at long-standing allies and imposing or threatening swingeing tariffs on imports of an array of goods, including steel and cars.
  <br>
  <br>
  Next Wednesday is now the focus of attention, with Trump labelling it "Liberation Day" as he prepares to unveil a raft of reciprocal measures to counter those in other countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anticipation and pre-positioning ahead of Trump's 'Liberation Day' on April 2 and the impending deluge of tariff-related announcements that will follow in the days/weeks after will be a growing factor that drives price action, sentiment and liquidity in markets this week," said Chris Weston at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the sky begins to bruise and darken, and the atmospheric pressure builds within the capital markets, market players question if it's time to batten down the hatches in preparation for a storm of uncertainty set to be unleashed on markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve last week warned that "uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased" while the central banks of Japan and Britain also warned about the impact of the White House's policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Premier Li Qiang said at the weekend that Beijing was readying for "shocks that exceed expectations" ahead of the latest measures, adding that "instability and uncertainty are on the upswing."
  <br>
  <br>
  His comments came as he met heads of some of the world's biggest companies, including Apple, Qualcomm, FedEx and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, there was some hope among investors amid reports the US administration was considering a more targeted approach to the tariffs, with some countries being hit harder than others, and the measures not being as severe as initially feared.
  <br>
  <br>
  That came after the president said on Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asian markets fluctuated through the day, with Tokyo falling along with Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Bangkok.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Mumbai and Wellington joined Hong Kong in edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt opened on the front foot.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold held around US$3,025, having hit a series of records last week to a peak of more than $3,057 owing to a surge in demand for safe havens. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Laos has signed a US$1.45 billion clean energy deal with a Chinese power plant equipment manufacturer as the country furthers its push into clean power generation and transmission.
 <br>
  <br>
  China Western Power Industrial, along with a Singapore-based construction company, signed the agreement with Xekong Thermal Power Plant in Laos to design, supply, and build a 1,800-megawatt clean energy power project in southern Laos, according to a stock exchange filing by the Sichuan-based company on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of the Shenzhen-listed firm jumped 9.9 percent after the filing. So far this year, the stock has surged 46.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of 2030, with initial designs to be finished by the end of this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the day, the Chinese company also signed a power transmission deal, valued at US$228.8 million, with the same Laotian company.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2022, China Western Power signed a supply and service deal worth US$409 million with another power company in Laos.
  <br>
  <br>
  And last year, a state-owned power company signed an agreement with Laos to expand a wind and solar energy base in the north of the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Laos, a mountainous country, has produced about 80 percent of its electricity from hydropower over the last decade but has struggled to scale up its solar and wind power. (Reuters)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index opened 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, up at 23,749. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1797110_1_20250324110326.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index climbed 59.86 points, or 0.25 percent, to open at 23,749.58 on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That came as financial markets made a mixed start with US stock futures rising but the dollar wavering ahead of a week driven by data, Chinese earnings and the threat of steep US tariff hikes on the horizon.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures were up about 0.6 percent in the morning and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei climbed about 0.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The week holds global purchasing managers index gauges, the US Federal Reserve's preferred inflation reading, inflation data in Australia and Japan, a budget update in Britain and major earnings in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it is likely to be updates on US President Donald Trump's plans to for global reciprocal tariffs from April 2 that drives markets, and after a volatile month for stocks, bonds and currencies, analysts said there is no obvious trade ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's very difficult to really devise a structural playbook," said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You've got to put your mind into the head of the consumer and households," he said, since it has been fears of a slowdown in the world's biggest economy that has led to weeks of selling dollars and stocks and a strong rally for Treasuries.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Anything that feeds into this higher probability of recession, higher probability of a stagflationary environment ... or that price pressures aren't transitory is where we start to get panicky a bit."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has vowed to impose a complicated barrage of tariffs, the details of which are not clear save that they are to be calculated to reflect the impact of foreign tariffs as well as foreign value-added taxes on imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong shares are up 18 percent so far this year, the largest gain of any major market, but a drop of 4.4 percent over two sessions late last week pointed to a pause in the flow of money while traders consider their, and Trump's, next moves.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earnings at automaker BYD, video platform Kuaishou as well as Chinese banks and several property developers will be in focus. In the United States, discount retailer Dollar Tree and up-market athletic clothier Lululemon are on the calendar.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 British finance minister Rachel Reeves is eyeing spending cuts for government officials who work in departments to the value of around 1.5 billion pounds (US$1.94 billion) a year by 2028-29, The Times newspaper reported on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Reeves will likely announce belt-tightening measures to get back on track to meet her fiscal rules next Wednesday when she delivers a half-yearly budget update speech alongside fresh economic and public finance forecasts from Britain's fiscal watchdog.
  <br>
  <br>
  She is expected to reduce the administration budgets for the civil service by 10 percent, saving around 1.5 billion pounds a year by the end of parliament, The Times said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move could put thousands of jobs at risk and covers back office jobs, including in communications and policy, and human resources, but will likely exclude frontline service roles such as the border force and prisons. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed higher Friday after fluctuations, shaking off ongoing economic uncertainty including those triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff plans -- following his comments that these will contain some flexibility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent to 41,985.35, and the broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent as well to 5,667.56.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.5 percent to 17,784.05.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is certainly some hesitation, as we still have a lot of the trade uncertainties ahead of us with the April 2nd reciprocal tariff announcements," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  On April 2, Trump has promised reciprocal levies tailored to each US trading partner, to remedy practices deemed unfair by Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the president told reporters Friday that "there'll be flexibility" in his plans, and markets appeared to react with some relief at day-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kourkafas cautioned however that "we don't know what's going to happen necessarily, how long it's going to last, which could keep volatility elevated."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, shares in package delivery firm FedEx closed 6.5 percent down after it lowered forecasts for this year, noting weakness and uncertainty in the US industrial economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Athletic footwear and apparel giant Nike saw its shares fall by 5.5 percent after earlier reporting a decline in quarterly revenues. (AFP)

  For the first two months of the year taken together, the number of bankruptcy petitions reached 1,606, 15 percent higher from the same period a year earlier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed lower on Thursday, as a Fed-related rally lost steam, and traders looked ahead to the prospect of additional tariffs next month.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down less than 0.1 percent at 41,953.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 5,662, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to close at 17,691.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We started off in the red, went solidly into the green, only to go back into the red, then back into the green and now we're kind of flatlining," CFRA's Sam Stovall told AFP, shortly before markets slipped further into the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think investors are basically going to be treading water until April 2," he added, referring to the date at which US President Donald Trump has said he plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, professional firm Accenture's shares slumped 6.7 percent after announcing that the Trump administration's efficiency drive had begun affecting its business.
  <br>
  <br>
  The business consulting firm said the cost-cutting drive, led by billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk, had hit its federal services business. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The White House on Thursday vowed to impose "big tariffs" on April 2 when US President Donald Trump is to unveil reciprocal levies in a major escalation of his trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's comments came days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Washington is expected to present other countries with a number representing their tariff and other barriers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent's remarks had suggested a possible delay in the activation of some duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been "very clear about his intention for April 2."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big announcements when it comes to reciprocal trade," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And the president will be highlighting the unfair trade practices, the ways in which America has been ripped off by every country around the world, quite frankly."
  <br>
  <br>
  "There will be big tariffs that will be going into effect," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has promised reciprocal duties on both US allies and competitors from April 2, although the exact details of this plan have yet to be released.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bessent had told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo that on the day, "each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said at the time that some duties may not have to go on as a deal "is pre-negotiated," or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's inflation pace eased last month, rising by just 1.4 percent year on year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 1.4 percent is notably lower compared with the two percent annual increase seen in January, according to official data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday also showed that the underlying inflation rate, or the rate excluding the effects of all government one-off relief measures, rose 1.1 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is also lower compared with the 1.6 percent increase seen in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government said the slower pace of inflation was mainly due to the timing of last year's Lunar New Year festival, which fell in February, creasing a high base for comparison for this year, especially in regards to food prices and the costs of package tours.
  <br>
  <br>
  By categories, the biggest price spikes were seen in alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, with the inflation gauge for this segment rising 20.9 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  That's followed by the price increase for gas and water, as the inflation rate for the category rose 13.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Products that saw price declines were clothing and footwear, basic food, and durable goods, with their rates dropping between one and two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, a government spokesperson said the city's overall inflation will remain moderate in the short term.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs pressures might increase somewhat as the economy continues to grow. External price pressures should remain broadly in check, though uncertainties stemming from geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts continue to warrant attention," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 CK Hutchison has reported a 27 percent drop in net profit.
 <br>
  <br>
  Full-year earnings reached HK$17 billion in 2024, down from HK$23.5 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the whole, the Group's underlying operating results were relatively stable" last year despite a one-time issue related to its Vietnam telecommunications business, chairman Victor Li said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for 2025, Li said the operating environment for the group's businesses is expected to be "volatile and unpredictable".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company announced a final dividend of HK$1.514 per share, compared with HK$1.775 the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  The conglomerate recently proposed selling its ports business, including assets near the Panama Canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  That drew criticism from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison did not hold a post-earnings press conference on Thursday. (Additional reporting by AFP)

 Stocks mostly rose on Thursday after US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell suggested any increase in consumer prices caused by tariffs would likely be short-lived, even as the central bank slashed its growth outlook and hiked inflation expectations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's de facto central bank has cautioned that local borrowing costs will remain at a relatively high level for some time as it kept its key interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Thursday came in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve, which also left its target rate steady overnight in a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In response to the US rate policy decision, the HKMA said the move by the Fed was in line with market expectations and that the latest released "dot plot," a data chart providing a snapshot of the Fed's thinking, suggests that the Fed might reduce target rates by a total of 50 basis points by the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, it cautioned that the pace of US interest rate cuts remain quite uncertain due to recent changes in economic indicators and volatility in market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Interest rates in Hong Kong might still remain at relatively high levels for some time, and the extent and pace of future US interest rate cuts are subject to considerable uncertainty," it said in a statement, adding that future rate cuts depend on factors such as US inflation and labour market data, as well as fiscal and trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The public should carefully assess and continue to manage the interest rate risk when making property purchase, mortgage or other borrowing decisions," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, it noted that Hong Kong's financial and monetary markets have continued to operate in a smooth and orderly manner with the liquidity condition remaining stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKMA added that it will continue to closely monitor market developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The city's major commercial banks have also followed suit, with HSBC and Bank of China (Hong Kong) keeping their rates at 5.25 percent and Standard Chartered maintaining its rate at 5.5 percent.

    Trump urges Fed to cut rates as tariffs take effect

<img alt='Donald Trump says "the Fed would be much better off cutting rates". Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796555_1_20250320110749.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Donald Trump urged the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday to cut interest rates to help offset effects of his tariffs, renewing his vocal disagreement with the central bank's decision-making.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Do the right thing," Trump demanded in a Wednesday night post on his Truth Social site, hours after the Fed decided to hold rates steady, while reducing its growth forecast and hiking its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve has pencilled in two rate cuts this year, but chairman Jerome Powell noted that "uncertainty today is unusually elevated" and that inflation is ticking up.
  <br>
  <br>
  Many economists have warned that the tariffs – which are being met with trade retaliation by some countries – threaten to possibly tip the US economy and others into recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has admitted that the economy may suffer "a little disturbance" as his planned levies take hold, but that America is otherwise on the cusp of a "golden age".
  <br>
  <br>
  In Wednesday's message, he again stressed that April 2, when he plans to enact "reciprocal tariffs" designed to reset global trade, would be a "liberation day" for the US economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he wants US interest rates to come down as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy," he posted.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his first term, Trump repeatedly expressed disagreement with the Fed's rate decisions, urging them to be lowered to boost the economy. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged but pointed to increased economic uncertainty, while Treasury bond yields tumbled.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Fed's interest rate decision was expected, but the central bank cut its growth forecast for 2025 and hiked its inflation outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  It has nonetheless still penciled in two rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But yields on the 10-year US Treasury note, a closely-watched proxy of monetary policy, fell sharply as the Fed also slowed the pace at which it will shrink the size of its balance sheet.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,964.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 5,675, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to 17,750.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Uncertainty today is unusually elevated," Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision was published, adding that at least part of a recent inflation uptick was related to the White House tariff policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Powell also communicated some confidence about the US economic outlook, noting key indicators that have stayed solid in spite of surveys showing weakening consumer confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the market liked hearing the Fed Chair sound reasonably upbeat about the economy," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare, who noted that the drop in Treasury yields boosts expectations that mortgage rates also will fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Boeing jumped 6.8 percent as CFO Brian West told a Wall Street conference the company's efforts to improve plane assembly operations were on track so far in the first quarter and struck an upbeat tone on the company's outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  General Mills fell 2.1 percent after reporting a five percent drop in sales as it pointed to a slowdown in demand for snacking and a drop in orders from retailers managing inventories. (AFP)

<img alt="Tencent posts strong fourth quarter financial performances, bolstered by its gaming and advertising businesses. Photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796452_1_20250319182448.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tech giant Tencent on Wednesday reported a stronger than expected fourth-quarter growth, boosted by a surge in gaming and advertising revenue.
 <br>
  <br>
  The firm, which is the largest video game company in the world, and also the operator of WeChat, saw its revenue grow by 11 percent year on year to 172.4 billion yuan (US$23.83 billion) for the quarter ending in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  That was much higher compared with the 168.9 billion yuan expected by the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net profit, meanwhile, was up 90 percent year on year to 51.3 billion yuan during the three month period, also higher than the expected 46.03 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The growth came as its gaming business regained momentum and showed robust recovery since mid-2024, with its domestic gaming revenue rising by 23 percent year on year to 33.2 billion yuan and its global gaming revenue climbing 15 percent to 16 billion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tencent said the increases were due to a low base from the previous year, as well as growth in some of its hit games including "Honour of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite".
  <br>
  <br>
  Successful launches of its new games such as "Dungeon & Fighter Mobile" and "Delta Force" as well as regulatory easing over the nation's gaming sector also helped bolster its growth, it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the full year of 2024, the Shenzhen-headquartered firm registered a profit growth of 68 percent year on year to 194 billion yuan, while revenue grew by eight percent year on year to 660 billion yuan, meeting market expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm also attributed artificial intelligence technology as a driving force to improve its various products.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Starting a few months ago, we have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products,” Tencent said in its earnings statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We believe these stepped-up investments will generate ongoing returns via uplifting productivity in our advertising business and longevity of our games, as well as longer term value from accelerated consumer usage of our AI applications and enterprise adoption of our AI services," the firm added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company proposed a final dividend of HK$4.5 per share for the year, marking a 32 percent rise from a year earlier.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington is expected to present US trading partners on April 2 with a number representing their tariff and other barriers, as it unveils reciprocal levies tailored to each country, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Donald Trump has promised reciprocal duties - on both US allies and competitors alike - from April 2, though his administration has yet to release the exact details of the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What's going to happen on April 2 - each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs," Bessent told Fox Business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to go to them and say, look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labour suppression," he added on "Mornings With Maria."
  <br>
  <br>
  With just over two weeks until April 2, he did not say whether those calculations would be complete for all nations by the deadline, but left open the door to some avoiding reciprocal tariffs on that date.
  <br>
  <br>
  If countries stop their practices, Bessent said, "we will not put up the tariff wall."
  <br>
  <br>
  Some duties "may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated," he said, or because countries swiftly approach Washington for talks once they receive their number.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Monday on social media that April 2 would be "Liberation Day for America," promising to "start taking back some of the vast wealth that has been taken from us."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president's tariff plans and the uncertainty surrounding them have shaken markets in recent weeks, fanning fears that an economic ebb could be in the cards.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Bessent told Fox Business that he saw "no reason we need to have a recession," saying "the underlying economy is healthy."
  <br>
  <br>
  The former hedge fund manager raised the idea of a "pause" as the economy transitions away from "unsustainable" levels of government spending, pledging that the Trump administration would rein in expenditures and bring manufacturing home.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday, Bessent stressed that Trump has identified "critical industries" - like steel and aluminium among manufacturing sectors - for which he hopes to bring production back to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that "we're going to take in substantial revenues," pointing to these as a means to offset the government deficit. (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index lost 42.94 points, or 0.17 percent, to open at 24,697.63 on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their downward slide on Tuesday as worries over the Ukraine and Middle East conflicts added to unease over President Trump's aggressive trade agenda.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to yield a ceasefire, prompting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to pledge continued fighting in Russia's Kursk region.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Israel resumed bombing Gaza in the deadliest attack since a ceasefire came into effect on January 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices spent the entire session in the red on the first day of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.6 percent at 41,581.31.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 1.1 percent to 5,614.66, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.7 percent to 17,504.12.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks had risen the last two days in a partial rebound from declines in recent weeks as mixed economic data and uncertainty about the Trump administration's trade policies spark talk of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The news of what's going on politically, it's still very uncertain," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management. "I don't think there's any new news so far this week that should make the market feel more encouraged."
  <br>
  <br>
  Besides uncertainty over the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, Cahill also pointed to unease over an April 2 deadline when the Trump administration is expected to announce a fresh litany of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Nvidia fell 3.2 percent as chief executive Jensen Huang showcased cutting-edge chips for artificial intelligence at the company's annual developers conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Google parent Alphabet fell 2.4 percent after the tech giant announced it will acquire cloud security platform Wiz for US$32 billion, as it seeks to beef up its cloud computing business for the AI era.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday jailed the former boss of state-owned banking giant Everbright Group for bribery, state media said, the latest official to fall foul of President Xi Jinping's decade-long corruption crackdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities announced the investigation into Li Xiaopeng, the company's former Communist Party secretary and chairman, two years ago and brought him to trial in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  CCTV reported that a court in northeastern Heilongjiang found Li guilty of accepting bribes worth over 60 million yuan between 1994 and 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined six million yuan, CCTV said, adding that he received a lighter punishment for confessing his crimes and cooperating with authorities.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The property and interest obtained through his bribes have been recovered... and turned over to the state treasury," CCTV said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In December, former Everbright chairman Tang Shuangning was jailed for 12 years for embezzlement and bribery. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares in Chinese EV giant BYD surged to a record high on Tuesday after it unveiled new battery technology it says can charge a vehicle in the same time it takes to fill up a petrol car.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company said the battery and charging system, called "Super e-Platform," boasted peak speeds of 1,000 kW, allowing cars to travel up to 470 kilometres after being plugged in for just five minutes.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new technology aims to "fundamentally solve users' charging anxiety," according to founder Wang Chuanfu.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our pursuit is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refuelling time of fuel vehicles," he said at the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed shares in BYD jumped more than six percent to hit a fresh peak at one point on Tuesday before paring some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement positions BYD ahead of arch-rival Tesla, whose Superchargers currently offer charging speeds of 500 kW.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD introduced the Super e-Platform alongside two new EV models that will be the first to feature the system: the Han L sedan and the Tang L SUV.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based company also unveiled plans to build more than 4,000 ultra-fast charging stations nationwide to support the new technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ambitious expansion comes on the heels of remarkable growth, with February sales soaring 161 percent to more than 318,000 electric vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Tesla experienced a steep 49 percent sales decline in the Chinese market during the same period. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rose for the second straight day on Monday following better US retail sales data as markets awaited a Federal Reserve decision later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales for February showed a 0.2 percent increase from the previous month, less than the 0.7 percent expected by analysts, but a step above January's 1.2 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  The data was good enough to keep alive the market's momentum from Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've priced in a lot of the concerns on the trade war," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 41,841.63.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 5,675.12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 17,808.66.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks have been in retreat in recent weeks as President Donald Trump has announced myriad trade actions, implementing some tariffs and delaying other levies in a process that has left markets guessing and generated talk of a possible recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Wednesday's Fed decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  While the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely be pressed on whether uncertainty over tariffs has dimmed the US economic outlook at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development trimmed its growth forecast for the United States, citing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, PepsiCo rose 1.8 percent after announcing it will acquire the low-sugar soda brand Poppi for about US$1.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel jumped 6.8 percent on optimism about the chip company's prospects after it last week named tech industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its new chief executive. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in China accelerated slightly in the first two months of the year, government data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) offered some positive signs, showing retail sales – a key measure of consumer sentiment – increased four percent year-on-year during January and February combined.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS said total retail sales of consumer goods reached over 8.37 trillion yuan for the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales climbed by 3.7 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, in the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  But, the statement warned "domestic effective demand is weak, [and] some enterprises face difficulties in production and operation".
  <br>
  <br>
  "The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production in January and February increased 5.9 percent year-on-year, data showed, slowing from the 6.2 percent growth in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statistics authorities combine many economic indicators for the first two months of the year to account for potential distortions caused by the annual Lunar New Year holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the surveyed urban unemployment rate – China's main metric for measuring unemployment – in February ticked up to 5.4 percent, the NBS said, up 0.2 percentage points from the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing announced earlier this month that it is targeting GDP growth of five percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with an intensified trade war under US President Donald Trump, the nation’s officials are looking to boost domestic consumption to reduce reliance on exports.  (AFP/Xinhua)

 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 266.02 points, or 1.11 percent, to open at 24,226 points on Monday.
 <br>

  It comes as official data shows China's retail sales of consumer goods - a major indicator of the country's consumption strength - climbed 4 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also showed that China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 5.9 percent on-year in the same period. (Xinhua)

    'Action plan to stabilise stock, property markets'

<img alt="Central authorities have said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1796002_1_20250317095840.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland officials on Monday said a special action plan to boost consumption,will, for the first time, put an emphasis on the need to stabilise both the stock and property markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Xinhua News Agency said that the action plan – organised into eight sections – aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions and to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The plan puts an emphasis on stabilising the stock and property markets, and proposes corresponding measures in a bid to make people feel more confident about consuming, with more stable expectations,” a deputy director of the National Development and Reform Commission, Li Chunlin, told reporters at a press conference in Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said officials have sought to strengthen demand-side policies to stimulate consumption.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For example, the plan proposes to promote the reasonable growth of wages. This includes supporting enterprises to stabilise employment, and supporting workers to improve their skills.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[We want to] scientifically and reasonably raise the minimum wage, so that the minimum wage standard can be adjusted on time and in a steady manner."
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the plan, financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said, adding there are proposals to linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li also pointed out that the central government has doubled to 300 billion yuan the "ultra-long bonds" earmarked for subsidising the public's replacement of goods such as mobile electronic devices, electric cars and electronic home appliances.
  <br>
  <br>
  The State Council's plan also includes proposals to formulate a childcare subsidy scheme, implement paid annual leave for workers, boost healthcare protection for the elderly, along with other measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, official data showed on Monday that new home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February. On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a five percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the central government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year. China will also introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth.

    CK Hutchison ports deal questioned again

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Safe-haven gold surpassed US$3,000 for the first time on Friday, boosted by uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while stock markets gained on hopes US lawmakers will avert a government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Markets hate uncertainty, and Trump's second tenure in the White House has served to provide huge instability over expectations for trade, jobs, inflation, and government spending," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Asian equities managed to end the week on a positive note while European markets were also up in midday deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks gained support from "hopes that the US government would avoid a shutdown of non-essential services," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just hours until a deadline to push a Republican spending bill through, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package would keep the lights on through September, but Democrats have come under pressure from their grassroots to defy the plan, which they say is full of harmful spending cuts. (AFP)

    CK Hutchison shares down after port deal criticism

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday on a fresh wave of tariff threats by US President Donald Trump, and despite producer inflation remaining flat.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 percent to 40,813, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.4 percent to 5,521.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost nearly two percent to 17,303.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P drop means the index has tumbled into a correction, or down 10 percent from its highest point of the year, recorded just last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before trading began, Trump unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  His threat came after the EU announced a series of countermeasures against new US steel and aluminum tariffs, including a sharp hike targeting US whiskey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would make good on his threat if the bloc's planned whiskey levy "is not removed immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, government data also showed that the producer price index was flat in February, after a 0.6 percent rise in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's pretty good news in terms of inflation but the problem is, you have a trade war that's expanding," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  While recent inflation reports have been encouraging, Cardillo added that markets are wary as the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, alongside Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on the economy. (AFP)

    Intel hires Malaysian veteran to head reboot

<img alt="Tan Lip Bu rejoins Intel as chief executive on Tuesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795538_1_20250313134923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Tan Lip Bu as the latest in a succession of chief executives to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job on Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous head, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.
  <br>
  <br>
  This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down in August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lip Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” interim executive chairman Frank Yeary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60 percent, wiping out US$160 billion in shareholder wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees — about 15 percent of its workforce — and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of US$19 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvida now boasts a market value of US$2.8 trillion compared to Intel's US$90 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel's stock price rose more than 10 percent in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold. (AP)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose 0.07 percent at the starting of trading. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795517_1_20250313101303.jpg&q=75">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hang Seng Index gained 16.02 points, or 0.07 per cent, to open at 23,616.33 on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was down 0.02 percent at the opening at 3,371.09, while the Shenzhen Component Index opened 0.12 percent lower at 10,830.11.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight Wall Street stocks regained some ground helped by a rise in tech shares. A better-than-expected inflation report also assuaged investor concerns about the US economy and the direction of interest rates. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and AFP)
