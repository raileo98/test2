<div class="itemFullText">
 New home prices on the mainland dropped 0.1 percent in February, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  On a year-on-year basis, new home prices fell 4.8 percent, compared with a 5 percent drop the previous month.
  <br>
  <br>
  In its annual work report earlier this month, the government said arresting the protracted slide in the property market was among its major tasks this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  China will introduce city-specific policies for adjusting homebuying curbs and tap into the potential demand for first homes and better housing, policymakers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, the State Council unveiled what it called a "special action plan" to boost domestic consumption, featuring measures including increasing residents' income and establishing a childcare subsidy scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan, organised into eight sections, "aims to promote reasonable wage growth by strengthening employment support in response to economic conditions", Xinhua reported.
  <br>
  <br>
  It intends to grow incomes through property reform, including in rural areas where it calls for "exploring ways to unlock the values of houses legally owned by farmers", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mechanisms for stabilising the stock market and the development of financial products for individual investors are also being explored.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial institutions will be encouraged to issue more personal consumption loans and set reasonable loan limits, terms and interest rates, Xinhua said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also mentions linking consumer consumption to broader social goals, and potentially raising pension benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  China would also accelerate the development and application of new technologies and products including autonomous driving, smart wearables, and robotics, to create new high-growth consumption sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing is pushing for economic growth of around five percent this year, Premier Li Qiang announced at the opening session of the National People's Congress earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new plan is part of China's drive to make domestic demand the main engine and anchor of its economic growth. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing officials have shared a second article by the Ta Kung Pao newspaper criticising the sale by Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison of its Panama Canal ports – and dozens of other ports across the globe – to a US consortium.
 <br>
  <br>
  CK Hutchison – the flagship firm of Hong Kong's richest man Li Ka-shing – will reportedly make US$19 billion from the deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the article, Ta Kung Pao questioned why CK Hutchison would want to sell to the US, which it described as having ill intentions.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump has said he wants the US to take back control of the Panama Canal – and has not ruled out military force.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ta Kung Pao also asked whether the transaction had taken the interests of the nation into account, saying those who choose to dance with the Americans have no future even if they make big money.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the liaison office and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office shared an earlier article by Ta Kung Pao calling on CK Hutchison to rethink the deal.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday following bargain hunting that reduced the week's losses amid recession worries over President Trump's shifting tariff policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices opened higher and remained in positive territory through the day, shrugging off a downcast reading on US consumer sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to the diminished odds of a US government shutdown as supportive of stocks after Democratic Senate Leader Charles Schumer backed a spending bill favored by Republican President Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,638, up 2.1 percent for the day, but down 2.3 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.7 percent to 41,488, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.6 percent to 17,754.
  <br>
  <br>
  A consumer survey by the University of Michigan said expectations for the future "deteriorated," with "many consumers": citing a "high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors."
  <br>
  <br>
  The report came as economists warn that Trump's wide-ranging and unpredictable trade policy risks delaying investments, raising the odds of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major indices dropped more than one percent on Thursday after Trump threatened a 200 percent tariff on European Union wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages following the EU's announced countermeasures against new US steel and alumium tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Friday, all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posted gains, while the Dow index was mostly up. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Safe-haven gold surpassed US$3,000 for the first time on Friday, boosted by uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's tariffs, while stock markets gained on hopes US lawmakers will avert a government shutdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Markets hate uncertainty, and Trump's second tenure in the White House has served to provide huge instability over expectations for trade, jobs, inflation, and government spending," said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Asian equities managed to end the week on a positive note while European markets were also up in midday deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks gained support from "hopes that the US government would avoid a shutdown of non-essential services," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.
  <br>
  <br>
  With just hours until a deadline to push a Republican spending bill through, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer dropped his threat to block it.
  <br>
  <br>
  The package would keep the lights on through September, but Democrats have come under pressure from their grassroots to defy the plan, which they say is full of harmful spending cuts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of CK Hutchison shed more than 6 percent on Friday, after the Beijing office in charge of Hong Kong affairs reposted a newspaper commentary slamming the firm's sale of its Panama Canal ports.
 <br>
  <br>
  Last week, the conglomerate controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a consortium led by US asset management firm BlackRock.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal worth US$22.8 billion followed intense pressure from US President Donald Trump, who vowed to take back control of the canal, using force if necessary.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office shared on its website an opinion piece published by Ta Kung Pao on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary noted reports suggesting BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink had a "close relationship" with Trump, and described the deal as an act of American hegemony.
  <br>
  <br>
  For CK Hutchison, "Critics say this is an act of kneeling down... and one which disregards national interests, betrays and sells out Chinese people," the article read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The commentary also told the company to think twice and decide "which position and side it wants to be on".
  <br>
  <br>
  The article was also shared by Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Leung, an independent China strategist, told RTHK that while he understood why Beijing was upset with the deal, CK Hutchison had to act with its business interests in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[CK Hutchison] still has a great deal of businesses tied to mainland China and to Hong Kong. So I don't think that this is anything other than, if you like, a self-centered business strategy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Beijing is fully aware of [CK Hutchison's] importance to Hong Kong. But on the other hand, it has to balance its national interests and perceived threats from the Trump administration - a hostile Trump administration bent on scuttling China's rise - and also send a signal to other businesses tied to China to be more aware of these national strategic priorities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, snapped a five-day losing streak, climbing more than 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The index had surged past 24,000 before giving up some of the gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  It ended 497 points or 2.1 percent higher at 23,959.

 Wall Street stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday on a fresh wave of tariff threats by US President Donald Trump, and despite producer inflation remaining flat.
 <br>
  <br>
  At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3 percent to 40,813, while the broad-based S&P 500 Index fell 1.4 percent to 5,521.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost nearly two percent to 17,303.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P drop means the index has tumbled into a correction, or down 10 percent from its highest point of the year, recorded just last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before trading began, Trump unleashed the threat of a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  His threat came after the EU announced a series of countermeasures against new US steel and aluminum tariffs, including a sharp hike targeting US whiskey.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would make good on his threat if the bloc's planned whiskey levy "is not removed immediately."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, government data also showed that the producer price index was flat in February, after a 0.6 percent rise in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's pretty good news in terms of inflation but the problem is, you have a trade war that's expanding," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  While recent inflation reports have been encouraging, Cardillo added that markets are wary as the full effects of Trump's tariffs have yet to be seen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will be eyeing the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, alongside Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments on the economy. (AFP)

<img alt="Tan Lip Bu rejoins Intel as chief executive on Tuesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795538_1_20250313134923.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Struggling chipmaker Intel has hired former board member and semiconductor industry veteran Tan Lip Bu as the latest in a succession of chief executives to attempt to turn around a once-dominant company that helped define Silicon Valley.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tan, 65, will take over the daunting job on Tuesday, more than three months after Intel's previous head, Pat Gelsinger, abruptly retired amid a deepening downturn that triggered massive layoffs and raised questions about the chipmaker's ability to survive as an independent company.
  <br>
  <br>
  This won't be Tan's first time running a semiconductor company, nor his first association with Intel.
  <br>
  <br>
  He spent more than a decade as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which makes software that helps designs processors, and joined Intel's board of directors in 2022 before stepping down in August. Tan will rejoin Intel's board.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Lip Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” interim executive chairman Frank Yeary said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel has been led by interim co-CEOs, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, since Gelsinger walked away from a job that he undertook in February 2021.
  <br>
  <br>
  Although Gelsinger arrived at Intel amid high hopes, his tenure was a major letdown as Intel's stock price plunged 60 percent, wiping out US$160 billion in shareholder wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Leading up to his departure last year, Intel laid of 17,500 of its employees — about 15 percent of its workforce — and suspended its dividend to save money on its way to an annual loss of US$19 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvida now boasts a market value of US$2.8 trillion compared to Intel's US$90 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel's stock price rose more than 10 percent in Wednesday's extended trading after Tan's hiring was announced, indicating investors believe he will revive the company's fortunes.
  <br>
  <br>
  While Tan was Cadence Design's CEO from January 2009 to May 2021, the company's stock price increased by 44-fold. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the EU vowed on Wednesday to strike back and defend their economic interests against sweeping new US steel and aluminium tariffs, moving Washington closer to an all-out trade war with two major partners.
 <br>
  <br>
  The levies took effect just after midnight on Wednesday "with no exceptions or exemptions", as promised by the White House – despite countries' efforts to avert them.
  <br>
  <br>
  The European Commission said it would impose "a series of countermeasures" from April 1 in response to the "unjustified trade restrictions" from the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We deeply regret this measure," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, adding that "the countermeasures we take today are strong but proportionate".
  <br>
  <br>
  "As the US are applying tariffs worth US$28 billion, we are responding with countermeasures worth" the equivalent in euros, she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  And China, the world's leading steel manufacturer – though not a major exporter of the product to the United States – vowed "all necessary measures" in response.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are no winners in trade wars," foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington's tariffs would "seriously damage the rules-based multilateral trading system", she warned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has imposed steep tariffs on major US trading partners Canada, Mexico and China since returning to office, allowing only a partial rollback for his country's neighbours while vowing fresh levies from April 2. (AFP)

<img alt="The shifts came after the consumer price index came in at a cooler than expected 2.8 percent for February. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795496_1_20250313063349.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained some ground Wednesday helped by a rise in tech shares, as easing inflation assuaged some investor jitters about the world's biggest economy even as tariff worries lingered.
 <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index gained 0.5 percent to 5,599.30 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index surged 1.2 percent to 17,648.45.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 percent to 41,350.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shifts came after the consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of inflation, came in cooler than expected for February, the first full month that President Donald Trump was in office.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI was up 2.8 percent from a year ago, a touch lower than the 3.0 percent increase in January, according to Labor Department data.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding the volatile food and energy segments, "core" CPI was up 3.1 percent, also easing from before.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Karl Haeling of LBBW cautioned that the market rebound might have more to do with its "technical condition."
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tech stocks got hit the most, so they're the ones that are bouncing the most," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  US markets slumped early this week on fears that Trump's tariff policies might nudge the country's economy into a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  But tech stocks picked up Wednesday with Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Tesla logging notable gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  As for the health of the US economy, subsequent data reports will likely be more meaningful when it comes to reflecting the effects of tariffs, Haeling added.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, Trump's sweeping levies on steel and aluminium imports kicked in, marking the latest salvo in his broadening series of duties. (AFP)

    Cathay Pacific profits edge up

<img alt="Cathay Pacific's group net profit rose one percent to HK$9.89 billion last year. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795410_1_20250312142536.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific Airways on Wednesday reported marginal full-year profit growth as airfares fell amid intense competition at a time when Asia's airlines are continuing to get back to pre-pandemic seat capacity.
 <br>
  <br>
  The city’s flagship airline posted a one percent rise in its group net profit of HK$9.89 billion for the year ended December 31, supported by elevated cargo demand, more passengers, lower fuel prices and cost efficiencies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in the Hong Kong-listed airline jumped almost four percent to their highest since May 2019 just after the results were announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay Pacific's full-service airline, however, saw its annual yield, a proxy for airfares, fall 12 percent, while yields at the group's fully owned low-cost carrier HK Express fell 23 percent year on year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HK Express reported a full-year loss of HK$400 million compared to a profit of HK$433 million in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cathay attributed the drops at HK Express to intense competition on regional routes pushing airfares down and industry-wide issues with the Pratt & Whitney engines that power its Airbus A320neo planes, which grounded some aircraft in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A path to sustained profitability can be expected as [HK Express] continues to grow and increase its efficiencies," Cathay said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline's cargo yields, meanwhile, rose three percent year on year and the airline carried 11 percent more cargo tonnage, although Cathay warned that developing global trade conflicts could pose challenges to its freight business.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Given the global geopolitical situation, we are cautiously monitoring any short-term impacts on air cargo demand," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press conference, Cathay's chief customer and commercial officer,  Lavinia Lau, noted that shifts in global trade policies, such as de minimis changes, have increased uncertainties over the cargo market.
  <br>
  <br>
  She pointed out that the airline has contingency plans to handle unexpected changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have always built in flexibility in our business, meaning that if we see demand from a certain country or region having changes, we can always shift our network and flights to other parts of the world," she said. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Trump's 25 pct tariffs on steel and aluminium in force

<img alt="A new wave of US tariffs sees levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminium imports. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1795389_1_20250312121525.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect on Wednesday as prior exemptions, duty free quotas and product exclusions expired.
 <br>
  <br>
  His administration says the move is to reorder global trade norms in favour of America and its citizens.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's action to bulk up protections for American steel and aluminum producers restores effective global tariffs of 25 percent on all imports of the metals and extends the duties to hundreds of downstream products made from the metals, from nuts and bolts to bulldozer blades and soda cans.
  <br>
  <br>
  The runup to the tariff deadline came with some drama on Tuesday as Trump threatened Canada with doubling the duty to 50 percent on its steel and aluminum exports to America.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Trump backed off those plans after Ontario Premier Doug Ford agreed to suspend his province's decision to impose a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to the states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York until earlier US tariffs were removed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford said he would fly to Washington on Thursday with Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc for talks with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and other Trump officials to discuss revising the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The incident whip-sawed US financial markets already jittery over Trump's broad tariff offensive, but left unchanged Trump's original plans to strengthen the Section 232 national security tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed in 2018 during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  A White House spokesperson described the US pressure on Canada as a "win" for the American people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Customs and Border Protection agency cut off imports qualifying for duty-free entry under quota arrangements well before the midnight deadline, saying in a bulletin to shippers that quota paperwork needed to be processed by 4.30pm local time on Tuesday at US ports of entry or the full tariffs would be charged.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move was welcomed by US steel producers as restoring Trump's original 2018 metals tariffs that had been weakened by numerous country exclusions and quotas and thousands of product-specific exclusions.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By closing loopholes in the tariff that have been exploited for years, President Trump will again supercharge a steel industry that stands ready to rebuild America," Steel Manufacturers Association President Philip Bell said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The countries most affected by the tariffs are Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the US, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, which all have enjoyed some level of exemptions or quotas. (Reuters)

    Australia says US steel tariffs 'entirely unjustified'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Washington's looming tariffs on steel and aluminium are "entirely unjustified", Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Wednesday after failing to secure a last-minute exemption.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This is not a friendly act," Albanese told reporters, after the White House dashed hopes that Australia would be excluded from blanket 25 percent levies on steel and aluminium.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Quite clearly it is not a positive step in our relationship. It is as simple as that."
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's decision to slug close ally Australia was "entirely unjustified", Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is against the spirit of our two nations' enduring friendship. Friends need to act in a way that reinforces, to our respective populations, the fact that we are friends."
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the setback, Albanese said Australia would not retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tariffs and escalating trade tensions are a form of economic self-harm and a recipe for slower growth and higher inflation", he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Albanese hinted that Australia may be one of the few nations to secure an exemption following a phone call with Trump in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials told Australian media overnight that the exemption was no longer on the table.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He considered it, and considered against it," spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told national broadcaster ABC.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia is a minor global player in steel export markets but is a dominant source of iron ore, a key raw ingredient in the alloy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian steel producer BlueScope said it employed around 4,000 staff in the United States. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday on uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff threats, just one day after taking a dramatic plunge on the back of recession fears.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump reported late in the afternoon that he would "probably" reconsider doubling planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, just hours after announcing a sharp hike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Days of back-and-forth on tariff hikes against some of the United States' closest trading partners have worn heavily on markets, while Trump's weekend refusal to rule out the possibility of a recession sent Wall Street tumbling Monday, with the Nasdaq marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The volatility is nothing new to us over the course of the last three weeks," Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management told AFP, adding that it's "largely driven by the uncertainty around things like tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The difference today is, for the first time in three weeks, it appears as though we might be getting a little bit of good news, it appears as though there might be a window cracked open in the negotiations with Canada on tariffs," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.1 percent, bringing it to 41,433.48.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slid 0.8 percent to 5,572.07, while the tech-rich Nasdaq composite Index retreated 0.2 percent to 17,436.10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly the longer this uncertainty persists, the more investors are willing to take money off the table and de-risk their portfolios," Hogan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite its small drop, the tech-centric Nasdaq was bolstered by megacaps such as Tesla and Nvidia, which began to claw their way back following drastic plunges on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The electric car maker bounced 3.8 percent after Trump announced he was buying one of its vehicles.
  <br>
  <br>
  And AI chipmaker Nvidia was in positive territory Tuesday, climbing 1.7 percent after tumbling one day prior. (AFP)

 Hong Kong stocks ended flat on Tuesday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down one point to close at 23,782.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Japan's economy expanded in the October-December quarter at a slower pace than initially reported, government data showed on Tuesday, weighed by weaker consumption but still likely supporting the case for further interest rate hikes.
 <br>
  <br>
  Gross domestic product expanded an annualised 2.2 percent in the three months to December, the Cabinet Office's revised data showed, slower than the 2.8 percent growth in the initial estimate and economists' median forecast.
  <br>
  <br>
  The revised numbers translate into a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 0.6 percent in price-adjusted terms, compared with a 0.7 percent growth issued on February 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of Japan raised short-term interest rates in January to their highest in 17 years, and growth momentum in the world's fourth-largest economy will be among key factors determining how fast it continues to tighten policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The capital expenditure component of GDP, a barometer of private demand-led strength, rose 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, revised up from a 0.5 percent expansion in the initial estimate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of economic activity, was unchanged versus the preliminary reading of 0.1 percent uptick.
  <br>
  <br>
  External demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.7 of a percentage point to growth, unchanged from the preliminary reading. Domestic demand shaved 0.2 of a percentage point off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate data from the internal affairs ministry showed household spending rose 0.8 percent in January year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a seasonally adjusted, month-on-month basis, spending dropped 4.5 percent, bigger than an estimated 1.9 percent decline. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Monday as investors fretted that uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff policy could tip the world's biggest economy into a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The moves came after Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a 2025 recession, saying there would be "a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big -- we're bringing wealth back to America."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks led the slump, with the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index marking its largest one-day loss since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq plunged by 4.0 percent, bringing it to 17,468.32.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 Index retreated 2.7 percent to 5,614.56 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 2.1 percent to 41,911.71.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major tech names saw sharp losses, with Tesla shares diving 15.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others among the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks -- which include Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia -- also sank.
  <br>
  <br>
  While markets were previously bolstered by hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation, Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers noted that sentiment has been bogged down by more immediate worries over tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China -- even as he backed off some of the levies on his country's immediate neighbors.
  <br>
  <br>
  A new wave of tariffs threatens to hit this week, with steep levies of 25 percent on steel and aluminum due to take effect Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Ongoing confusion about tariffs and concerns that maybe the Doge cuts are excessive led to a drop in consumer sentiment, and are now leading to fears of a slowdown or higher inflation or both," Sosnick said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to sweeping cuts to the federal government overseen by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). (AFP)

 Local shares sank on Monday on a mixed day for equity markets, amid escalating global trade tensions.

  The Hang Seng Index slipped 1.85 percent to 23,783.

  <br>
  In a Fox News interview on Sunday, US President Donald Trump declined to predict whether his tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico would result in a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures sank and the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc strengthened early on Monday as deflationary pressures in China added to growth worries.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the mainland, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index was basically flat at the opening, rising 0.02 percent to 3,373.26 points. The Shenzhen Component Index also opened slightly higher, rising 0.18 percent to10,862.93 points. (with additional reporting from Xinhua and Reuters)

    7-Eleven explores sell-offs with Couche-Tard

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Japanese owner of 7-Eleven said on Monday it had agreed to jointly explore store sell-offs with Alimentation Couche-Tard (ACT) to address antitrust concerns ahead of a potential merger.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes just days after Seven & i - which has wholly-owned 7-Eleven, the world's biggest convenience store brand, since 2005 - announced a raft of new measures to fend off a takeover from its Canadian rival.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Joint outreach by financial advisors to ACT and 7&i to potential buyers has begun," Seven & i said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Couche-Tard has agreed to jointly "map out the viability of a divestiture process by defining operational, management, and financial characteristics of the group of stores to be sold and identifying potential buyers", it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This would provide some insight into the prospects of success along terms that had a reasonable likelihood of satisfying US antitrust regulators," Seven & i said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We and our advisors believe we can now make progress towards determining whether a credible and actionable remedy and divestiture package can be achieved that would allow a realistic assessment of ACT's proposal."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Thursday, the Tokyo-based company announced a huge share buyback and an IPO of its US unit - the latest twist in a saga that began last year, when Seven & i rebuffed a takeover offer worth nearly US$40 billion from ACT.
  <br>
  <br>
  When Seven & i rejected the initial takeover offer from ACT in September, the company said it had "grossly" undervalued its business and could face regulatory hurdles.
  <br>
  <br>
  Such a takeover would be the biggest foreign buyout of a Japanese firm, merging the 7-Eleven, Circle K and other franchises to create a global convenience store behemoth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seven & i, which operates some 85,000 convenience stores worldwide, also named Stephen Dacus as its first foreign CEO on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  ACT, which began with one store in Quebec in 1980, runs nearly 17,000 convenience store outlets worldwide, including Circle K. (AFP)

    Trump declines to rule out 2025 US recession

<img alt='President Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One "Who knows?", when asked on Sunday to clarify whether there could be a recession.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump declined on Sunday to rule out the possibility that the United States might enter a recession this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  "I hate to predict things like that," he told a Fox News interviewer when asked directly about a possible recession in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big - we're bringing wealth back to America," he said, adding, "It takes a little time."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, was more definitive when asked on Sunday about the possibility of a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Absolutely not," he told NBC's "Meet the Press" when asked whether Americans should brace for a downturn.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats against Canada, Mexico, China and others have left the US financial markets in turmoil and consumers unsure what the year might bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stock markets just ended their worst week since the November election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Measures of consumer confidence are down, as shoppers - already battered by years of inflation - brace for the higher prices that tariffs can bring.
  <br>
  <br>
  And widespread government lay-offs being engineered by Trump's billionaire advisor Elon Musk add further concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked later on Sunday to clarify his remarks on whether there could be a recession, Trump told reports on Air Force One "Who knows?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, the signs are mixed.
  <br>
  <br>
  A widely-watched Atlanta Federal Reserve index now predicts a 2.4 percent contraction of real GDP growth in the year's first quarter, which would be the worst result since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists at Goldman Sachs, citing Trump's policies, have raised their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15 percent to 20 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  And Morgan Stanley predicted "softer growth this year" than earlier expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Recessions are generally defined as two consecutive quarters of weak or negative GDP growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US was briefly in recession in early 2020 as the Covid pandemic spread. Millions of people lost jobs. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation in February fell at the quickest pace since January 2024, while producer price deflation persisted, as seasonal demand faded while households are still cautious about spending.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index edged down 0.7 percent last month from a year earlier, reversing January's 0.5 percent increase, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the first contraction in the index since January 2024, and worse than a 0.5 percent slide estimated by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.2 percent month-on-month, against a 0.7 percent rise in January and below a predicted 0.1 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index fell 2.2 percent on year in February, improving from a 2.3 percent slide in January, but missing the forecast 2.1 percent decline. (Reuters)

    US stocks end higher after Powell remarks

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished higher on Friday after a roller-coaster session following mixed labor market data, concluding a losing week on a positive note.
 <br>
  <br>
  Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare said investors were reassured by a midday appearance from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who described the central bank is in no hurry to shift course on monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When Powell came out with a calm and reassuring tone, it gave the market an excuse to rally," O'Hare said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,770, up 0.6 percent for the day but down 3.1 percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 percent at 42,801, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.7 percent to 18,196.
  <br>
  <br>
  US jobs data for February showed the country's economy added 151,000 jobs last month, up from January's revised 125,000 figure, but fewer than analysts estimates as unemployment ticked higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts described the report as unspectacular but good enough to suggest the labor market is not weakening precipitously.
  <br>
  <br>
  But O'Hare said investors are readjusting their views of the coming period in light of other disappointing economic reports.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is rethinking its growth outlook," he said. "Some of that is the tariffs. Some of that is the work around 'Doge'. Some of it is in the data itself."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Costco slumped 6.1 percent following disappointing earnings that sparked unease about the wholesaler's exposure to tariffs. Walmart also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Broadcom surged 8.6 percent after strong results boosted enthusiasm about the company's work in artificial intelligence. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's export growth grew slower than expected in the first two months of this year while imports fell sharply, amid escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to customs data released on Friday, outbound shipments from China in January and February rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with a gain of 10.7 percent in December and market expectations of a 5 percent increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slower pace was attributed partly to firms rushing out exports before the anticipated US tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imports declined 8.4 percent year on year, after rising by 1 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the drop in imports of grain, iron ore and crude oil signalled that Beijing was scaling back on purchases of key commodities amid heightened tensions with the United States under  the Trump administration.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus for the two months came in at US$170 billion. (Agencies)

    Golden era for low-altitude economy: CPPCC delegates

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has ushered in a golden era to develop the so-called "low altitude" economy, or even a "sky city", according to delegates at the country's top political advisory body.
 <br>
  <br>
  It comes as the annual "Two Sessions" continues in Beijing, featuring delegates at the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Yang Yi, a CPPCC delegate, who is also a senior technical expert at the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, said the low-altitude economy is one example of "new quality productive forces", as it has vast potential to open up a new industry while reshaping the current sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China has ushered in the golden period of developing the low-altitude economy, it is now the industry's 'take-off' period, and the low-altitude economy will become a new engine of China's economic growth, to spark new consumption trends," she told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The idea of building a city in the sky will no longer be simply a dream," she added, noting this year's key tasks include gradually opening up the nation's aerial space, enhancing regulatory frameworks and safety, continuing technological innovation, while encouraging market engagement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Xu Xiaolan, a vice chairperson of the standing committee of the CPPCC National Committee, who is also the vice chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, said the country's internet-based industrial production had expanded to cover 49 economic fields, involving some 1.53 trillion yuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xu, a computer scientist, who is also the former vice minister of the Industry and Information Technology of China, added the latest breakthroughs achieved by DeepSeek have also been applied to various sectors including the search engines, text generating, medicine, culture, and tourism.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks resumed their retreat on Thursday, falling hard ahead of key US jobs data as markets shrugged off President Trump's latest moves to soften tariff actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday unveiled a temporary rollback to steep tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico, but the shift was not enough to spark a change in stock market activity.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down one percent at 42.579, after spending the entire session in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 slumped 1.8 percent to 5,738, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index sank 2.6 percent to 18,069.
  <br>

  Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management said the uncertainty around trade policy is "affecting the real economy," dragging down consumer sentiment and business investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The longer that goes on, the more the economy slows," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again to boost the struggling eurozone, but suggested the easing could be nearing an end and warned of "rising uncertainty" amid massive German spending plans and US tariff threats.

  <br>
  Large tech firms were among the bigger losers Thursday, including Netflix, down 8.5 percent, Tesla, down 5.6 percent and Nvidia, down 5.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are looking ahead to Friday's jobs report for February. Weekly jobless claims figures released on Thursday were better than expected, while Wednesday's private payroll report from ADP lagged estimates. (AFP)

<img alt="Only 4.5 percent of private flats were vacant as of end-2024, the government says. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794626_1_20250306222204.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities insist there is still keen demand for housing, citing a low vacancy rate for private flats, in response to a market report suggesting the city's home market is on the decline due to a supply glut.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement on Thursday, an SAR government spokesman added delinquent residential mortgages remained at an extremely low level, and that banks are mitigating their credit risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  The comments were in response to an S&P report on Hong Kong's banks and property market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We disagree with the observation that there is an oversupply of residential properties," the spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of the end of last year, the vacancy rate for private homes stood at 4.5 percent, in line with the average between 2004 and 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Rents also keep going up, reflecting keen housing demand."
  <br>
  <br>
  As for delinquent residential mortgages, only 0.12 percent of all loans drawn were overdue as of end-January.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under the Monetary Authority's counter-cyclical measures, the city's average residential mortgage rate remained solid at 60 percent, while the debt-servicing ratio, at 40 percent, was also low," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman added it agreed with the report's view that Hong Kong's banking sector can withstand "strains arising from the commercial real estate" sector, saying loans are diversified and institutions have taken measures to mitigate risks.

<img alt="The MTR Corporation posts a net profit of HK$15.77 billion for 2024. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794580_1_20250306173403.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Net profit at the MTR Corporation more than doubled last year, thanks largely to strong gains in local property development.
 <br>
  <br>
  The railway firm posted a full-year profit of HK$15.77 billion, up from HK$7.78 billion in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total revenue rose 5.3 percent to HK$60 billion, compared with HK$56 billion the year before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Local property development fared especially well, with net profit up nearly four times to HK$10.26 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were mainly due to earnings from sites at LOHAS Park, Ho Man Tin Station and The Southside in Wong Chuk Hang, the MTR said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added it is considering possible tenders of Package 2 of Tung Chung East Station and Tuen Mun A16 Station Package 1 in the coming 12 months, but noted that any decisions will depend on market conditions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses in its mainland property business, meanwhile, narrowed to HK$3 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also said patronage continued to recover, with passenger numbers of its domestic operations reaching 1.95 billion in 2024, close to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ridership rose for the high-speed rail link as well, with more than 26.7 million journeys recorded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the MTR's annual results, Jacob Kam, the group's chief executive officer, noted that last year's performance was boosted by the notable recovery in property development under the "Rail plus Property" business model.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the company’s operating results were satisfactory during the year under review, it is important to reiterate that much of these profits will be committed to the substantial funding required for the upgrading and renewal of existing lines as well as planning and constructing new railway projects," he said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We also must keep adapting to the new realities of consumer behaviour in the post-pandemic era, particularly the established trends of Hong Kong people travelling north for weekends and holidays and mainland Chinese tourists spending less time in local retail outlets."
  <br>
  <br>
  The company declared a final dividend of HK$0.89 per share, raising the full-year total to HK$1.31.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said he's confident that the 5 percent GDP growth target set by China for 2025 can be met, despite external headwinds and weak domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br>
  "From a holistic approach, we have advantage in our system, potential in our market, and vitality in our businesses," Zheng Shanjie told reporters in a press conference in Beijing on the sidelines of the ongoing "Two Sessions".
  <br>
  <br>
  "And most importantly, we have the courage to face up to these risks and challenges and confidence to address these issues. It is fair to say that the realisation of this year's growth target is well supported."
  <br>
  <br>
  Zheng said there's uncertainty in the external environment and problems such as insufficient domestic demand, but believes they can be overcome.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Beijing will launch major projects in railways, nuclear power and other infrastructure to attract private investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, said authorities will cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratios for financial institutions at an appropriate time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to keep abreast with domestic and external economic and financial situations and the financial market operation, and make reasonable cuts to the [reserve requirement ratio] and interest rate at a proper time," he told reporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pan also said the central bank will roll out more supportive monetary policies and prevent the risk of its exchange rate overshooting.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that officials will expand a special relending facility from 500 billion to 800 billion yuan to support tech industries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said there is ample room for fiscal policies to respond to domestic and global challenges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He promised to further expand fiscal spending this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make full use of the policy space and draft more incremental policy focusing on livelihood, consumption and future growth drivers, and ensure policy consistencies so as to carry out stronger and more precise policy to benefit all," Lan said.

 Hong Kong stocks rose on Thursday following a jump on Wall Street, after the Trump administration delayed auto tariffs on Canada and Mexico.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index rose 392 points, or 1.67 percent, to open at 23,987 points.

    Wall Street rebounds after Trump pauses auto tariffs

<img alt='White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the US President decided to "give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA", a North American free trade pact. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794487_1_20250306084640.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks climbed on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled back on some of his tariffs temporarily.
 <br>
  <br>
  The move revived hope on Wall Street that Trump may avoid a worst-case trade war that grinds down economies and sends inflation higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent to 5,842, to bounce back from a sell-off that had erased all of its 'Trump bump' since Election Day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 percent to end at 43,006, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.5 percent to 18,552.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market turned sharply higher after Trump said he was granting a one-month exemption for US automakers on his stiff new tariffs for Mexican and Canadian imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump made the move after talking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler.
  <br>
  <br>
  All of the Big Three automakers could have been hurt by such tariffs because of how much production happens across the countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump’s announcement sent relief through Wall Street, and Ford’s and General Motors’ stock both jumped more than 5 percent to help lead a widespread rally across the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The worry has been that such tariffs would not only hurt profits for companies but also jack up prices for cars and other bills for US households already struggling with still-high inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  A couple reports on Wednesday gave a mixed read on the US economy. One suggested US employers pulled back sharply on their hiring last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The report from payrolls processing firm, ADP, could be a warning signal ahead of the more comprehensive jobs report that’s coming Friday from the US Labor Department.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate report said growth for US finance, real estate and other businesses in the services sector is better than economists expected. But businesses also said in the survey they’re confronting “chaos” and uncertainty because of tariffs, according to the Institute for Supply Management. (AP)

<img alt="Zhou Yunjie, chairman of home appliances firm Haier, says technological innovation is a key factor to enable enterprises become international brands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese companies are doubling down on innovation as part of efforts to contribute to the national drive of developing "new quality productive forces", with leaders convening in Beijing for the annual Two Sessions meetings.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a press event in the capital, Lei Jun, the chairman of Xiaomi, which was originally a smartphone maker but has entered the electric vehicle (EV) space, said technological innovation aided his firm's meteoric rise in recent years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investment in technological innovation reached 105 billion yuan over the past five years, which helped Xiaomi to become the world's third largest smartphone maker, selling some 170 million mobile phones last year, Lei said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of its internet-based smart home devices, meanwhile, also fared well, with some 900 million such items being sold, demonstrating the popularity of Chinese tech products around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lei, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said Xiaomi would continue to invest in technological research and innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Manufacturing is the foundation of China and the foundation of a strong country. Xiaomi, as a builder and beneficiary of the manufacturing industry, will continue to adhere to the path of striving for scientific and technological innovation as well as high-end development, ramp up the cultivation of new quality productive forces, apply the latest artificial intelligence technology to all our terminals, to let all consumers experience the wonderful life brought by technologies, and at the same time, contribute our efforts to the development of the Chinese-style modernisation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also expressed confidence in the country's private sector, after attending a high-profile meeting with President Xi Jinping last month which indicated stronger support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Echoing Lei, Zhou Yunjie, chairman of Chinese home appliances firm Haier, who is also an NPC deputy, said that technology helped boost the company's global ambitions.
  <br>

  "Scientific and technological innovation is a key factor for a brand whether it could stand strong in the world. If an enterprise aims to go global, it has to stick to technological innovation as its solid base, to keep on innovating - until it reaches the top, so that the brand could truly be a top leader. Haier has also been adhering to such a principle, we kept looking up to international standards until we reached breakthroughs," he said.

  <br>
  Zhou added that artificial intelligence was a new opportunity for China and that more Chinese firms would be able to create internationally recognised brands.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday said the nation will vigorously boost consumption and investment, with domestic demand becoming "the main engine and anchor of economic growth" as stated in his government work report.
 <br>
  <br>
  Among the measures outlined is the issuance of 300 billion yuan of ultra-long treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programmes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li said Beijing will adopt special measures to boost spending power, increase the supply of quality products and services, and improve the consumption environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will create a full range of new consumption scenarios to advance the growth of digital, green, smart, and other types of consumption. We will also introduce measures to unleash the consumption potential in culture and sports-related industries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The premier also said Beijing will expand effective investment and create greater synergy between fiscal and financial policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will implement new mechanisms for public-private partnership in a well-regulated manner and guide more private investment toward major infrastructure and public well-being projects, thus creating more opportunities for the development of private capital," the report said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Li added that 735 billion yuan will be earmarked in the central government's budget for investment this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, observers believe government policies will not only lead to sustained growth this year but also lay the groundwork for the modernisation drive in the long run, as the country embarks on its next Five-Year Plan from 2026.

 US stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq veering near correction territory, as trade tensions escalated following US President Donald Trump's new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with doubled duties on Chinese goods, took effect on Tuesday.
  <br>

    CK Hutchison to sell Panama unit after Trump pressure

<img alt="The sale to a BlackRock consortium will deliver cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion to Hong Kong's CK Hutchison. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794251_1_20250305042524.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's CK Hutchison on Tuesday agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, following intense pressure from US President Donald Trump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US$22.8 billion sale, which also includes dozens of ports in other countries, appeared to be a win for Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the US Congress. Trump had refused to rule out military action to assert US control over the canal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has complained about the presence of mainland Chinese and Hong Kong-based companies in Panama, while US officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison's control of ports at both entrances of the canal represents a security risk for the operation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of licenses will result in the consortium gaining a 90 percent stake in Panama Ports Company, which has been the operator of the Balboa and Cristobal ports in the Central American country for more than two decades, CK Hutchison said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock has briefed the White House and Congressional leadership on the deal, a person familiar with the transaction said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This would be BlackRock's largest infrastructure investment to date, that person said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US State Department, White House, National Security Council and Panama's government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The canal is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama's authorities have announced an audit of CK Hutchison's contract, saying they are investigating its compliance with concession agreements. Panama's attorney general determined earlier this month that CK Hutchison's port contract was "unconstitutional." The Supreme Court was to have had the last word on its legal status.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio made his first overseas trip as top US diplomat to Latin America last month, including to Panama, where he pressured the country over China's presence along the canal. After his departure, Rubio hailed Panama's decision to exit China's Belt and Road infrastructure plan, and he has expressed optimism in media interviews that Hutchison would not own the ports in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale of Panama ports licenses held by the unit of billionaire Li Ka-shing's conglomerate to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment will give it control of an 80 percent interest in Hutchison Ports for an equity value of US$14.21 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  It will get control of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries while delivering cash proceeds in excess of US$19 billion for the Hong Kong-based consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  The sale does not involve any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, as well as South China, or any other ports in mainland China, CK Hutchison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for a period of 145 days, the company said.
  <br>
  <br>
  BlackRock completed the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for approximately US$12.5 billion in cash and stock last October. At the time, chairman and CEO Larry Fink described infrastructure as “a generational investment opportunity.” (Reuters)

 Canada will slap tariffs on US imports beginning on Tuesday in response to levies pledged by President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday, adding "there is no justification" for Washington's actions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12.01am EST tomorrow, respond with 25 percent tariffs against US$155 billion of American goods," the Canadian prime minister said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Steep US tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods came into effect Tuesday as a deadline to avert President Donald Trump's levies passed without the North American neighbours striking a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian goods will face a 25 percent tariff -- with energy resources hit by a lower 10 percent rate -- while Mexican products face a 25 percent blanket levy, according to orders Trump previously signed.
  <br>
  <br>
  He cited a lack of progress in tackling drug trafficking as he pushed ahead with the duties. (AFP)

    China's economy solid amid challenges: NPC spokesman

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s economy has a solid foundation with new growth drivers despite facing some challenges in the coming year, a spokesman for the top legislature said on Tuesday, as dates for the parliament’s annual session were announced.
 <br>
  <br>
  The annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC) will kick off on Wednesday and run until March 11, lasting for seven days.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the session, Beijing is expected to announce its economic growth target for 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Undoubtedly, the adverse impacts brought the external environment have deepened and China’s economy still faces some difficulties and challenges,” Lou Qinjian said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “But it’s more important to note that China’s economy has a solid foundation, many advantages, strong resilience and vast potential.”
  <br>
  <br>
  With the United States doubling additional tariffs on Chinese imports, the spokesman said trade disputes should be settled within the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
  <br>
  <br>
  “By imposing unilateral tariffs, the US has violated WTO rules and disrupted the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains,” Lou said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We hope the US can work in the same direction as China and find a solution through equal-footed consultation. China is also ready to work more closely with other countries to safeguard the hard-earned multilateral trading system, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and advance a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalisation.”
  <br>
  <br>
  The spokesman said the progress of DeepSeek reflects the rise of Chinese companies in artificial intelligence, saying such firms have become the backbone of the country’s science and technology development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lou said while artificial intelligence technologies are accompanied by “unknown risks”, China attaches great importance to their development.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday swiftly retaliated against fresh US tariffs, announcing a range of between 10 and 15 percent hikes to import levies covering a basket of American agricultural and food products, while placing 25 US firms under export and investment restrictions.
 <br>
  <br>
  "An additional 15 percent tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton," the Finance Ministry said, adding "additional 10 percent tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products."
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US's unilateral tariffs measures seriously violate World Trade Organisation rules and undermine the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US," the Commerce Ministry said in a separate statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," the statement added.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's new 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20 percent, launching new trade conflicts with the top three US trading partners. (Reuters)

 Stock markets in Hong Kong and on the mainland both opened lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the upcoming annual parliamentary sessions to gauge Beijing's policy path.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index lost 328.02 points, or 1.43 per cent, to open at 22,678 points on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Tech Index was down over three per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's blue-chip CSI300 Index dropped 0.6 per cent at the open, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market focus is shifting from the recent tech and AI themes to the National People's Congress meeting on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing was expected to maintain its economic growth target at roughly five per cent and announce a budget deficit of four per cent of GDP.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, Japan's Nikkei share average fell more than one per cent in early trade, dragged by overnight Wall Street declines and a stronger yen, with US tariffs on Canada and Mexico to take effect as planned later in the day.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump also reaffirmed that he will increase tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20 per cent from the previous 10 per cent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  After Trump's announcement, Beijing warned on Tuesday that it would take countermeasures against new US tariffs on Chinese imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the yen appreciated against the US dollar as the greenback slid, knocking down exporters shares and further dragging investor sentiment. (Agencies)

 US stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, after US President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions against China and levies on Mexico and Canada neared imposition, while European defence shares soared as the European Union sought increased military spending over Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br>
  The White House said Trump had signed an executive order raising tariffs on China to 20 per cent, shortly after Trump seemed to rule out any change to the planned 25 per cent tariffs against Mexico and Canada.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.5 per cent, while the broad-based S&P lost 1.8 per cent, and the tech-rich Nasdaq took a harsher tumble, closing down 2.6 per cent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX - colloquially known as Wall Street's "fear gauge" - surged, hitting its highest level since December.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, BAE Systems surged 14 per cent, helping London's benchmark FTSE 100 index to a record high, the latest in a series over recent months.
  <br>
  <br>
  French defence group Thales won more than 16 per cent and German peer Rheinmetall rallied 15 per cent. (AFP)

 US President Donald Trump has signed an order to hike tariffs on Chinese imports further, the White House said Monday, citing what it called Beijing's failure to tackle the illicit fentanyl trade.

  The order raises a previously imposed 10 percent tariff on China to 20 percent, as Trump promised, according to a White House social media post. (AFP)

<img alt="Hong Kong's retail sales dropped for the 11th consecutive month. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1794002_1_20250303165314.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's retail sales dropped 3.2 percent in January year-on-year, marking the 11th consecutive month of declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  According to official data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Monday, the value of total retail sales in January was estimated at HK$35.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  January's drop was narrower than the revised 9.6 percent decline recorded in December last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the sharpest decline at 52.6 percent, while those of furniture and fixtures saw a 26.4 percent fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, a department spokesman said looking at both January and February data would give a better picture of the city's retail performance during the Lunar New Year period.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, the near-term performance of the retail sector would continue to be affected by the change in consumption patterns of visitors and residents," the department statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bond Law, executive director of the Retail Management Association, said he expects a sluggish year for the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By April, we anticipate that the drop may narrow or level off with slight increases during certain holidays. Overall, we expect a flat year with fluctuations of no more than 2 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Law said purchasing power and consumer sentiment remained weak despite an increase in mainland travellers.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said while Hong Kong's capital account, which is used to finance large infrastructure projects such as the Northern Metropolis, was facing higher deficits, the city's operating account was still largely balanced.
 <br>
  <br>
  "On the operating account, our aim is to return it to balance as soon as possible, and start to register surplus. The coming [financial] year, in 2025-2026, we will be largely in balance. The deficit is only about HK$4 billion. When you take it into the context of the government expenditure of over HK$600 billion a year, I would call that largely balanced. And then the year after, 2026-2027, we [will] start to have an operating surplus," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added the city must expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis so as to drive the SAR's technological growth, but that would also mean the government's capital account would be under an imbalanced fiscal situation in the short term due to the gap between revenue and expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to match the cash flow requirements, we can consider issuing some bonds with longer tenor. That is possible. But at the same time, I have to wait and balance between cost of borrowing and the tenor," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been concerns over the city's rising debt, given authorities' plan to issue up to HK$195 billion worth of bonds annually over the coming five years.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Chan stressed the city's debt levels remain low and it should make good use of its borrowing capacity to meet the capital account cash flow gap.

<img alt="The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1793951_1_20250303101834.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity grew at a faster pace in February, driven by stronger supply and demand, a private-sector survey showed on Monday, partly due to seasonal factors related to the holiday period.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February from 50.1 the previous month, marking a three-month high. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI offers a snapshot of operating conditions in the manufacturing sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The positive trend in the Caixin survey aligned with an official PMI released over the weekend that showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest pace in three months.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The holiday period saw robust consumption momentum, and technological innovations in certain industries added to the positive sentiment, helping sustain the manufacturing market recovery," said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Factory production accelerated in February from the previous month, while total new orders increased at the quickest pace in three months. New export orders increased at their fastest pace since April last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, manufacturers faced rising input costs, particularly for materials like copper and various chemicals, putting pressure on profit margins.
  <br>
  <br>
  To mitigate these challenges, factory owners focused on cost-cutting. Employment in the sector continued to decline, and output prices remained subdued, reflecting weak pricing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite these pressures, business sentiment improved from January, buoyed by signs of recovering domestic demand and expectations of additional government support for the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's GDP grew five percent last year, reaching the official target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump on Thursday said he would slap an extra 10 percent duty on Chinese goods on March 4, on top of the 10 percent tariff that he levied on February 4, worsening the trade outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang emphasised the importance of timely policy support, saying "March represents a critical policy window. Supportive measures should address market expectations and societal concerns, focusing on key economic bottlenecks." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's largest bubble tea and drinks chain Mixue Group jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday after the firm raised HK$444 million in an initial public offering (IPO).
 <br>
  <br>
  Mixue sold 17 million shares in the deal at a fixed price of HK$202.50 each.
  <br>
  <br>
  The shares started trading at HK$262 each and the gains outpaced a 0.8 percent rise in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail investors subscribed for 5,258 times more shares than were on offer in that tranche, according to Mixue's filings, making it one of Hong Kong's most popular ever IPOs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail subscription rate was just below Bloks Group whose retail book was 6,000 times oversubscribed, a record, in its January IPO.
  <br>
  <br>
  The institutional tranche of the deal was 35 times covered, the filings showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mixue is often seen as China's largest chain of iced drinks, milk tea and ice cream. However, it operates more like a raw-material supplier than a traditional beverage brand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1997 as a small ice shop in Zhengzhou, Henan province, Mixue has grown into a franchise giant with over 45,000 stores globally by September 2024, surpassing Starbucks' 40,576 stores worldwide. (Reuters)

 Asian share markets dithered on Monday as the threat of imminent tariffs lurked in the background, while bitcoin surged on news it would be included in a new US strategic reserve of cryptocurrencies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump on social media announced five digital assets he expected to include in a new reserve, including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, shot up more than 11 percent to US$94,110, while ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, climbed 14 percent to US$2,528.

  <br>
  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, though Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent, helped by a softer yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both up 0.1 percent, having staged a late rally on Friday after a week of heavy losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect on Tuesday, but that Trump would determine whether to stick with the planned 25 percent level.
  <br>
  <br>
  An extra 10 percent levy on Chinese imports is also due to come into effect this week, just as the National People's Congress opens its annual session on Wednesday. (Reuters)
