<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.

  The world's second-largest economy is bracing for a possible new round of tariffs from a second Donald Trump White House while dealing with other headwinds, suggesting more policy stimulus could be needed to shore up growth. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq and the S&P hit fresh records on Friday after the November US jobs report came in better than expected, with the Dow edging down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, up from a revised 36,000 in October, according to the Department of Labor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of being viewed as a Goldilocks jobs print," Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jobs market is cooling, there's no question about that, but it's still relatively healthy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower, shedding 0.3 percent to close at 44,642.52.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P rose 0.3 percent to close at a new record of 6,090.27, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 percent to finish at a fresh high of 19,859.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a good day for tech titans, with Amazon and Facebook owner Meta closing up 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  UnitedHealthcare's shares fell 5.1 percent after the markets digested the news that its chief executive had been killed in a shooting in New York in the early hours of Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Bitcoin broke US$100,000 for the first time as traders cheered Donald Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782207_1_20241205124359.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin topped the US$100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president rolls on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes just hours after the president-elect signalled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry with his choice of Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to nominate Atkins, a former SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from US$69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as US$101,512 Wednesday, just two years after dropping below US$17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long bitcoin will stay above the coveted US$100,000 mark is uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday, extending a post-election rally on optimism about more interest rate cuts and an artificial intelligence boom after strong Salesforce results.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices scored records, led by the Dow Jones, which finished above 45,000 for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market at this point is looking for excuses to go up, and there's not really anything that might work against that narrative," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last couple of days, it's managed to ignore all sorts of inconvenient things," Sosnick said of the market's shrugging response to political upheaval in France and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 45,014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, its fourth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.3 percent to 19,735, its third straight record.

  Wednesday's gains came after payroll firm ADP said US private-sector hiring in November came in at a lower-than-expected 146,000 jobs, while a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed weaker sentiment than expected in the services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the lacklustre data boosts expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a New York conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained from tipping his hand, but he "didn't say anything that would scare the market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare noted that Wednesday's gains were led by large tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft, which are major AI players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boost followed strong results from Salesforce, which was the biggest gainer in the Dow with an 11 percent jump. (AFP)

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Seoul stock exchange fell 2 percent at the opening on Wednesday before limiting its losses in early trading, after President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared then lifted martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kospi composite index tumbled to 2,450 points as trading opened while shares in the country's biggest company Samsung Electronics slid 3 percent before paring losses about half an hour later to 1.12 percent down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean won lost 2.5 percent against the greenback overnight to 1,444.09 against the dollar, its weakest level in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It later regained ground at the start of Asian trading, ahead of an extraordinary meeting called by the South Korean central bank to "discuss the situation related to the declaration of martial law and market stabilisation measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 0030 GMT, it was trading at 1,414.49 won against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's stocks started the day cautiously, with blue-chip Nikkei down 0.11 percent to 39,205 points at the open. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh records with narrow gains on Tuesday as markets reacted to mixed labour market data that kept alive the possibility of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices have been notching regular records following the US presidential election, spawning talk that markets are now overvalued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not a whole lot of natural drivers of new money coming into the market at this point," said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners, adding that markets appear "biased to the upside" in light of a benign 2025 financial outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.2 percent at 44,705.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 6,049, a third straight record, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 19,480, scoring its second straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October, but also a decline in new job postings during the month, a less upbeat sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data overall provides "good grounds" for the Fed to lower interest rates again this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets lifted the odds of another rate cut by the US central bank on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, AT&T jumped 4.6 percent as it announced US$40 billion in shareholder give-backs at an investor day where it projected revenue and operating earnings growth over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  United States Steel sank 8.0 percent after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated a pledge to block a takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla dropped 1.6 percent after a US judge upheld her decision to reject Elon Musk's massive US$55.8 billion compensation package, concluding the electric car company's shareholder vote to reinstate the plan did not override her initial ruling. (AFP)

    South Korean currency drops after martial law declared

<img alt="Policemen stand in front of the gate to the National Assembly after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781957_1_20241203231014.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean won dropped to a more than two-year low against the US dollar on Tuesday, while exchange traded funds linked to South Korean stocks fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unannounced late-night address live on YTN television.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean unit fell to as low as 1,430.82 won per dollar, the lowest since October 2022. It was last down 1.9 percent at 1,430.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's uncertainty driven.. one of those 'shoot first, ask questions later' (moves)," said Christopher Wong, FX and rates strategist at OCBC in Singapore. "Given the lack of information, the uncertainty may still keep Korean won under pressure in the interim."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken the parliamentary process hostage to throw the country into a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks listed overseas swooned. The MSCI South Korea ETF fell 4.5 percent, while the Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF slid 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With losses of more than 9 percent so far this year, the won is one of Asia's worst performers and has been persistently under pressure as the Bank of Korea cut rates aggressively to support the economy and as investors fled a market they see as exposed heavily to exports and to US trade tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Korean won is already under pressure from the looming threat of tariffs and their detrimental impact on export-driven economies," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This latest development is likely to exacerbate the currency’s weakness, encouraging speculators to use the won as a high-beta proxy for expressing tariff-related risks." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a strong day on Monday, the first trading day in December, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closing at fresh record highs, and the Dow dipping slightly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major Wall Street index to fall on Monday, dipping 0.3 percent to close at 44,782.00.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to close at a new record of 6,047.15, while the Nasdaq rose 1.0 percent to an all-time high of 19,403.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a technical standpoint, the market is still in very good shape," Jack Ablin from Cresset Capital told AFP. "And December also coincides with... a favourable seasonal trend as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're just getting back to a mega cap growth stocks again," Ablin said. "And it may be because investors don't expect rates to come down as quickly as they originally thought."

  Ablin said the market was favouring those companies because they have "no debt or very little debt."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And so when they think rates are going to stay high, then they want the companies that aren't borrowing much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Super Micro Computer surged 28.7 percent after a probe into an auditor's concerns about governance and transparency issues found "no evidence" of misconduct at the firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another firm to rise was chip manufacturing equipment firm Applied Materials, which saw its share price rise by 4.9 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The local stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.65 percent to close at 19,550.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts said the gains were driven by encouraging manufacturing data and expectations of continued policy support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentiment was buoyed by data that showed China's factory activity expanded last month, with Beijing's stimulus blitz since September starting to trickle through.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 percent that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, a US$2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices," Sri Lanka's central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 percent in October and 0.5 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected in September, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending. (AFP)

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<img alt="Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781508_1_20241130110608.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended a holiday-shortened session higher as the US Black Friday shopping spree gathered steam and traders speculated whether President-elect Donald Trump may back off from his threatened tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The yen rallied against the US dollar as higher inflation in Japan fueled expectations that the central bank will hike interest rates again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are closing out a rollercoaster month for assets caused largely by Trump winning a second US presidential election -- and also a result of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are tracking developments surrounding Trump's pledge to hammer China, Canada and Mexico with hefty tariffs on his first day in office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock markets closed higher on a shortened trading day, with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting fresh records following Thursday's Thanksgiving break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 44,910.65, the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 percent at 6,032.38 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 19,218.17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip companies notched gains after a news report that President Joe Biden's administration was mulling further curbs on semiconductor equipment sales to China that were less severe than anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Nvidia closed 2.2 percent up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be "cruising along here without any interference," said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets closed higher, and London finished with more modest gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With many US investors still out after being off for Thanksgiving yesterday, the key theme that has emerged in the last few days is the easing of tariff fears," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who afterwards said: "There will not be a potential tariff war."
  <br>
  <br>
  The focus was also on shoppers seeking bargains on Black Friday, a crucial day for retailers around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare said Black Friday has become less of a "frenetic rush" given the popularity of online shopping now -- although there is still a lot of attention on the retail space. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

    Analyst sees slight growth in home prices in 2025

<img alt="A property analyst says the supply of new flats will peak next year, which will provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers. Photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781176_2_20241128105247.jpg&q=40">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday, retreating from records after pricing data showed an uptick in inflation, as leading companies fell after earnings reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  After three straight closing records for the Dow and Tuesday's record for the S&P 500, both dropped along with the Nasdaq in the final full trading session of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.3 percent at 44,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 5,998, while the Nasdaq shed 0.6 percent to 19,060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Wednesday's lacklustre session, investors are optimistic about the upcoming period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A note from CFRA Research pointed out that December has historically been the strongest month of the year for the S&P 500 since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We project additional new highs through year-end as the S&P approaches our 6,145 target level," CFRA said in the note. "However, the year ahead could offer additional challenges, which will likely lead to a below-average full-year gain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months to October, up from 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Futures markets currently place the odds at about two-thirds that the Fed will cut interest rates again in December by a quarter of a percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, both Dell Technologies and HP Inc. fell sharply on disappointment with their profit outlooks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dell slumped 12.3 percent and HP lost 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Department store Nordstrom also retreated, sinking 8.2 percent as it reported a 4.6 percent increase in revenues. But the company also reported lower profits in a move attributed to higher costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will be closed on Thursday and open for only a half-day on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks powered to fresh records on Tuesday, shrugging off a threat from President-elect Donald Trump to enact new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,860, its third straight closing record.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 6,021, also a record, while the Nasdaq gained 0.6 percent to 19,174.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump, who doesn't take office until January 20, made his threat in social media posts on Monday night, announcing huge import tariffs against neighbours Canada and Mexico and also China, if they do not stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling into the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors view Trump's inclination towards trade protectionism as a headwind to economic growth and higher equity prices. But Tuesday's response suggests the market views the warning as a bargaining chip.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In theory, higher tariffs should not be good news for stocks. But, you know, I think the market's chosen to think of (it) as a negotiating tactic," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You have bullish sentiment," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "People are tending to look at things as positively as possible."
  <br>
  <br>
  In other economic news, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 111.7 this month, up from 109.6 in October, boosted by greater optimism surrounding the labour market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Best Buy tumbled 4.9 percent as it cut its full-year sales outlook after a big slowdown in sales leading into the presidential election. The electronics retailer said sales have rebounded since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other retailers also fell, including Burlington Stores, down 1.6 percent; Dick's Sporting Goods, down 1.4 percent; and Kohl's, down 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amgen dropped 4.8 percent after reporting that trials of its MariTide drug led to weight loss of up to 20 percent after 52 weeks. The drop in shares appeared to show disappointment that the impact was not even greater. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 MTN South Africa has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China Telecom and Huawei for strategic collaboration that could advance the mobile operator's offerings in 5G, cloud, AI and business solutions, it said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership unites China Telecom's global expertise in network solutions with MTN's expansive regional reach and Huawei's advanced technology, creating a powerful alliance to drive digital infrastructure development on the continent," said Kai Chen, executive vice president of China Telecom Global .
  <br>
  <br>
  MTN South Africa, the country's second biggest mobile operator, said the partnership would unlock new business opportunities and offer South Africans enhanced technology, including the internet of things.
  <br>
  <br>
  The internet of things, or IoT, describes devices connecting to the internet that aren't primarily computers, such as fridges.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For MTN's business customers, network service improvements could offer new possibilities in smart mining and industrial applications," said Tumi Sekhukhune-Chamayou, chief enterprise business officer at MTN South Africa. (Reuters)

<img alt="Wall Street indices hit new highs as investors welcomed the incoming Trump Administration's choice for treasury secretary. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780799_1_20241126053432.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow finished at a second straight record on Monday, opening a holiday-shortened week with a flourish as investors applauded President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices climbed on news of the selection of hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to lead the critical economic policy position.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the indices, climbing one percent to finish at an all-time high of 44,736.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 advanced 0.3 percent to 5,987.37, and the Nasdaq Composite Index also gained 0.3 percent to 19,054.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market "breathed a sigh of relief" at Bessent's selection, said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  But after an initial surge, the gains in equities moderated somewhat. While investors are enthusiastic about the possibility of tax cuts and regulatory relief under Trump, "we do have to face the potential for tariffs being a negative as well as a very tight market around immigration, which is not positive for the economy," Hogan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition, markets are looking ahead to a fairly heavy couple of days of earnings and economic news before Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The calendar includes Wednesday's reading on personal consumption pricing, a key inflation benchmark affecting the upcoming monetary policy decision.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Macy's fell 2.3 percent as it reported preliminary results that included a 2.4 percent drop in sales to US$4.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The department store delayed the release of full earnings after a forensic investigation found an employee hid up to US$154 million in delivery expenses starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 through early November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bath & Body Works surged 16.5 percent after the retailer raised its full-year projections following quarterly earnings that exceeded its forecast. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street ended the week on a positive note, continuing earlier gains on optimism about the Trump Administration. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780490_1_20241123065830.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Dow surged to a fresh record on Friday, extending a post-election US equity rally while the euro retreated against the US dollar following weak eurozone data.
 <br>
  <br>
  The blue-chip index piled on one percent to end the day at 44,296.51, narrowly overtaking a record set earlier this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose one percent to close at 44,296.51, the S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent to 5,969.34 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 percent to 19,003.65.
  <br>
  <br>
  Major American indices have been at or near record territory since the US election, with investors betting that President-elect Donald Trump's programme of tax cuts and regulatory scale-back would more than offset the impact of expected tariff increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The trading most of this week has been influenced by the growth agenda," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers have been cheered this week by a broadening of the rally beyond the tech names that dominated earlier in the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dollar also continued to strengthen, reflecting less certainty about additional Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the US currency's status as a haven asset amid escalating tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro was also battered by a closely watched survey showing contractions in November business activity in the eurozone.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HCOB Flash Eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) published by S&P Global dropped to 48.1 compared to 50.0 in October, the most marked rate of contraction in 10 months. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, while a figure below 50 shows contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Things could hardly have turned out much worse," said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone's manufacturing sector is sinking deeper into recession, and now the services sector is starting to struggle after two months of marginal growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  But as the euro fell both Paris and Frankfurt stocks managed to recover their losses and advance.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The eurozone data has increased the chance of more rate cuts from the ECB next year," said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as well a cut of 50 basis points next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Investors have been jolted into recalibrating interest rate expectations on the back of this bleak economic news," she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  London managed to gain 1.4 percent despite data showing that retail sales figures for October undershot forecasts, as the pound fell against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin set a new record high above US$99,500 on Friday, before easing slightly.
  <br>
  <br>
  The leading digital currency is expected to push through US$100,000 as investors grow increasingly hopeful that Trump will pass measures to deregulate the crypto sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared more than 40 percent since the Republican's election victory this month and has more than doubled since the turn of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The recent surge has also been "driven by news that Trump could set up an official crypto department that would sit in the heart of US government," said XTB's Brooks. (AFP)

 The major US  indexes closed higher after choppy trading on Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow and the S&P 500 hitting one-week high.
 <br>
  <br>
  Dow Jones Industrial Average gains were aided by cloud company Salesforce's advances after three brokerages lifted their price targets on the stock.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Wall Street's biggest company, Nvidia, were up after initially choppy trading following its earnings release on Wednesday. The chip company surpassed expectations for quarterly results, and projected fourth-quarter revenue above estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Nvidia's] earnings report was really, really good. Some of the whisper numbers were higher and they disappointed there, but the fundamentals of AI and Nvidia continue to fire on all cylinders and the outlook for next year is positive," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1 percent to 43,870.35, the S&P 500 gained 0.53 percent to 5,948.49 and the Nasdaq Composite edged up fractionally to end barely changed at 18,972.27.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alphabet slid to touch a four-week low after the Justice Department argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its monopoly on online search.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock's losses weighed on the communication services sector, which was a drag on the S&P 500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon.com fell after a report said it will likely face an EU investigation next year into whether it favours its own brand products on its online marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the data front, a weekly report on jobless claims showed they fell unexpectedly last week, suggesting a rebound in job growth in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from Federal Reserve officials before the mid-December FOMC meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  Money-market bets point to a 25-basis-point interest rate cut by the Fed in December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We’ve moved on from the election a bit, we got the Nvidia report, so the next thing markets will look for is the Fed meeting, and some policy speak from Fed officials this week have pointed to maybe a pause in the making for December," Saglimbene said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said the United States is more vulnerable to inflationary shocks than in the past, according to a media report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Thursday he supports further interest rate cuts and is open to doing them more slowly.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders also monitored geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia that sent crude prices higher and aided a gain in the energy sector.

 Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent year-on-year in October, according to the official figure released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the smallest increase in five months, after the city recorded a rate of 2.2 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increases at 21.8 percent, followed by electricity, gas and water at 8.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said food prices continued to record mild increases, while energy-related items saw a slow-down in price declines.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should stay mild in the near term," a government spokesman said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic costs may see some mild upward pressures as the Hong Kong economy continues to grow. External price pressures should ease further, though uncertainties from the external environment remain."

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high on Thursday as it benefits from expectations that Donald Trump will push through measures to ease regulation of cryptocurrencies. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1780197_1_20241121111040.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin's march toward US$100,000 made further ground on Thursday as investors bet a friendlier US regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies under President-elect Donald Trump will unleash a boom era for the asset class.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin prices topped US$95,000 for the first time in Asia trade, touching a high just above US$95,040.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency's price has more than doubled this year and is up about 40 percent in the two weeks since Trump was voted in and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While it's now firmly into overbought territory, it is being drawn toward the US$100k level," said IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than US$4 billion has streamed into US listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Crypto-related stocks have been soaring along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 14 percent overnight, while MicroStrategy, a loss-making software company that has been buying bitcoin, rose 10 percent to take its market capitalisation beyond US$100 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Many are wondering if this administration will bring the regulatory clarity the crypto community has been waiting for. It's likely too soon to say," said Will Peck, head of digital assets at WisdomTree, a global exchange-traded fund issuer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We see all of this excitement as bullish not only for bitcoin or crypto broadly, but the entire blockchain-enabled ecosystem that is growing today." (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks were mixed at the end of a choppy session on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia earnings and sold off Target after weak results.
 <br>
  <br>
  One day after Walmart impressed investors with a bullish report ahead of the holiday shopping season, Target lost more than one-fifth of its market value as the retailer projected flat comparable sales in the coming quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Target "encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures," acknowledged CEO Brian Cornell, adding that he remained "confident in the underlying strength and fundamentals of our business."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 43,408.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was unchanged at 5,917, while the Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent to 18,966.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have been monitoring the brittle state of the Russia-Ukraine conflict after Moscow loosened its rules on using nuclear arms following Ukraine firing long-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  US investors have also been fixated on earnings from artificial intelligence star Nvidia due late on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia dropped 0.8 percent during the session and another 2.9 percent after the company reported US$19 billion in profits, easily topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Comcast rose 1.6 percent after announcing plans to pool together cable network channels including CNBC and MSNBC in a spin-off, further denting the conventional cable news business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ford fell 2.9 percent as it announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe, mostly in Germany and Britain. Executives also signalled they expect the incoming Trump administration to shift course on energy and climate policy, likely slowing the ramp-up of electric vehicle production. (AFP)

<img alt="Wall Street finished mixed ahead of Nvidia results on Wednesday. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1779983_1_20241120052411.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks shrugged off early weakness amid the worsening Russia-Ukraine conflict on Tuesday and finished mostly higher ahead of Nvidia results.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent much of the early going on the back foot, as Russia threatened major retaliation after Ukraine fired longer-range US missiles at its territory for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  In particular, a nuclear threat from Russian leader Vladimir Putin unsettled investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  But two of the three major indices later pushed into positive territory, with the Nasdaq finishing at 18,987, up 1.0 percent
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 5,916, while the Dow Jones declined 0.3 percent to 43,268.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're kind of on our own continent over here," Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners said of the US investor mindset.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In time, we would be impacted by an escalation of tensions. But today we're going to shrug that off, because tomorrow we get Nvidia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence star Nvidia piled on nearly five percent ahead of results on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other tech giants also advanced, Netflix and Tesla winning at least 1.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Walmart rose three percent as it lifted its full-year forecast on higher profits. Walmart's US business, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenues, enjoyed a solid 5.3 percent gain in comparable store sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Lowe's dropped 4.6 percent as it lifted some of its full-year projections. However, the home-improvement retailer still expects full-year comparable sales to be down at least three percent in 2024. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Spirit Airlines said on Monday it had filed for bankruptcy protection, after the pioneer of no-frills travel in the US struggled with a long run of quarterly losses, failed merger attempts and looming debt maturities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Spirit, the biggest US budget airline, had been losing money despite strong travel demand as it struggled with higher operating costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's troubles deepened after the collapse of its US$3.8 billion planned merger with JetBlue Airways in January and the impact of RTX's Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines snag that grounded many of its aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline listed its estimated assets and liabilities in the range of US$1 billion to US$10 billion each, according to a court filing on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit has entered into an agreement with its bondholders that is expected to reduce total debt and provide increased financial flexibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The airline, as part of the prearranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has received commitment for a US$350 million equity investment from existing bondholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Existing bondholders will also provide US$300 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing, which, together with available cash, is expected to support the airline through the Chapter 11 process.
  <br>
  <br>
  The carrier said it expected to continue its flight operations through the proceedings and customers can book and fly without interruption.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in the near term.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said it expected to emerge from the Chapter 11 process in the first quarter of 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Spirit's shares, halted for trading on Monday, have plunged more than 90 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company started out as a long-haul trucking company in 1964 before shifting to aviation around 1983. It offered leisure packages to popular destinations under the name Charter One Airlines and rebranded to Spirit in 1992. (Reuters/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks closed mixed on Monday, with traders bracing for Nvidia earnings later this week, and piling into Tesla on reports that President-elect Donald Trump could ease regulation on self-driving vehicles.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent to 43,389.60, while the S&P 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 5,893.62.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent to 18,791.81, buoyed by a jump in the share price of electric vehicle maker Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's share price jumped 5.6 percent following a Bloomberg News report over the weekend that Trump is looking to ease the restrictions on self-driving cars, which could benefit Tesla -- which is run by Trump-backer Elon Musk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But elsewhere, it was "a relatively unremarkable day, in terms of magnitude of move," said Art Hogan from B. Riley Wealth Management, adding that this wasn't surprising, citing the post-election market "explosion," and the subsequent drawback last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We kind of entered the new week at a midpoint with very little economic data," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are also looking ahead to earnings from chip designing titan Nvidia after markets close on Wednesday. (AFP)
