<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks regained some ground on Tuesday, with all three major indexes advancing and chip giant Nvidia partly recovering from a slump.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent to 44,850, while the broad-based S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent to 6,067.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index surged 2 percent to 19,733.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the gains, Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com noted that this was not a broad market advance, even though there was some buying interest after AI stocks were hard-hit a day earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were likely eyeing upcoming financial reports from tech giants as well, as they look for a sense of confidence that Monday's slump was "an overreaction."
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, US chipmaker Nvidia led a rout in tech stocks after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese generative AI model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia, whose semiconductors power the AI industry, saw its shares drop nearly 17 percent, erasing almost US$600 billion of its market value.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek said it spent just US$5.6 million developing its model, a small amount compared with the billions US tech giants have poured into AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia shares ended 8.9 percent up on Tuesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Looking ahead, investors will also be eyeing the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the end of their gathering. (AFP)

    'DeepSeek may not cause shift in flow of global funds'

<img alt="A local finance expert says the release of DeepSeek is a good thing for the development of artificial intelligence. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789484_1_20250128184931.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial experts in Hong Kong on Tuesday said low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model DeepSeek may not necessarily cause a shift in the flow of global funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The release of the AI assistant led to a sell-off in Nvidia shares, which fell 17 percent on Monday, wiping nearly US$600 billion from the AI chip market leader’s market value – a record one-day loss for any company.
  <br>
  <br>
  The startup behind DeepSeek said it uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available, a comment that has garnered attention worldwide, and sparked speculation that global investors will look for cheaper AI options.
  <br>
  <br>
  Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, pointed out that intense competition is commonplace in the AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think what we have seen from DeepSeek is the fact that the Chinese have innovated using older chips and being able to use them by understanding the architecture better and linking them better together," Sullivan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's difficult to see how utilising old chips is really going to keep up with the modern advances that we're seeing in the current generation and the next reiteration of the Nvidia chips, so I think there's still going to be a lot of competition there," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  Almagest Asset Management chief executive James Wong said DeepSeek’s emergence is a good thing for the development of AI, but he did not think it would cause a significant change in terms of global capital flow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It doesn't come as a surprise for us that the cost of developing the model R1 is that much less than the cost that OpenAI is running," Wong said, using the name of DeepSeek’s open-source AI model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the city's Hang Seng Index rose for the third straight session in a row, increasing 0.1 percent to close at 20,225, partially boosted by the optimism generated by DeepSeek. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<img alt="The chatbot, developed in Hangzhou, reportedly matches the capacity of US AI pace-setters, sending shockwaves through US markets overnight.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December 18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in US chipmakers.
 <br>
  <br>
  AI leader Nvidia sank 17 percent, and about US$590 billion in stock market value, the deepest ever one-day loss for a company on Wall Street, according to LSEG data. It was more than double the previous one-day record loss, set by Nvidia last September.
  <br>
  <br>
  An index of semiconductor stocks dropped 9.2 percent in its biggest single-day percentage fall since March 2020.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese startup DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant that it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, raising questions about investor expectations that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centers.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek's AI Assistant by Monday had overtaken US rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's App Store.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, said there are still many questions about the DeepSeek model and its impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today is a drubbing for these (AI leader) stocks, but I don't necessarily think whatever's going to happen in the short while here - the next couple of days - is where they are ultimately valued," she said. Optimism over AI and gains in Nvidia and other big technology-related shares helped to drive the stock market's sharp gains in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65 percent, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46  percent, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07 percent, to 19,341.83.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 registered its biggest one-day percentage fall since January 10.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other big tech-related companies, Microsoft shares fell 2.1 percent and Google-parent Alphabet dropped 4.2 percent, while AI server maker Dell Technologies declined 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data centre operators also tanked, including Digital Realty, which fell 8.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Power companies, which are expected to see higher demand from energy-intensive data centres needed to develop AI technology, also fell. Vistra dropped 28.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech stocks are likely to stay in focus this week, with some big technology names, including Microsoft, due to post-quarterly results.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are keen to hear from the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to hold its lending rate steady in its first interest-rate decision of the year due on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market watchers also were digesting news that the US and Colombia had pulled back from the brink of a trade war on Sunday after the White House said the South American nation had agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hang Seng Bank has been fined HK$66.4 million for regulatory failures and overcharging clients.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Securities and Futures Commission on Monday said it found significant regulatory breaches on the bank’s sale of collective investment scheme and derivative products between February 2014 and May 2023, during which clients were overcharged and inadequately informed about the financial benefits.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Hang Seng Bank received at least HK$22.4 million in excess fees from these transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SFC concluded that the bank had failed to operate with due care and diligence, ensure adequate disclosure to clients, prevent conflicts of interest, and comply with regulatory requirements necessary to protect client interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank, for its part, said it accepts the investigation findings, adding that it has already compensated the affected clients and taken remedial actions to rectify and strengthen its internal controls.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firm DeepSeek's artificial intelligence chatbot has soared to the top of the Apple Store's download charts, stunning industry insiders and analysts with its ability to match its US competitors at a lower cost.
 <br>
  <br>
  The programme has shaken up the tech industry and hit US titans including Nvidia and Meta, which has spent vast sums of cash to get ahead in the fast-developing AI sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nasdaq futures slumped and technology shares slid in Japan on Monday as surging popularity of DeepSeek's product wobbled investors' faith in the profitability of AI and the sector's voracious demand for high-tech chips.
  <br>
  <br>
  DeepSeek has rolled out a free assistant it says uses lower-cost chips and less data, seemingly challenging a widespread bet in financial markets that AI will drive demand along a supply chain from chipmakers to data centres.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a case of a crowded trade, and now DeepSeek is giving a reason for investors and traders to unwind," said Wong Kok Hoong, head of equity sales trading at Maybank.
  <br>
  <br>
  AI-focused startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than eight percent, on course for its biggest one-day fall since September 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week it announced a US$19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-centre joint venture with OpenAI. (Agencies)

<img alt="Eddie Yue, HKMA chief executive, says the global investment outlook remains challenging in 2025. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789327_1_20250127181821.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Monday said income from the exchange fund fell by 3.1 percent in 2024 to HK$219 billion.
 <br>
  <br>
  For the whole year, income from bond investments dropped 6.3 percent year-on-year to HK$135.6 billion, while income from non-local equity investments declined 6.7 percent to HK$68.7 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The foreign exchange valuation of non-Hong Kong dollar assets also fell by HK$35.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, income from local equity investments gained HK$21.8 billion, while returns on other investments stood at HK$28.5 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2023, the fund used to defend the Hong Kong dollar saw a HK$226 billion gain, its best ever result.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said the fourth-quarter loss last year was due to increased volatility in the global markets following geopolitical risks, as well as increasing concerns over inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The strong US dollar also weighed on other major currencies during the period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue said further challenges lie ahead.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The new US administration's policies on the economy, tax and trade could add uncertainties to the inflation path, and that, in turn, affects how much room the Fed has for adjusting monetary policy," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[And] any escalation in trade frictions among major economies or geopolitical situation could impact real economic activities, and may also trigger volatility in the financial markets."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Property developer China Vanke on Monday said its chairman Yu Liang and CEO Zhu Jiusheng had resigned, amid concerns over the company's liquidity as it faces several debt maturity deadlines this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Vanke warned Monday that it incurred major losses in 2024, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vanke said it expected a net loss of approximately 45 billion yuan (US$6.2 billion) in 2024, citing reasons including "the continuous market downturn" and "sales and gross profit margins (that) turned out to be lower than investment expectations". (Agencies)

    China's factory output falls in January

<img alt="Workers producing photovoltaic modules for solar panels in a factory in Suqian, Jiangsu province. China's PMI dipped below the 50-mark in January, indicating contraction in manufacturing activity. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789279_1_20250127115151.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official data on Monday showed that China's purchasing managers' index (PMI) for its domestic manufacturing sector came in at 49.1 in January, down from 50.1 in December.
 <br>
  <br>
  That's below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI for China's non-manufacturing sector, which includes services and construction, was also lower in January coming in at 50.2, down from 52.2 in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, the combined profit of major industrial enterprises went up 11 percent year on year in December 2024, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said the PMI data in January was influenced by factors such as the approaching Chinese New Year holiday and enterprise employees' returning home for festival reunions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's second-largest economy hit the government's growth target of around five percent over 2024, but exports and industrial output far outpaced retail sales and unemployment remained elevated.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's threat to impose a 10 percent punitive duty on Chinese imports on February 1 also adds to the lingering uncertainty surrounding the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus reached almost US$1 trillion last year, as producers looked to shift stocks overseas to counter weak domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country's outbound shipments were further assisted by factory gate deflation and a weak yuan, making Chinese goods more competitive in global markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Back at home, falling prices affected corporate profits and workers' incomes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Policymakers have promised to roll out further stimulus over 2025, in addition to the ones already implemented last year, as Beijing prioritises revitalising domestic demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Getting mainland consumers spending again would reduce producers' exposure to Trump's tariff threats, which he said could be as high as 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  State leaders are also hoping last year's policy support measures will increase demand in the struggling property sector and ease developers' financial difficulties, which affects domestic demand and local government finances. (Xinhua/Reuters)

    Profit-taking pushes US markets lower

<img alt="Wall Street's major indices opened flat, and ended the session lower. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789069_1_20250125055434.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets concluded a winning week on a tepid note on Friday, retreating following mixed earnings in a move attributed to profit taking.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a flattish open, all three major indices moved into negative territory -- a trend that held the rest of the session.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is normal consolidation or profit taking after a big 2-week rally," said Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500, which closed at a record on Thursday, fell 0.3 percent to 6,101.24.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average also declined 0.3 percent to 44,424.25, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.5 percent to 19,954.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have gained in recent sessions following benign US inflation data, strong earnings from banks and the new presidency of Donald Trump in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets have thus far welcomed his growth-oriented agenda and largely shrugged off his threats of tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sarhan said the market was poised for a pause given the heavy calendar next week, which includes a Federal Reserve monetary policy decision and earnings from tech giants and other big companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Facebook parent Meta gained 3.2 percent after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would invest up to US$65 billion in 2025 in new artificial intelligence infrastructure, including a datacentre "so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan."
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing dropped 1.4 percent after announcing it will incur a bigger than expected loss in the fourth quarter due mainly to costs connected to a lengthy labour strike last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others with big earnings-related moves included American Express, down 1.4 percent; CSX, down 5.8 percent; and Texas Instruments, down 13.1 percent. (AFP)

    Japan's interest rates highest in 17 years

<img alt="Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference that the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined. Photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1789025_1_20250124192649.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised interest rates on Friday to their highest in 17 years and signalled more hikes to come, sending the yen higher against the greenback.
 <br>
  <br>
  The 25-basis-point rise to 0.5 percent comes as data indicated the Japanese economy was developing in line with BoJ expectations and followed another bumper inflation reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move, which leaves borrowing costs at the highest since 2008, was also underpinned by "steadily" rising wages and financial markets being "stable on the whole", the BoJ said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Japan's economic activity and prices have been developing generally in line with the Bank's outlook, and the likelihood of realising the outlook has been rising," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  If its outlook is met, "the bank will accordingly continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  BoJ chief Kazuo Ueda told a news conference the pace and timing of future hikes was yet to be determined.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We would like to make a decision after we have studied the impact of this rate hike," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The hawkish comments sent the yen up as much as 0.7 percent against the US dollar to 154.84 yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Even as other central banks have raised borrowing costs in recent years -- and started cutting again in 2024 -- the BoJ has remained an outlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it concluded last March that Japan's "lost decades" of economic stagnation and static, or falling prices were over, finally lifting rates above zero.
  <br>
  <br>
  That increase was followed by another in July that caught investors off guard and sparked turmoil in global equity and currency markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  This time Ueda prepared markets for an increase -- some 75 percent of economists expected one -- and the reaction was more muted on Friday. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Home prices fell 7.1 percent in 2024, official figures showed on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the third year in a row of declining prices, which have dropped 27 percent since the start of 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  Eddie Kwok, executive director of CBRE Hong Kong’s valuation and advisory services, said price increases could be on the cards after Lunar New Year and the financial secretary's budget speech next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kwok said major banks have lowered their prime rates since the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut last September and since then prices have been stabilising.
  <br>
  <br>
  Martin Wong, head of research and consultancy for Greater China at Knight Frank, said prices could rebound by up to five percent this year, with most of the increase likely to come in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  Figures from the Rating and Valuation Department also showed that prices fell 0.7 percent in December from the month before, ending a two-month increase.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the city's financial system remains robust, despite intensified geopolitical risks causing greater volatility in regional and global markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan made the remark during a discussion on "stemming financial fragmentation", at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said Hong Kong "steadfastly" upholds the linked exchange rate system, or the currency peg, and that recent surveys showed global investors were optimistic about the SAR's business outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that the city has undergone significant transformations in the stock markets, wealth management and digital asset sectors, as he also stressed that China's economy is steadily growing and achieving high-quality development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the finance minister continued to promote green finance projects, as well as "impact investments", or funds aimed at generating social or environmental effects.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan held talks on trade with some of his global counterparts, including the investment minister of Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Falih, and the finance chief of Egypt, Ahmed Kouchouk. Chan invited the ministers to visit the SAR as part of efforts to deepen ties with the Global South.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also met Jenny Johnson, CEO of investment firm Franklin Templeton, to discuss how to expand the company's business in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan is due to return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended higher on Thursday, shrugging off early weakness as investors digested President Donald Trump's remarks to the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's much-anticipated video appearance included a call for lower interest rates, a renewed threat of tariffs on companies that plan to import items and a pledge to cut corporate taxes further.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors cheered the message on tax cuts, which Trump held out as a "carrot" to attract investment as compared with the "stick" of tariffs, said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.9 percent at 44,565.07.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 climbed 0.5 percent to 6,118.71, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.2 percent to 20,053.68.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Certainly everyone understands the tariff message and now we're hearing more about the tax incentives," said Ablin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin noted that Trump has not advanced a campaign trail proposal to hike tariffs on Chinese goods by 60 percent, evidence of some "moderation" in the returning president's tone.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, American Airlines slumped 8.7 percent as it issued a disappointing profit forecast for 2025. The carrier projected a loss in the first quarter, but predicted travel demand would strengthen later in the year, boosting earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But GE Aerospace jumped 6.6 percent as it reported better than expected profits and offered a positive 2025 outlook on robust demand for commercial aviation engines and services. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific says it will give its staff bonuses worth at least a month's pay following positive financial results in the past year.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a letter to employees, CEO Ronald Lam said the final level will be announced alongside the company's annual financial postings in mid-March.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm pleased to share that we will be distributing at least four weeks of eligible pay this year," Lam said on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also told staff that the company successfully completed its rebuilding journey last year, allowing flights to return to 100 percent of pre-Covid levels this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our strong financial performance for two years in a row also made it possible for us to commit more than HK$100 billion investments into further elevating our customers' experience in the future," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lam vowed to work towards Cathay's vision of "becoming one of the world's greatest service brands".
  <br>
  <br>
  The company's four lines of business, namely Cathay Pacific, Cathay Cargo, Cathay Lifestyle and HK Express, have formulated robust plans to serve customers and deliver great profitability, Lam added.

    'SME business confidence shaken by Trump policies'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's incoming policies are casting a shadow over business confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the city, an economist said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Kelvin Lau, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said Washington has contributed to global economic uncertainties.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the biggest uncertainties recently is the retrenchment of US rate cut expectations. Secondly, it's the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, how fast and how far he would take them higher," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to the results of a Productivity Council survey, the Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index fell to 42.8 in the January-to-March period, down 2.9 points from the previous three months. Figures below 50 indicate a negative outlook, while those above 50 show a positive one.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop indicated the overall business confidence of local SMEs "has become more conservative under the uncertain global economic outlook", the council said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the more than 800 local firms polled, around 38 percent said the US presidential transition had affected their business confidence.
  <br>
  <br>
  They cited potential tariffs and changes in the economic environment as primary factors. Trump had warned of imposing a 10 percent duty on Chinese imports as soon as February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “A lot of things are less to do with local issues, but more to do with external issues. But then the downside is, because it's external, there are a very few things that we can actually control about it," Lau said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We're just hoping that we can also benefit from more policy easing from the US and from China as well. Hopefully the achievement of a global soft landing will help Hong Kong maintain a modest pace of recovery."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lau added that the first round of potential tariffs would be "in line with market expectations", and further hikes, which might not come until 2026, would bring more certainty to enterprises.

<img alt="Beijing has unveiled plans to support the markets by ordering pensions and mutual funds to invest more in domestic stocks. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788800_1_20250123122135.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China announced plans on Thursday to channel hundreds of billions of yuan annually into shares from state-owned insurers, in the country's latest effort to support its domestic equity markets.
 <br>
  <br>
  Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan (US$13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30 percent of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10 percent annually over the next three years, Wu said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wu also said China's public offering fund sector had maintained a stable development trend in recent years, with further measures set to boost the development of this sector in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Assets under the management of China's public offering funds rose to 33 trillion yuan (about US$4.6 trillion) by the end of 2024 from 13 trillion yuan in 2019, according to Wu.
  <br>
  <br>
  In 2025, the sales fees of public offering funds would be further slashed, saving a total of 45 billion yuan annually for investors, Wu told the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index advanced 1.47 percent shortly after open on Thursday while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.62 percent. The Hang Seng Index similarly gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, the country's financial authorities signalled they would encourage medium- and long-term funds into the capital market to further stabilise stock performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  The document, jointly released by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission, as well as five government departments, stressed attracting funds from commercial insurance, national social security and basic pension funds.
  <br>
  <br>
  Annuity funds, public funds, and other medium- to long-term capital funds were also expected to increase their stock market investments, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The plan aims to increase the proportion and stability of A-share investment in the portfolios of commercial insurance companies, and improve the investment management mechanism of the national social security fund and the basic pension insurance fund.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of state-owned insurance companies will be assessed over a cycle of more than three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  For the national social security and basic pension funds, the evaluation periods will be over five years and over three years, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  Authorities have been intensifying policy support to prop up share prices as the world's second-largest economy navigates deflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They introduced swap and re-lending schemes totalling 800 billion yuan for stock purchases in September as well as guidelines on market capitalisation management to encourage companies to improve shareholder returns. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has met with his counterparts from Qatar and Switzerland in Davos as he continued to promote Hong Kong's competitive edge on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan on Wednesday held talks with Ali bin Ahmed Al-Kuwari, the Qatari finance minister, and Daniela Stoffel, state secretary for international finance of Switzerland.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They exchanged insights on the latest global economic and financial landscapes and discussed ways to enhance co-operation between Hong Kong and both economies in trade, financial services and infrastructure," according to a statement by the SAR government.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also held bilateral meetings with government officials and business leaders from different countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  He discussed strategies to "prevent a new, non-co-operative normal" with some 70 political and economic leaders, according to the statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial secretary also told the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, that Hong Kong values taking part in the annual forum.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This platform offers an opportunity for Hong Kong to showcase its latest economic and social developments to global leaders, and the city's unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle," the statement read.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Such participation also enables Hong Kong representatives to better understand international trends, exchange views with various economic and sectoral representatives, and present Hong Kong's perspectives."

 Tech shares led US stocks higher on Wednesday following strong earnings from Netflix and a White House announcement that reignited enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Netflix piled on nearly 10 percent after announcing price increases in several markets, including the United States, and revealing that its subscribers have topped 300 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of AI-linked companies such as Arm, Microsoft and Nvidia also advanced following a White House announcement of some US$500 billion in new AI infrastructure by Softbank and other tech giants.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 1.3 percent to 20,009.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 percent to 44,156, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, just under an all-time record.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Today was back to excitement over AI," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's session also included a trove of other corporate earnings reports, most of which topped estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Procter & Gamble climbed 1.9 percent as it reported higher profits and confirmed full-year targets for increased sales. The consumer products giant has seen improvement in China but emphasized that a complete turnaround will take time.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seagate Technology, a data storage company also active in AI, jumped 6.8 percent after reporting a 50 percent jump in quarterly revenues to US$2.3 billion. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said banks have made preparations to deal with any risks posed by potential US trade tariffs and are closely monitoring developments.
 <br>
  <br>
  At a press briefing about the banking sector's performance in 2024, HKMA deputy chief executive Arthur Yuen noted that there's a lack of clarity in terms of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, you can expect that if the US imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then the global trade system will suffer and that would actually also impact on business outlook, " Yuen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have actually asked our banks to stay on high alert on what's the impact of those, and to make sure the risk-management practices are fully in place for handling whatever is coming their way."

<img alt="Arthur Yuen, HKMA‘s deputy chief executive (center), says there's been a significant jump in the number of fraud cases locally. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788711_1_20250122190533.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Wednesday said that it is allocating more resources to tackle financial and banking related frauds, following a surge in deception cases last year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Arthur Yuen, the authority’s deputy chief executive, said during a press conference that over 40,000 fraud cases were reported to the police in the first 11 months of last year – an increase of 8.7 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses incurred totaled HK$8.5 billion, meaning some HK$25 million were lost each day -- an amount Yuen said was "really concerning".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have seen very important, serious cases of people losing their life savings simply because they have clicked on links or they have answered calls without caution," he said, adding that a new promotional campaign was launched to discourage people from clicking onto fraudulent hyperlinks.
  <br>
  <br>
  A suspicious account alert system was also expanded last month for automatic teller machines to issue fraud alert over high-risk transfers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other measures, meanwhile, include a "Money Safe" tool that the authority hopes to make available in the first or second quarter of this year, to allow customers to lock all or part of their bank account balances.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Yuen said the city's banking sector posted the slowest profit growth in three years, with the aggregated pre-tax profit among 30 retail banks increasing by only 8.3 percent year on year in the first three quarters of 2024, compared to the 62 percent annual growth registered in 2023.

 Shares in Japanese tech behemoth SoftBank Group soared more than eight per cent on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a major investment to build AI infrastructure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.
  <br>
  <br>
  SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.
  <br>
  <br>
  The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.
  <br>
  <br>
  In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called "Stargate", set to launch in 2028.
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks jumped on Tuesday as markets greeted early moves by US President Donald Trump that raised hopes new tariffs won't be as bad as feared.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's first day back in the White House included a litany of executive actions, but while he threatened new tariffs on Mexico and Canada, the trade announcements were "more benign than expected," said a note from Goldman Sachs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other analysts pointed out that Trump did not announce immediate tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2 percent at 44,025.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent to 6,049, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent to 19,756.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's gains came as US Treasury yields edged lower, a sign investors remain less perturbed by inflation worries following last week's consumer price data.
  <br>
  <br>
  While several large technology companies moved higher, an exception was Apple, which slumped 3.2 percent following a report of weak China sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  Electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive fell 6.5 percent following a Trump executive order that takes aim at programs favoring EVs. EV charging companies ChargePoint Holdings and EVgo also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dow member 3M gained 4.2 percent as it reported better than expected profits. William Brown, CEO of the industrial products company, pointed to strong sales momentum, saying "we are confident in our ability to deliver our 2025 guidance." (AFP)

    Inflation at 1.4 percent in December

<img alt="Overall consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in December 2024 over the same month a year earlier. File photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788517_1_20250121170542.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Overall consumer prices rose by 1.4 percent in December compared to the same month the year before, official figures showed on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  It was the same rate as seen in October and November.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Census and Statistics Department said underlying inflation, which nets out the effects of the government's one-off relief measures, rose 1.3 percent year-on-year, slightly higher than the 1.2 percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Prices for alcoholic drinks and tobacco saw the biggest increase last month, rising 21.2 percent year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was followed by the prices for electricity, gas, and water, which rose 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Clothing and footwear prices fell, however, by 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  A government spokesperson said underlying consumer price inflation remained modest last month, with prices of major components broadly in check.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain moderate in the near term. As the Hong Kong economy continues to grow, domestic cost may see some upward pressures. External price pressures should remain contained, though uncertainties from the external environment warrant attention," the spokesperson added.
  <br>
  <br>
  For 2024 as a whole, overall consumer prices were 1.7 percent higher than in the previous year, while the underlying inflation rate stood at 1.1 percent.

    China stocks up but wary of Trump's tariff intentions

<img alt='Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries. Photo: AFP' src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788495_2_20250121153340.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to "investigate and remedy" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.
  <br>
  <br>
  Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  These could pave the way for further duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.
  <br>
  <br>
  The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's start to his presidency "is better than I expected," said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return "marginally positive" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who "sought to strangle China to death".
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively "operating" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back," Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.
  <br>
  <br>
  Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The canal is and will remain Panama's," President Jose Raul Mulino said.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Shares of China's embattled Country Garden jumped as much as 11 percent in resumed trade on Tuesday following a more than nine-month trading suspension to give time for the developer to prepare delayed financial statements for 2023 and 2024.
 <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, a lawyer for Country Garden, once China's biggest developers, told a Hong Kong court that the company expected to reach terms with creditors next month regarding the restructuring of US$16.4 billion in offshore debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  The stock had been suspended from trading since April 2 pending the publication of its 2023 full-year and 2024 interim financial reports after it defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds in late 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  Guangdong-based Country Garden has now been granted an adjournment until May 26 in a court hearing held to gauge the extent to which its debt restructuring is proceeding ahead of a decision on a liquidation petition.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Country Garden were up 11 percent in early trade on Tuesday at HK$0.54, compared with its last trading price of HK$0.485 before the suspension in April. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained stable in the final three months of last year at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the previous figure.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate was also unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total employment increased by about 7,100 to 3,718,900, while the labour force barely changed at 3,831,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of unemployed people fell by around 6,100 to 113,600, while the number of underemployed individuals dropped by about 1,800 to 43,500.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the overall jobless rate remained low and there were improvements in the manufacturing, financing, social work, arts, entertainment and recreation sectors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market should remain largely stable in the near term, though the employment situation in some sectors might be more affected by the increased uncertainties in the global environment," he added.

    Bitcoin reaches new record on Trump comeback

<img alt="Bitcoin hit a record high, trading above US$109,000 on Monday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788326_1_20250120170729.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin hit a record high above US$109,000 on Monday as Donald Trump, who has signalled plans to deregulate the cryptocurrency sector, prepares to be sworn in as US president.
 <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin surged to reach an all-time peak of US$109,241 ahead of Trump's inauguration ceremony, before falling back to US$107,765.
  <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared since Trump won the presidential election in November, with bitcoin surpassing US$100,000 for the first time in early December.
  <br>
  <br>
  It came after he nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the new president will deregulate the sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite having once branded cryptocurrencies a "scam", Trump changed his stance and was a major advocate of them during his election campaign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over the weekend, he launched his own cryptocurrency, appropriately called $TRUMP, sparking feverish buying that sent its market capitalisation soaring to several billion dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  When bitcoin reached the landmark US$100,000 level, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! US$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!"
  <br>
  <br>
  Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was pitched as a way to break free of mainstream financial institutions by establishing a decentralised platform for transactions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The digital currency is created -- or "mined" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on a meddle-proof register known as the blockchain.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has long been criticised for being the currency of choice for making untraceable payments on the so-called dark web, a hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The asset has often come under attack for facilitating money laundering and allowing extortion through ransomware attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its carbon footprint has also come under scrutiny because mining cryptocurrencies requires huge amounts of energy. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese property giant Country Garden, which previously defaulted on its debt repayment obligations, expects to reach agreeable terms with creditors next month, the firm's lawyer told a Hong Kong court on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an "understanding" with a lender group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ever Credit Limited, a unit of Hong Kong-listed Kingboard Holdings, filed a petition against Country Garden in February last year for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. (Reuters)

    SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis

<img alt="South Korea's central bank cuts its 2025 growth forecast due to the country's ongoing political crisis. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788281_1_20250120120734.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.
  <br>
  <br>
  He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment," the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.
  <br>
  <br>
  The political turmoil and crash "led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection", the bank said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but "the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent", it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand," it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.
  <br>
  <br>
  He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.
  <br>
  <br>
  If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stock indexes closed their best week in two months with a flourish on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 59.32 points, or one percent, to 5,996.66. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 334.70, or 0.8 percent, to 43,487.83, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 291.91 points, or 1.5 percent, to 19,630.20.
  <br>
  <br>
  The gains were driven by big tech stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the companies in the so-called Magnificent Seven rose: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks were helped this week by an encouraging report on US inflation , which raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may deliver more interest rate cuts this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the latest inflation data, some experts are still bearish about the prospects for more cuts. With the US economy in solid overall shape, "you shouldn't fix what's not broken," Bank of America economists Claudio Irigoyen and Antonio Gabriel said in a BofA Global Research report.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also pointed to the uncertainties created by "Trumponomics 2.0," amid fears that the new administration's policies could help push up inflation. (AP)

    IMF raises global growth outlook

<img alt="The IMF expects global growth to increase slightly this year, although still below pre-pandemic levels. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1788065_1_20250117222710.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Global growth is expected to increase slightly this year while remaining stuck below its pre-pandemic average, the IMF said on Friday, flagging the growing economic divide between the United States and European countries.
 <br>
  <br>
  In an update to its flagship World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global growth to hit 3.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its previous forecast in October, and to remain at 3.3 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Growth is steady," IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding it remained below the average global growth rate in the first two decades of the 21st century of 3.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects the global inflation rate to continue decelerating, reaching 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2026, with prices cooling faster in advanced economies than in emerging markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Among advanced economies, the interesting development here is the strength and resilience and growth of the US economy," Gourinchas said, pointing to the IMF's decision to hike its outlook for US growth to 2.7 percent in 2025 and to 2.1 percent in 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The labour market has been strong, there is strong demand, private demand is robust, there is good confidence," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF expects China's growth rate to continue cooling this year to 4.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from the October forecast, before easing to 4.5 percent next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slight upgrade was due to the Chinese government's recently announced package of fiscal support to help prop up the economy, amid an ongoing property market slump and uncertainty about trade policy once Donald Trump takes office next week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy is leading to something of a "rebalancing" among emerging markets, Gourinchas said, with countries including India -- which the IMF expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year and next -- playing a more important role.
  <br>
  <br>
  Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to pick up by less than previously forecast due largely to the effect of oil production cuts by the Opec+ group of oil-producing nations, which includes Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the risks to the IMF's forecasts is policy uncertainty in the United States, where Trump is preparing to return to the White House and has threatened to unleash tariffs on a host of nations including China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the economic picture in America stands in stark contrast to the Euro area, where a sharp downgrade for Germany has dampened expectations for a rebound in growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IMF now sees Euro area growth to increase slightly to 1.0 percent this year, and 1.4 percent in 2026, below its October forecasts. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said the government was very cautious when considering tax reforms and that many factors had to be taken into consideration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the government hoped to achieve a fiscal balance in three years, but the SAR would focus more on managing costs than generating revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In terms of raising taxes, first, we must consider our competitiveness, comparing to our neighbouring regions and the impact on attracting enterprises and investment," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Second, as society recovers from the pandemic, including small and medium enterprises, big corporations, and even individuals, we have to rebuild our balance sheets. We hope to provide more room for companies and individuals to strengthen their financial abilities."
  <br>
  <br>
  The government deducted one percent from the recurrent expenditure resources of government departments from the 2024/25 financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister said the government would look into whether there was a need to further reduce expenditures in his Budget, due to be announced next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  On whether the "affordable users pay" principle could be further implemented, he said Hong Kong has to work on it in a gradual and orderly way.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added there were currently no plans to cut costs on infrastructure, saying the Northern Metropolis project could not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong would see more opportunities than challenges this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a forum organised by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chan said the city's economy saw improvements in the past year in areas like innovation and technology, while attracting enterprises and investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief said the economic performance of Asian countries was strong, which included China recording five percent GDP growth in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said Hong Kong should continue to leverage its unique advantages, and reinforce its connectivity with both the mainland and the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While consolidating traditional markets in Europe and the United States that are closely connected to Hong Kong, we have to fully explore new markets and sources of capital at the same time," Chan said.

  "Hong Kong not only acts as a bridge for the mainland and advanced economies like Western countries and the United States, but it also serves as a link for the mainland and Global South countries, including in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan said Hong Kong's economy would still undergo a structural adjustment this year, and the United States' presidential handover would bring uncertainties to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he stressed that the SAR would have a "better future" through reform and change.

 More than 9,000 bankruptcy applications were made in Hong Kong last year, the highest annual number in almost a decade.
 <br>
  <br>
  Data released by the Official Receiver's Office on Friday showed 9,190 petitions for bankruptcy were recorded, up 17 percent from 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was the highest number since 9,875 applications were made in 2015.

  There were 781 applications in December alone, representing a 16 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of bankruptcy orders by the court last year also rose, standing at 8,553.
  <br>
  <br>
  The office also received 740 compulsory winding-up petitions, a 30 percent jump over the number in 2023 and the highest figure since 2009.
  <br>
  <br>
  There were 443 court orders last year for companies to be liquidated.

    China economy expands 5 percent in 2024

<img alt="China's GDP grew 5 percent year on year in 2024, official data showed on Friday. Photo: RTHK" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787956_1_20250117101930.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy ended 2024 on better footing than expected, growing 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, to put the full-year GDP growth at 5 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Boosted by a flurry of stimulus measures, the economy grew at the quickest pace since the second quarter of 2023 in the final quarter of 2024, to help authorities meet their annual growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The national economy was generally stable with steady progress and new achievements were made in high-quality development,” a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Particularly, with a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out, the social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,” it added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Reflecting on the nation's growth for 2024, NBS commissioner Kang Yi touched on the challenges at home and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The year of 2024 witnessed a complex international environment... and there was a lack of efficient demand, and pains in the shift of growth drivers," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Despite all that, the Chinese economy withstood pressures, overcame difficulties, making a new contribution to global growth," Kang added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the latest figures, Raymond Yeung, Greater China Chief Economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), said it was in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, he noted the troubled property sector remains a concern, despite slight improvements in new domestic home prices, with those in first-tier cities edging up 0.2 percent last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's still too early to conclude if there is a stablisation in the property market. Of course the property prices in both the first-hand and secondary markets seemed to have improved, but they are still contracting, still in the negative region on a monthly basis," he said, adding that transaction volumes still dropped around 17 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We really need to see an overall improvement of the property prices, a sustainable improvement, because the wealth effect determines whether households are willing to spend, and also affects the assessment of the economic prospects in the future."
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, manufacturing was a strong engine for growth last year, with industrial output jumping 5.8 percent from a year earlier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Total retail sales of consumer goods grew 3.5 percent at an annual rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports expanded 7.1 percent in annual terms, while imports grew 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, were up 3.5 percent. Industrial output rose by 5.8 percent. (Agencies)

    Retail sales figures cast pall over US markets

<img alt="Wall Street ended lower as investors digested the latest US retail figures. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1787923_1_20250117063623.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished lower on Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lacklustre."
  <br>
  <br>
  US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December. That was slower than November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates.
  <br>
  <br>
  The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high.
  <br>
  <br>
  After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London.
  <br>
  <br>
  London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group said there were "threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment," Brooks added.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, investors remain cautious ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.2 percent to 43,153.13, the S&P 500 also lost 0.2 percent to 5,937.34, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 percent to 19,338.29.  (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales in the United States cooled in December, according to government data released on Thursday, despite receiving a boost from petrol stations and autos.
 <br>
  <br>
  The performance was likely helped by replacement vehicle sales after the devastation of Hurricane Helene in September, analysts said, and consumers buying cars earlier to avoid potentially higher tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But still, overall, sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, reaching US$729.2 billion, the Department of Commerce said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a slower pace than November's 0.8 percent reading.
  <br>
  <br>
  From a year ago, retail sales were up 3.9 percent in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  For all of 2024, total sales were 3.0 percent higher from 2023, said the report.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among sectors, sales at restaurants and bars slid 0.3 percent from November to December, while those at building material and supplies dealers dropped 2.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But at motor vehicle and parts dealers, sales rose 0.7 percent on-month, while those at petrol stations jumped 1.5 percent – likely due to higher petrol prices in December.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Attempts to get ahead of post-tariff price hikes seem to be lifting measures of underlying retail sales," said economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen of Pantheon Macroeconomics in a recent note.
  <br>
  <br>
  But they warned: "Sales (that) pulled forward due to hurricane damage and the threat of tariffs, or a passing boost from the shifting timing of Black Friday, do not provide the foundation for a sustained climb in spending." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong is the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to expand their business overseas, as Tencent-backed digital lender WeBank opened a Hong Kong headquarters for its new tech arm.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at the inauguration and signing ceremony for WeBank Technology, Chan said the city's financial technology ecosystem has seen positive growth in recent years, with the number of firms in the sector growing 15 percent year-on-year to 1,100 in 2024, including eight digital banks and four digital insurance companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong has the unique advantage to connect the mainland with the world, and is also the most preferred platform for mainland enterprises to go overseas," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As we have a full chain of financing and professional services, this could support WeBank Technology to export its advanced tech and explore business expansion in the international market, especially, to provide more inclusive financial services to countries in the Global South to support local social and economic development."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shenzhen vice-mayor Luo Huanghao, who also attended the event, said the mainland's tech hub will collaborate with Hong Kong to further promote the application of the digital yuan through more trials.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank president Li Nanqing said the opening of the new headquarters in Hong Kong can help the company expand along Belt and Road countries and boost economic integration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  WeBank gained regulatory approval to set up its fintech subsidiary in Hong Kong last July and plans to invest up to US$150 million and create high-skilled jobs in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Apple lost its status as the best selling smartphone brand in the crucial Chinese market last year, new data showed on Thursday, with a pair of local rivals surpassing it with surging shipments.
 <br>
  <br>
  The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape," said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple "faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices".
  <br>
  <br>
  Top-ranked Vivo showed "strong momentum" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping "solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments".
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The R&D centre at Hong Kong's Automotive Platforms and Applications Systems (APAS) on Thursday warned electric vehicle (EV) owners to be careful when charging their cars on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br>
  The centre said most EVs in Hong Kong use either Japanese or American charging standards and an adaptor is usually needed to charge them on the mainland.
  <br>
  <br>
  But such adaptors are hard to find, the centre said, with those that are available coming with a price tag of between several thousand and tens of thousands of dollars.
  <br>
  <br>
  There's also a lack of standardisation regarding safety when it comes to the adaptors, the centre said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chief Executive Officer of the centre Du Yonghai said to help solve these problems, they are developing their own adaptor which they plan to make commercially available.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have been actively engaging with several partners so that we can commercialise that product, that solution and make it available to the market," Du said.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of last month, about 100,000 electronic vehicles were registered in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong has urged the government to provide more fiscal and tax support for local enterprises, including extending the principal moratorium arrangements to allow companies to delay their loan payments for a longer time.
 <br>
  <br>
  This was among an array of proposals it put forward to the administration on Thursday ahead of the financial budget next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  With Donald Trump set to return to the White House next week, Lo said more efforts are needed to diversify businesses to minimise the impact of possible tariffs and Sino-US tensions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us. So the international market is no longer only the States and Europe. We should look for other business economies for a better future."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chipmaking giant TSMC on Thursday announced a better-than-expected net profit for the fourth quarter as it benefits from booming demand for AI technology.
 <br>
  <br>
  The company is the world's largest contract maker of chips that are used in everything from Apple's iPhones to Nvidia's cutting-edge artificial intelligence hardware.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm said net profit for the three months to December jumped 57 percent on-year to NT$374.7 billion (US$11.4 billion).
  <br>
  <br>
  That was better than the NT$369.8 billion forecast by analysts, and underscores expectations for sustained spending on AI infrastructure from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Net revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38.8 percent to NT$868.46 billion, TMSC said, beating forecasts. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Vietnam government said late on Wednesday that it would consider removing regulatory hurdles to allow aircraft manufactured by Chinese state-owned planemaker COMAC to operate in the country.
 <br>
  <br>
  COMAC is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to leading planemakers, Airbus and Boeing. Right now, its two passenger plane models currently operate almost exclusively within mainland China, and the company seeks to expand its presence in international markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before an airline can operate any aircraft model, it must receive approval from the national aviation regulator.
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha assigned the transport ministry to review existing rules to remove regulatory hurdles to enable COMAC planes to operate in Vietnam, the government said in a statement, after a meeting in Hanoi between Ha and COMAC Board Director Tan Wangeng.
  <br>
  <br>
  COMAC has been eyeing Vietnam as a potential market for some time, and conducted a Southeast Asia marketing tour last February, during which it flew two demonstration planes to the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ha said as an initial step low-cost carrier VietJet, Vietnam's leading private airline, may work with a Chinese airline operating COMAC planes to test aircraft on some routes. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks jumped on Wednesday, reversing a recent decline as traders responded enthusiastically to strong bank earnings and data indicating a slowdown in underlying inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.7 percent at 43,221, while the broad-based S&P 500 jumped 1.8 percent to 5,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The day's largest gains came in the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which surged by 2.5 percent to end the day at 19,511.
  <br>
  <br>
  US financial heavyweights including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported soaring profits Wednesday propelled by strength in trading and financial advisory services.
  <br>
  <br>
  And fresh data showed headline inflation rose in the 12 months to December, but actually eased once volatile food and energy prices were stripped out, fueling optimism in the markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of relief from the (inflation) data this morning," Angelo Kourkafas from Edward Jones told AFP, noting there had been a positive reaction in the markets to the decline in the so-called "core" inflation measure.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on long-dated US Treasurys including the popular two- and 10-year notes dropped sharply as investors piled back into bonds and pushed up prices, which move inversely to yields.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual firms, Tesla's shares soared by 8.0 percent, as did those of Bank of New York Mellon after it reported strong quarterly earnings results. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Wednesday said it "firmly opposes" a US move to effectively bar Chinese technology from smart cars in the American market, saying alleged risks to national security were "without any factual basis".
 <br>
  <br>
  "Such actions disrupt economic and commercial cooperation between enterprises... and represent typical protectionism and economic coercion," Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said, adding: "China firmly opposes this."
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's announcement in the United States, which also pertains to Russian technology, came as the Biden administration wrapped up efforts to increase American tech curbs, and after a months-long regulatory process.
  <br>
  <br>
  US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that modern vehicles contain cameras, microphones, GPS tracking and other technologies connected to the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cars today aren't just steel on wheels -- they're computers," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Guo slammed the move, telling journalists in Beijing that China would "take necessary measures" to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I want to say is that the US, citing so-called national security, has restricted the use of Chinese connected vehicle software, hardware, and entire vehicles in the United States without any factual basis," said Guo.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China urges the US to stop the erroneous practice of over generalising national security and to stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies." (AFP/Xinhua)

    Elon Musk sued over late disclosure of Twitter stake

<div class="itemFullText">
 Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.
  <br>
  <br>
  Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.
  <br>
  <br>
  Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.
  <br>
  <br>
  In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that "all indications" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)

    US TikTok users flock to Chinese app Xiaohongshu

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 As the threat of a TikTok ban looms in the United States, users there are flocking to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu - making it the top downloaded app in the US.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.
  <br>
  <br>
  The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.
  <br>
  <br>
  An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)

 Wall Street stocks were mixed after a choppy session as traders digested better-than-expected inflation data and looked ahead to bank earnings.
 <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future," Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds," said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A British computer scientist on Tuesday urged countries to prioritise cooperation when it comes to the issue of safety in the development of artificial intelligence.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.
  <br>
  <br>
  When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible," he said. "Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension."
  <br>
  <br>
  He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?" he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.
  <br>
  <br>
  The two-day financial forum hosted some 3,600 policymakers and business leaders from more than 50 countries and regions.
