 The Hong Kong stock market opened lower on Tuesday, with some investors apparently nervous ahead of a rate review in the United States.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index fell 0.59 percent to 19,678.03 in the opening minutes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The tech-rich Nasdaq surged to a fresh record Monday at the start of a heavy week of economic news that includes a US Federal Reserve rate decision.
 <br>
  <br>
  Large gains by chip company Broadcom, Google parent Alphabet and some other tech names helped lift the index 1.2 percent to 20,173.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 percent to 43,717, while the broad-based S&P 500 advanced 0.4 percent to 6,074.
  <br>
  <br>
  Adam Sarhan of 50 Park Investments pointed to SoftBank's announcement that it would invest US$100 billion in the United States as being supportive of tech shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's renewed optimism in semiconductor and big tech stocks," Sarhan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said the market may take a breather until it receives key data points later in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's a lot to digest this week," Ablin said of a calendar that includes key retail sales and inflation data, as well as a Fed monetary policy decision. (AFP)

    Trump, SoftBank CEO announce US$100 billion investment

<img alt="Donald Trump (right) and Masayoshi Son (left) say a planned investment by Softbank will create about 100,000 US jobs. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783752_1_20241217022004.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President-elect Donald Trump, with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at his side, announced on Monday that SoftBank would invest US$100 billion in the United States over the next four years.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump said in his joint appearance with Son that the investment would create 100,000 jobs focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and related infrastructure, with the money to be deployed before the end of Trump's term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said the investment was evidence of "monumental confidence in America's future."
  <br>
  <br>
  The US$100 billion pledge, made at a flag-bedecked event at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, fits in with Trump's vow to bolster the US economy and reduce the effect of inflation on Americans during his second term, which begins on January 20.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump called Son "one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Monday announcement echoes a similar pledge Son made with then-President-elect Trump in December 2016 at Trump Tower, when Son said he would spend US$50 billion and create 50,000 jobs.
  <br>
  <br>
  While that money was eventually spent, it is unclear whether those jobs were created. The company has been rebuilding its finances after the failure of high-flying office-sharing start-up WeWork and after investors soured on some of the tech firms that it's invested in through its Vision Fund unit.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's unclear how SoftBank plans to fund the new investment. As of September 30, SoftBank had about US$29 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its most recent earnings report. After a sharp decline in shares between 2021 and 2023, its stock has recovered, gaining nearly 50 percent year-to-date. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales of consumer goods went up three percent year on year to hit 4.38 trillion yuan in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  That was down from a 4.8 percent rise recorded in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last month, retail sales of consumer goods in urban regions rose 2.9 percent to 3.76 trillion yuan, while sales in rural regions stood at 616.7 billion yuan, up 3.2 percent, NBS data showed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The NBS also said the national urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at five percent in November.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industrial production growth stayed broadly flat at 5.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has unveiled a string of aggressive measures in recent months aimed at boosting economic growth, including cutting interest rates, cancelling restrictions on homebuying and easing the debt burden on local governments. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of the government's investment vehicle on Sunday said the corporation will take on more projects and expand strategic partnerships next year to boost Hong Kong's economy and competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br>
  Clara Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Investment Corporation, told a radio programme that she will reach out to overseas companies that have cutting-edge technology and research capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wholly owned by the government, the corporation's mission is to attract foreign talent and businesses to the SAR while helping successful local brands expand globally, Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We need to make sure every dollar we invest creates the most value for Hong Kong. When evaluating potential investments, we look at two key things that align with our dual mission," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "First, we examine if the business meets our financial and operational requirements. Second, we evaluate their contributions and commitments to Hong Kong, including how they benefit the economy and the public."
  <br>
  <br>
  The new energy industry is showing great potential and the corporation is helping companies in the field tap into Southeast Asian markets, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said the companies they have invested in are doing better than expected, including an AI research centre at the University of Science and Technology which has attracted internationally renowned scholars.

<img alt="Wall Street ended the session mixed, with traders unnerved by rising bond yields. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1783440_1_20241214071030.jpg&q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets finished a lacklustre week on a muted note on Friday as concerns about rising Treasury bond yields competed with enthusiasm over artificial intelligence equities.
 <br>
  <br>
  Of the major indices, only the Nasdaq mustered a gain in Friday's session. The index was also the only of the three leading US benchmarks to conclude the week higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Equities are kind of treading water," said LBBW's Karl Haeling. "A negative influence to some extent is the rise in bond yields."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest US consumer price index data released this week showed prices ticked higher in November and the wholesale data also showed stubborn inflationary pressures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Yields rose to their highest levels in over two weeks as markets brace for the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year, reflecting concerns over sticky inflation," said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
  <br>
  <br>
  There is also growing concern over the inflationary pressures from President-elect Donald Trump's pledges to cut taxes and impose tariffs, as inflation still stands above the Fed's target.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While the markets still anticipate a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week, the likelihood of a move in January has dropped," said Patrick Munnelly, partner at broker Tickmill Group.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CME FedWatch tool shows the market sees a more than 75 percent chance that the Fed will hold rates steady in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Europe, the Paris CAC 40 index ended the day down 0.2 percent after French President Emmanuel Macron named his centrist ally Francois Bayrou as prime minister, ending days of deadlock over finding a replacement for Michel Barnier.
  <br>
  <br>
  Frankfurt also dipped, with Germany's central bank sharply downgrading its growth forecasts on Friday for 2025 and 2026. It predicted a prolonged period of weakness for Europe's biggest economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  London stocks were also lower after official data showed that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank for the second consecutive month in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  The euro recovered after flirting with two-year lows against the US dollar following a warning Thursday by ECB president Christine Lagarde that the eurozone economy was "losing momentum", cautioning that "the risk of greater friction in global trade could weigh on euro area growth". (AFP)

 The Hang Seng Index ended the week on Friday sharply lower, finishing down 2.09 percent to close at 19,971, its biggest decline in a month.
 <br>
  <br>
  Stocks on the mainland recorded their heaviest losses in three weeks on Friday despite Thursday's pledge from the Central Economic Work Conference to increase the budget deficit and maintain economic growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in the week, the Politburo said it would switch to an "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and increase fiscal support in 2025. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US equity markets dipped fell on Thursday, with the Nasdaq retreating below 20,000 following a US inflation report that topped expectations.
 <br>
  <br>
  US wholesale inflation came in at 0.4 percent last month, seasonally adjusted, up from 0.3 percent in October and higher than projected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the inflation report, markets continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now we're seeing profit-taking after a big day," said Sam Burns, chief strategist at Mill Street Research, who viewed the inflation report as unlikely to shift the Fed's thinking.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq Composite Index, which closed above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, dropped 0.7 percent to 19,902.84.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5 percent to 43,914.12, while the S&P 500 also shed 0.5 percent to 6,051.25.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock indices have scored repeat records since Donald Trump won the November 5 presidential election. The Republican took a victory lap on Thursday morning, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Adobe tumbled 13.7 percent on disappointment over the software giant's forecast for next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Warner Bros. Discovery surged 15.4 percent as it announced a reorganization, with one major division focused on operating television networks and the other focused on streaming and movie studios. (AFP)

 China on Thursday vowed to boost domestic consumption next year, state media said, as leaders concluded a key economic policy meeting.
 <br>
  <br>
  Top leaders at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), including President Xi Jinping, pledged to implement a "moderately loose" monetary policy, increase social financing and reduce interest rates "at the right time", according to state broadcaster CCTV.
  <br>
  <br>
  Senior policymakers also laid out several "key tasks" to be carried out next year, including "vigorously" boosting consumption, stabilising foreign trade and halting the real estate market's fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The adverse impact brought by changes in the external environment has deepened," CCTV said following the closed-door CEWC, adding however that the upward trend of China’s economy remains unchanged.
  <br>
  <br>
  A separate readout from state news agency Xinhua, meanwhile, kept a pledge to "maintain the basic stability of the exchange rate at a reasonable and balanced level".

    'HK exports to see 4 percent growth in 2025'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s exports will grow by four percent in the next year, according to a forecast by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC).
 <br>
  <br>
  The council on Thursday said with US president-elect Donald Trump taking office next month, global trading conditions may change drastically and Hong Kong will also be affected.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the US has announced is not just tariffs on the Hong Kong or mainland-origin goods, but more towards its major trading partners. That would be potentially a significant negative impact on global trade," HKTDC's director of research Irina Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said some exporters arranged front-loading of shipments recently due to the uncertainties, so exports in the first half of 2025 are expected to be stronger than in the second half.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It could be like... you have a quite booming first half, but into the second half, given we have front-loading behaviour already starting this quarter, we could have a very sluggish fourth quarter," Fan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The HKTDC said Hong Kong's exports grew by about 10 percent in the first 10 months of this year, and a strong recovery of electronics exports largely attributed to the growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said electronics had a more than 70 percent share of the city's merchandise exports, marking a 13 percent increase year-on-year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said electronics will continue to play an important role in the SAR's exports next year, given the consistent demand for AI-enabled systems.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a mixed session on Wednesday, with a rally in Google's parent company Alphabet spurring the tech-rich Nasdaq to end the day above 20,000 for the first time.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slipped 0.2 percent to close at 44,148, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 6,084.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq was the day's big winner, jumping 1.8 percent to close at a new record of 20,034, after Alphabet reported it had made a breakthrough in quantum computing.
  <br>
  <br>
  The news sent the firm's share price soaring, with its class A shares closing up 5.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were also digesting the news that consumer inflation ticked higher last month, largely in line with expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The investors are reacting positively to the latest inflation data for two reasons," said Adam Sarhan from 50 Park Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Number one, it gives the Fed more room to continue with easy money, cutting rates," he said. "And then number two, it allows more room for the economy to grow without the threat of inflation picking up." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished lower on Tuesday as markets paused from a post-election rally, while Google parent Alphabet surged on what it called a "major" technology announcement.
 <br>
  <br>
  After winning numerous records in the weeks since the November 5 presidential election, US stocks have fallen the last two days amid caution ahead of key inflation data.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Alphabet jumped 5.3 percent after Google showed off a new quantum computing chip that it described as a significant breakthrough in the field that it said could lead to advances in drug discovery, fusion energy and other areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.4 percent at 44.247.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 declined 0.3 percent to 6,034, while the tech-rich Nasdaq also fell 0.3 percent to 19,687.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses come ahead of Thursday's consumer price index, which will be closely scrutinised by the Federal Reserve. The US central bank is expected to cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Walgreens Boots Alliance soared 17.7 percent following reports that it could be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing jumped 4.5 percent as it announced it was resuming production at two Seattle-area plants that had been shuttered for nearly three months due to a labour strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oracle slumped 6.7 percent after reporting lower-than-expected profits despite "extraordinary" growth in the artificial intelligence segment of the company's infrastructure business.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Alaska Air Group surged 13.2 percent as it unveiled a medium-term outlook that promised "at least" US$10 earnings per share in 2027. In 2023, the airline company earned US1.83 per share. (AFP)

 Hong Kong stocks ended lower on Tuesday, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index down 0.5 percent at 20,311.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Shanghai Composite Index finished up 0.6 percent at 3,422, while the Shenzhen Component Index closed 0.8 percent higher at 10,812.
  <br>
  <br>
  Raymond Yeung, the chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy on Monday has sent a positive signal to the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Now, the market has been excited in the last 24 hours after the Politburo statement. But obviously, it's just a change of wording that creates a lot of imagination," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It basically implies that the central bank is willing to cut the interest rate more and to inject liquidity... From now towards the National People's Congress [meeting], the market will be expecting more consumption support in almost every holiday season."
  <br>
  <br>
  But Yeung said careful timing and execution are important given the ongoing tensions between Beijing and Washington. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<img alt="Official figures show Chinese exports grew 6.7 percent in November from a year earlier. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782832_1_20241210141802.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese exports rose in November at a slower rate than expected while imports shrunk further, official data showed on Tuesday, reinforcing the need for more support a day after top officials pledged to bolster growth.
 <br>
  <br>
  Outbound shipments grew 6.7 percent last month, compared with a 12.7 percent rise in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Exports grew 5.4 percent on-year in January-November.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China's exports were perhaps the biggest upside surprise for the economy in 2024," wrote Lynn Song, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
  <br>
  <br>
  This is "one of the main reasons China is set to achieve its 'around five percent' growth target" for this year, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts say that the latest setbacks are likely to be temporary.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We expect exports to accelerate again in the coming months, supported by gains in export competitiveness and exporters front-running tariffs,” Huang Zichun of Capital Economics said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others pointed out that the recent spike in exports could be down to companies ramping up stockpiles amid fears of another China-US trade war when Donald Trump takes the White House next month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, imports shrank 3.9 percent, their worst performance in nine months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, attributed the poor import figure to falling commodity prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's trade surplus grew to US$97.44 billion last month, up from US$95.72 billion in October. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is embracing digital transformation in the insurance sector and taking steps to address growing challenges brought by climate change, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The CE was speaking at the Asian Insurance Forum, which drew more than 400 professionals in person and 1,800 online participants this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lee said the SAR is committed to supporting insurtech development through various initiatives, including the Insurtech Sandbox and Open API Framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These initiatives allow insurance providers to experiment with new business models, explore digital products and enhance customer experience in ways that were previously unimaginable," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's fast-evolving insurtech business is helping the industry embrace artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain, bringing tangible improvements to businesses as well as consumers."
  <br>
  <br>
  The CE added that the SAR is "at the forefront" in developing solutions to combat climate change with measures such as insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds.
  <br>
  <br>
  "To date, Hong Kong has issued five catastrophe bonds, raising more than US$700 million for protection against typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Technological innovation will be a key enabler of insurance industry growth," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong is home to about 160 authorised insurers, including six of the world's top 10 insurance firms, Lee added.

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index rose more than three percent in the opening minutes. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782809_1_20241210094938.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Shanghai stocks soared at the open on Tuesday after China's leadership said it would take a more "relaxed" approach to monetary policy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index jumped 3.2 percent, or 655 points, to 21,070, and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 2.6 percent, or 87 points, to 3,490.
  <br>
  <br>
  This followed Beijing's announcement of a looser monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal policy after a Politburo meeting on Monday, marking a shift from the country's rather prudent policy stance since 2011.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alain Groshens, the CEO of SystematicEdge, told RTHK's Money Talk programme that he believes the move will be a game changer.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is getting ready for the US to impose tariffs on China. There could be an additional maybe 10 percent, maybe up to 60 percent," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So the objective of these measures is really to boost Chinese domestic consumption, but also to stabilise the real estate market and the capital market... There will be a strong impact on the Chinese equity market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Groshens added that he expects China to achieve its growth target next year thanks to the new fiscal stimulus measures, projecting around 4.5 percent growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Richard Harris, CEO of Port Shelter Investment Management, told the same programme that he thinks China will focus more on fiscal policy and government spending going forward.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think rates are reasonably low, but I think they will really try and focus more on the fiscal side, how government directs its spending," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But the one thing that international observers have been critical of is the fact that a lot of this stimulus hasn't gone down to the consumer itself. I think people would quite like to see consumption vouchers, you know how much we love them in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  Harris said while Beijing has been trying to stimulate the economy for over a year, many investors have been "asleep at the wheel" in noticing these efforts.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said he hopes to see more direct support for people living in poverty, and consumption vouchers to boost domestic spending.
  <br>

  Meanwhile, mainland cosmetics giant Mao Geping jumped more than 70 percent on its first day of trading in Hong Kong. (AFP/RTHK)

<img alt="Wall Street finished lower, as Nvidia led the tech sector lower, and investors are also nervous ahead of inflation data. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782786_1_20241210052146.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The main US indices finished lower on Monday, fueled by a decline in AI leader Nvidia that weighed on tech stocks, as investors looked ahead to a crucial inflation report set for later this week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Nvidia fell after China's market regulator launched an investigation into the chipmaker over suspected violation of antimonopoly law, dragging down the information technology sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Advanced Micro Devices slipped after BofA Global Research downgraded its rating on the stock, weighing on the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market was taken a bit by surprise regarding China's investigating (Nvidia) as a possible antimonopoly-law violation. So that's one thing that's putting a little damper on the market," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 lost 37.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 6,052.35, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 123.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,736.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 240.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to 44,401.93.
  <br>
  <br>
  Comcast declined after forecasting a loss of more than 100,000 broadband subscribers in the fourth quarter, denting the communication services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Hershey soared following a report that Cadbury parent Mondelez was exploring an acquisition of the chocolate maker. Mondelez shares fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are anticipating the consumer price index (CPI) data set for release on Wednesday, along with the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday, ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Dec. 17-18.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, emphasized caution regarding the central bank's approach to easing monetary policy due to the economy's resilience.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street's main indexes started December on a positive note, with the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both gaining in their first week, while the blue-chip Dow ended the week slightly lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks soared in November after Donald Trump won the presidential election and his party secured control of both houses of Congress, raising expectations for a more business-friendly policy agenda. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Air India has placed an order to buy 100 more Airbus aircraft, the Tata Group-owned carrier said on Monday, in a deal aimed at bolstering its fleet and winning over flyers.
 <br>
  <br>
  The airline said the deal consisted of 10 widebody A350 and 90 narrowbody A320 family aircraft.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new purchase, the company said in a statement, is "in addition" to the orders for 470 aircraft Air India placed with Airbus and Boeing last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  When the two deals were announced, it was the largest order unveiled at the same time by a commercial carrier, with list price calculations for the jets suggesting an estimated value north of US$70 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The latest order takes the total number of aircraft that Air India ordered with Airbus in 2023 from 250 aircraft, comprising 40 A350 and 210 A320 family aircraft, to 350," the carrier said in a statement, without giving price details on the latest order.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since taking over the former national carrier in 2022, the sprawling Tata Group conglomerate has sought to turn around the loss-making airline by ordering new aircraft and upgrading its existing fleet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said the airline saw a "clear case" for Air India to expand its future fleet beyond the 470 aircraft ordered in 2023.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These additional 100 Airbus aircraft will help to position Air India on the path to greater growth and contribute to our mission of building Air India into a world-class airline that connects India to every corner of the world," Chandrasekaran said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement that he was pleased by Air India's latest investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Having personally witnessed the formidable growth of the Indian aviation sector... I am glad to see Air India renew its trust in Airbus with this additional order," he said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and other senior officials on Monday said the country would implement a more proactive fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy next year.
 <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came after the Politburo of the Communist Party of China Central Committee met to analyse and study the economic work of 2025 and arrange Party conduct and anti-corruption work.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to state media, a meeting statement noted it was "necessary to enrich and improve the policy toolkit, strengthen unconventional counter-cyclical adjustments, intensify the coordination of various policies, and make the macro regulation more forward-looking, targeted and effective."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We must vigorously boost consumption, improve investment efficiency, and comprehensively expand domestic demand," state media quoted officials as having said.
  <br>
  <br>
  They also stressed the need to stabilise the stock and property markets, and managed risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next year we should... implement a more active fiscal policy and an appropriately relaxed monetary policy," they added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The statement also indicated the main goals and tasks for economic and social development in 2024 would be successfully accomplished. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, was up 0.2 percent year on year in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The figure was down from the 0.3-percent increase registered in October, largely due to slower food price rises, said NBS chief statistician Dong Lijuan.
  <br>
  <br>
  The national average temperature in November was the highest for any comparable period since 1961, which supported production and transportation of agricultural goods, helping bring fresh food prices down, Dong said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3 percent from a year ago in November, up from 0.2 percent in October.
  <br>
  <br>
  On a monthly basis, the CPI slipped 0.6 percent in November, following a 0.3-percent decrease in October.

 The Nasdaq and the S&P hit fresh records on Friday after the November US jobs report came in better than expected, with the Dow edging down.
 <br>
  <br>
  The world's biggest economy gained 227,000 jobs in November, up from a revised 36,000 in October, according to the Department of Labor.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's kind of being viewed as a Goldilocks jobs print," Tom Cahill from Ventura Wealth Management told AFP.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The jobs market is cooling, there's no question about that, but it's still relatively healthy," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished lower, shedding 0.3 percent to close at 44,642.52.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P rose 0.3 percent to close at a new record of 6,090.27, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.8 percent to finish at a fresh high of 19,859.77.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was a good day for tech titans, with Amazon and Facebook owner Meta closing up 2.9 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  UnitedHealthcare's shares fell 5.1 percent after the markets digested the news that its chief executive had been killed in a shooting in New York in the early hours of Wednesday. (AFP)

<img alt="Bitcoin broke US$100,000 for the first time as traders cheered Donald Trump's decision to pick a crypto fan to head the US securities regulator. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782207_1_20241205124359.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Bitcoin topped the US$100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump as US president rolls on.
 <br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes just hours after the president-elect signalled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry with his choice of Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to nominate Atkins, a former SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from US$69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as US$101,512 Wednesday, just two years after dropping below US$17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
  <br>
  <br>
  How long bitcoin will stay above the coveted US$100,000 mark is uncertain.
  <br>
  <br>
  As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records on Wednesday, extending a post-election rally on optimism about more interest rate cuts and an artificial intelligence boom after strong Salesforce results.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices scored records, led by the Dow Jones, which finished above 45,000 for the first time.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market at this point is looking for excuses to go up, and there's not really anything that might work against that narrative," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Over the last couple of days, it's managed to ignore all sorts of inconvenient things," Sosnick said of the market's shrugging response to political upheaval in France and South Korea.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 0.7 percent at 45,014.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent to 6,086, its fourth straight record, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.3 percent to 19,735, its third straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's gains came after payroll firm ADP said US private-sector hiring in November came in at a lower-than-expected 146,000 jobs, while a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed weaker sentiment than expected in the services sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the lacklustre data boosts expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a New York conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell refrained from tipping his hand, but he "didn't say anything that would scare the market," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare noted that Wednesday's gains were led by large tech names such as Nvidia and Microsoft, which are major AI players.
  <br>
  <br>
  The boost followed strong results from Salesforce, which was the biggest gainer in the Dow with an 11 percent jump. (AFP)

    Bank of Korea to provide liquidity to support markets

<img alt="The Bank of Korea reassured investors it would take all necessary steps to stabilise the markets. File photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1782037_1_20241204122024.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea said it would provide "sufficient liquidity" to support its financial markets on Wednesday after the country was rocked by President Yoon Suk-yeol's brief imposition of martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  Equities sank more than two percent in Seoul and the won initially plunged to a two-year low against the US dollar after the dramatic move, which stunned traders already concerned about the state of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a bid to limit the fallout from the crisis, the country's central bank and finance ministry moved to reassure markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As announced together with the government, it has been decided to temporarily supply sufficient liquidity until the financial and foreign exchange markets stabilise," the Bank of Korea said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that "the range of securities eligible for (repo) transactions and the target institutions will be expanded".
  <br>
  <br>
  Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who is also the Minister of Economy and Finance, said financial authorities will keep international partners informed about developments.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In order to ease concerns about our economic situation, we will closely communicate with international credit rating agencies, major countries such as the US, domestic economic organisations and financial markets, and share the situation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In addition, we will operate a 24-hour economic and financial situation inspection task force to operate a real-time monitoring system to prevent a real-time economic shock, and we will thoroughly monitor with relevant organisations to prevent any disruptions in exports."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added "the government will also do its best to ensure that the uncertainty facing our economy is quickly resolved".
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had made the shock decision, which took Seoul's global allies by off guard, "to safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness".

  However, he backed down hours later when lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, while thousands of protesters took to the streets and the nation's largest umbrella labour union called an "indefinite general strike" until Yoon resigned.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts warned that while the U-turn meant the impact of the night's extraordinary events would be tempered, the country could still face further turmoil in the economy, with worries about US President-elect Donald Trump trade policy also causing concern.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a macro perspective, South Korea was already one of the more vulnerable countries to the impact of Trump's proposed tariffs," said MUFG's senior currency analyst Michael Wan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This recent development could raise some further risk premium on the currency at least until we get clarity on political stability." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Seoul stock exchange fell 2 percent at the opening on Wednesday before limiting its losses in early trading, after President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared then lifted martial law overnight.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Kospi composite index tumbled to 2,450 points as trading opened while shares in the country's biggest company Samsung Electronics slid 3 percent before paring losses about half an hour later to 1.12 percent down.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Korean won lost 2.5 percent against the greenback overnight to 1,444.09 against the dollar, its weakest level in two years.
  <br>
  <br>
  It later regained ground at the start of Asian trading, ahead of an extraordinary meeting called by the South Korean central bank to "discuss the situation related to the declaration of martial law and market stabilisation measures."
  <br>
  <br>
  At 0030 GMT, it was trading at 1,414.49 won against the dollar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's stocks started the day cautiously, with blue-chip Nikkei down 0.11 percent to 39,205 points at the open. (AFP)

<img alt="A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October. Photo: AFP" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781978_1_20241204054412.jpg&q=85">

<div class="itemFullText">
 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh records with narrow gains on Tuesday as markets reacted to mixed labour market data that kept alive the possibility of another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major indices have been notching regular records following the US presidential election, spawning talk that markets are now overvalued.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There's not a whole lot of natural drivers of new money coming into the market at this point," said Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners, adding that markets appear "biased to the upside" in light of a benign 2025 financial outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.2 percent at 44,705.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the S&P 500 added 0.1 percent at 6,049, a third straight record, while the Nasdaq climbed 0.4 percent to 19,480, scoring its second straight record.
  <br>
  <br>
  A closely-watched labour market report showed an increase in job openings in October, but also a decline in new job postings during the month, a less upbeat sign.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the data overall provides "good grounds" for the Fed to lower interest rates again this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets lifted the odds of another rate cut by the US central bank on December 17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, AT&T jumped 4.6 percent as it announced US$40 billion in shareholder give-backs at an investor day where it projected revenue and operating earnings growth over the next three years.
  <br>
  <br>
  United States Steel sank 8.0 percent after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated a pledge to block a takeover of the company by Japan's Nippon Steel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla dropped 1.6 percent after a US judge upheld her decision to reject Elon Musk's massive US$55.8 billion compensation package, concluding the electric car company's shareholder vote to reinstate the plan did not override her initial ruling. (AFP)

    South Korean currency drops after martial law declared

<img alt="Policemen stand in front of the gate to the National Assembly after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. Photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781957_1_20241203231014.jpg&q=75">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The South Korean won dropped to a more than two-year low against the US dollar on Tuesday, while exchange traded funds linked to South Korean stocks fell after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in an unannounced late-night address live on YTN television.
 <br>
  <br>
  The South Korean unit fell to as low as 1,430.82 won per dollar, the lowest since October 2022. It was last down 1.9 percent at 1,430.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's uncertainty driven.. one of those 'shoot first, ask questions later' (moves)," said Christopher Wong, FX and rates strategist at OCBC in Singapore. "Given the lack of information, the uncertainty may still keep Korean won under pressure in the interim."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yoon said he had no choice but to resort to such a measure in order to safeguard free and constitutional order, saying opposition parties have taken the parliamentary process hostage to throw the country into a crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks listed overseas swooned. The MSCI South Korea ETF fell 4.5 percent, while the Franklin FTSE South Korea ETF slid 3.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  With losses of more than 9 percent so far this year, the won is one of Asia's worst performers and has been persistently under pressure as the Bank of Korea cut rates aggressively to support the economy and as investors fled a market they see as exposed heavily to exports and to US trade tariffs on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Korean won is already under pressure from the looming threat of tariffs and their detrimental impact on export-driven economies," said Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager in the fixed income team at Eastspring Investments in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This latest development is likely to exacerbate the currency’s weakness, encouraging speculators to use the won as a high-beta proxy for expressing tariff-related risks." (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks had a strong day on Monday, the first trading day in December, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 closing at fresh record highs, and the Dow dipping slightly.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the only major Wall Street index to fall on Monday, dipping 0.3 percent to close at 44,782.00.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to close at a new record of 6,047.15, while the Nasdaq rose 1.0 percent to an all-time high of 19,403.95.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From a technical standpoint, the market is still in very good shape," Jack Ablin from Cresset Capital told AFP. "And December also coincides with... a favourable seasonal trend as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're just getting back to a mega cap growth stocks again," Ablin said. "And it may be because investors don't expect rates to come down as quickly as they originally thought."
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin said the market was favouring those companies because they have "no debt or very little debt."
  <br>
  <br>
  "And so when they think rates are going to stay high, then they want the companies that aren't borrowing much," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual stocks, Super Micro Computer surged 28.7 percent after a probe into an auditor's concerns about governance and transparency issues found "no evidence" of misconduct at the firm.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another firm to rise was chip manufacturing equipment firm Applied Materials, which saw its share price rise by 4.9 percent. (AFP)

 The local stock market ended higher on Monday with the benchmark Hang Seng Index up 0.65 percent to close at 19,550.

  <br>
  Analysts said the gains were driven by encouraging manufacturing data and expectations of continued policy support from Beijing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sentiment was buoyed by data that showed China's factory activity expanded last month, with Beijing's stimulus blitz since September starting to trickle through.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the resumption of multi-entry permits for Shenzhen residents visiting Hong Kong will boost the local tourism, retail and catering industries.
 <br>
  <br>
  From Sunday, more than 10 million people in Shenzhen will be allowed to visit the SAR as many times as they like, reversing a policy that limited such trips to once per week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will make it easier for people to travel and strengthen economic ties between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
  <br>
  <br>
  A series of measures by the central government to support the SAR's tourism and efforts by local shops and restaurants to improve their services will boost the Hong Kong economy, Chan added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong's economy has shown moderate overall growth this year, but consumption and export of services still need further improvement," he wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief also noted that the new three-runway system at the airport and plans to increase international destinations will consolidate the city's position as an international aviation hub.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sri Lanka's consumer prices fell by 2.1 percent in November, the highest deflation rate recorded by the economically fragile island nation since 1961, official data showed on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br>
  An unprecedented financial crash in 2022 brought months of consumer goods shortages, with inflation peaking at nearly 70 percent that year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since then, a US$2.9 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund, tax hikes and other austerity measures have slowly made headway in repairing the island's economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Headline inflation will remain negative in the next few months, deeper than previously projected, mainly due to larger downward adjustments in energy prices and reduction in volatile food prices," Sri Lanka's central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank said inflation was likely to return to its target level of five percent in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sri Lanka had already seen deflation of 0.8 percent in October and 0.5 percent in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was elected in September, has vowed to maintain the IMF bailout programme negotiated by his predecessor that includes higher taxes and cuts to state spending. (AFP)

    China's PMI rises for second consecutive month

<img alt="Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781508_1_20241130110608.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's factory activity expanded modestly for a second straight month in November, an official survey showed, adding to a string of recent data suggesting stimulus measures are having an impact on the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index (PMI) on Saturday rose to 50.3 - a seven-month high - from 50.1 in October, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and beating a median forecast of 50.2 in a Reuters poll.
  <br>
  <br>
  Two months of positive PMI readings suggest the stimulus announcements are improving sentiment on factory floors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economy stabilized recently as fiscal and monetary policies eased after the Politburo meeting on September 26. But the outlook for 2025 remains unclear," said Zhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI report showed total new orders expanded for the first time in seven months in November, while new export orders contracted for the seventh consecutive month.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PMI index continued to rise in November, indicating more obvious signs of recovery at the bottom of the economy. The effect of policies in boosting business confidence is becoming stronger," said Zhang Liqun, an analyst at the China Logistics Information Center.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, "insufficient demand is still a major constraint on enterprise production activities," said Zhang. "It is necessary especially to strengthen the effective driving of government public investment on enterprise orders."
  <br>
  <br>
  The non-manufacturing PMI, which includes construction and services, fell to 50.0 this month, after it rose to 50.2 in October. Activity in the services sector expanded modestly for a second month in a row.
  <br>
  <br>
  The private sector Caixin factory survey will be released on Monday and analysts expect its reading to edge up to 50.5.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier this month, China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan debt package to ease municipal financing strains. That followed China's central bank in September introducing its biggest stimulus since the pandemic to pull the economy back towards the governments growth target of around 5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's official November composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained at 50.8 in November. (Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US markets ended a holiday-shortened session higher as the US Black Friday shopping spree gathered steam and traders speculated whether President-elect Donald Trump may back off from his threatened tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The yen rallied against the US dollar as higher inflation in Japan fueled expectations that the central bank will hike interest rates again.
  <br>
  <br>
  Traders are closing out a rollercoaster month for assets caused largely by Trump winning a second US presidential election -- and also a result of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are tracking developments surrounding Trump's pledge to hammer China, Canada and Mexico with hefty tariffs on his first day in office in January.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stock markets closed higher on a shortened trading day, with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting fresh records following Thursday's Thanksgiving break.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 percent to 44,910.65, the S&P 500 closed up 0.6 percent at 6,032.38 and the Nasdaq gained 0.8 percent to 19,218.17.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chip companies notched gains after a news report that President Joe Biden's administration was mulling further curbs on semiconductor equipment sales to China that were less severe than anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Nvidia closed 2.2 percent up.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be "cruising along here without any interference," said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Paris and Frankfurt stock markets closed higher, and London finished with more modest gains.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With many US investors still out after being off for Thanksgiving yesterday, the key theme that has emerged in the last few days is the easing of tariff fears," said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and Forex.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  This came after a phone call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who afterwards said: "There will not be a potential tariff war."
  <br>
  <br>
  The focus was also on shoppers seeking bargains on Black Friday, a crucial day for retailers around the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  O'Hare said Black Friday has become less of a "frenetic rush" given the popularity of online shopping now -- although there is still a lot of attention on the retail space. (AFP)

<img alt="New World Development has appointed a second CEO in a little more than two months. File photo: RTHK" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1781463_1_20241129211925.jpg&q=85">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New World Development announced on Friday that Chief Executive Officer Eric Ma has resigned with immediate effect, just a little more than two months into the job.
 <br>
  <br>
  Echo Huang, who's the head of the group's property business in mainland China, has been named as his replacement.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a filing to the local bourse, the developer said Ma, who was also the executive director, wished to pursue "other personal commitments".
  <br>
  <br>
  The former development chief took over from scion Adrian Cheng in September, after the company reported a net loss of more than HK$17 billion the previous financial year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cheng's father and the developer's chairman, Henry Cheng, said "timely phased changes needed to be made" after reviewing the group's development direction.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added he was glad to have found a "more suitable" CEO, citing Huang's experience in real estate and corporate management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company also appointed Gilbert Ho and Edward Lau as executive directors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of New World Development and sister company, New World Department Store China, fell by around six percent before trading was halted in the afternoon pending the personnel announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trading for both firms will resume on Monday.

    Ocean Park sees deficit despite visitor, income surge

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park has recorded a deficit of more than HK$71 million for the financial year ending in June, despite revenue and visitor numbers hitting five-year highs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Announcing its results on Thursday, the theme park also said it will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas to drive park attendance and income.
  <br>
  <br>
  From December 8, the public will get to meet two pandas sent by the central government as gifts to the SAR, followed by locally-bred twin cubs as early as February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will capitalise on the presence of six giant pandas in the park to drive citywide excitement, thereby increasing visitor numbers and revenue while promoting panda tourism and ecological conservation in Hong Kong," said Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the 2023-24 fiscal year, the theme park's total revenue increased 41 percent year-on-year to HK$1.18 billion, primarily driven by a 54 percent growth in admission income.
  <br>
  <br>
  Revenue from merchandise jumped 27 percent, while catering income rose 32 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The park also welcomed 33 percent more visitors at 3.14 million in 2023-24, when compared with the same period last year. Visitors from the mainland, India and the Philippines showed significant year-on-year growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Still, the theme park recorded a financial deficit of HK$71.6 million in the period ending June 30.
  <br>
  <br>
  Excluding government subsidies and depreciation, its net operating loss narrowed for a third straight year to HK$297 million, with the park saying the figure reflected "sustained upward momentum in operations and business performance" with cost-saving and revenue-generating measures in place.
  <br>
  <br>
  As of the end of June, the park's bank balance and cash totalled roughly HK$1.66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to pursue diverse revenue sources and aim for continued improvement in our financial performance over the medium to long term, despite prevailing external economic uncertainties. Through our operating income, we seek to contribute to society, future generations, and environmental conservation, thereby reducing reliance on public finances," Pong said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A property analyst says housing prices are bottoming out and should stabilise next year, with possible growth of under five percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hannah Jeong, head of valuation and advisory services at CBRE, was commenting after official data showed that home prices went up in October after declining for five months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed private residential prices were up 0.6 percent month-on-month. In September, prices dropped to their lowest level in eight years.
  <br>
  <br>
  Rents in October recorded their first fall since February, falling 0.3 percent month-on-month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong said the major reasons for the upswing in prices were local banks lowering their prime rates after the US central bank began cutting interest rates in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government relaxing the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for all residential properties to 70 percent, regardless of the value of the property and whether it is for self-occupation, also had an impact, she added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think we only have three or two months to go. So the decline or the overall negative growth will continue within this year," Jeong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But 2025, possibly we are bottoming out and then see slight positive growth, possibly less than five percent, or remain stable or flat. So that's the forecast for 2025."
  <br>
  <br>
  The analyst noted the rental market was performing quite well, with a yield reaching about 3.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said she expected this upward trend to continue in 2025, due to the number of people entering the city under various government talent schemes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jeong also said there was a very strong desire for home ownership in Hong Kong, and next year, when the supply of new flats was expected to peak at around 26,000, this would provide a good opportunity for potential homebuyers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So I think we are facing the supply peak, obviously, at the wrong time. But this will give a good opportunity to homebuyers. People were waiting a very long time and unfortunately during Covid, people thought the market will be soft. But we had a 2020 price peak and people are losing money, whoever bought at that moment," she explained.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So now people learned a lesson and expect that if the price is much more affordable at this moment, people want to have a home."
  <br>
  <br>
  She also said developers were keen to get rid of their new units and were offering good incentives in the first-hand market.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks declined on Wednesday, retreating from records after pricing data showed an uptick in inflation, as leading companies fell after earnings reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  After three straight closing records for the Dow and Tuesday's record for the S&P 500, both dropped along with the Nasdaq in the final full trading session of the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished down 0.3 percent at 44,722.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent to 5,998, while the Nasdaq shed 0.6 percent to 19,060.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite Wednesday's lacklustre session, investors are optimistic about the upcoming period.
  <br>
  <br>
  A note from CFRA Research pointed out that December has historically been the strongest month of the year for the S&P 500 since World War II.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We project additional new highs through year-end as the S&P approaches our 6,145 target level," CFRA said in the note. "However, the year ahead could offer additional challenges, which will likely lead to a below-average full-year gain."
  <br>
  <br>
  The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months to October, up from 2.1 percent in September, the Commerce Department announced.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. Futures markets currently place the odds at about two-thirds that the Fed will cut interest rates again in December by a quarter of a percentage point.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, both Dell Technologies and HP Inc. fell sharply on disappointment with their profit outlooks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dell slumped 12.3 percent and HP lost 11.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Department store Nordstrom also retreated, sinking 8.2 percent as it reported a 4.6 percent increase in revenues. But the company also reported lower profits in a move attributed to higher costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets will be closed on Thursday and open for only a half-day on Friday. (AFP)
