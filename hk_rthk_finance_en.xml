  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed decidedly lower on Wednesday as investors adjusted their expectations for bold central bank interest rate cuts, while major tech names came under pressure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended 1.0 percent down at 42,514, while the S&P 500 slid 0.9 percent to 5,797.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq plunged 1.6 percent to 18,276.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The losses came as US Treasury yields climbed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The economic reports are such that people are losing faith in the idea that we're going to get aggressive rate cuts," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another possible reason for the increase in yields is the US presidential election outcome next month, he said, noting that "neither candidate is talking about anything resembling fiscal discipline."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There could be "nervousness" that inflation might creep back in, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major firms came under pressure as well, with tech giant Apple's shares down 2.2 percent and Nvidia shares losing 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fast food giant McDonald's slumped 5.1 percent amid a severe E coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Boeing closed 1.8 percent down after reporting a whopping US$6.2 billion quarterly loss as a labour strike bogged down its commercial plane division. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's industry chief told Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing on Wednesday that he hoped the US tech giant would continue to deepen its presence in the country, an official statement on their meeting showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped "Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market", according to a ministry statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jin also said he hoped Apple would "increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to expand high-level opening up," Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a "better environment" for global investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wednesday's meeting saw the two exchange views on topics including "Apple's development in China, network data security management, [and] cloud services", the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook is visiting China for the second time this year, a trip that has seen him meet with university students and try out the iPhone 16's camera in a historic Beijing district with fashion photographer Chen Man.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The firm fell to number six in a ranking of smartphone vendors in China during the second quarter of the year – from number three during the same period last year – according to analysis firm Canalys. (AFP)

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut

  <img alt="Proceeds from the Tokyo Metro IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775777_1_20241023103553.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks finished with little change on Tuesday, digesting a trove of mostly solid earnings while shrugging off higher treasury bond yields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After opening lower, major indices pushed into positive territory in the afternoon before losing steam after that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The market is just kind of grinding and not doing a whole lot," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's indicative of a market taking a step back."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended essentially unchanged at 42,924.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,851, while the Nasdaq added 0.2 percent at 18,573.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that there's a tension between the fact that yields are rising which obviously means that bonds are more competitive with stocks," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the other hand, it's also indicative that the economy might be stronger than we thought it may have been. So you have that tension there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, General Motors shot up around 10 percent as it raised its full-year forecast, reflecting strong vehicle pricing that boosted third-quarter earnings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But GE Aerospace slumped 9.1 percent despite increasing its annual projections amid strong demand. However, analysts pointed to lingering concerns connected to a Boeing strike that has shuttered two US plane production plants. (AFP)

    HSBC restructures operations in overhaul

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday it would combine its commercial and investment banking operations in a major overhaul under new CEO Georges Elhedery that has also seen key senior staff depart.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seeking to simplify the Asia-focused bank's business and reduce costs, HSBC said it would be restructuring into four business units and slashing senior management positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new leadership structure, which includes the appointment of Pam Kaur as the lender's first female chief financial officer, would "unleash our full potential and drive success into the future," Elhedery said in a memo to staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elhedery, like many bank executives, is under pressure to address climbing costs and better manage expenses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group is carving up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. The new corporate and institutional banking unit will house a newly combined commercial banking and global banking and markets business, and western wholesale banking businesses, including Europe and the Americas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kaur, 60, who currently serves as HSBC's chief risk and compliance officer, joined the bank in April 2013 as group head of internal audit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jon Bingham, interim Group CFO, will resume his role of Global Financial Controller, HSBC said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other key management changes, Greg Guyett, CEO Global Banking and Markets, will assume a newly created role of Chair, Strategic Clients Group. Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank and Europe, has decided to step down to pursue other opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank, which employs about 214,000 people globally, has been removing duplicate roles for years and reducing its businesses in Western markets such as the United States, France and Canada as it focuses on Asia and markets where it has scale. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Cathay Pacific has rolled out more than HK$100 billion in investments over the next seven years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775665_1_20241022160724.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 retreated from records on Monday as treasury bond yields rose in the first session of a heavy week of earnings reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Perhaps the market is reacting to higher bond yields and higher oil prices," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, said of the mostly down session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.8 percent at 42,931.60.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,853.98, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 18,540.01.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts described a relatively light day in terms of economic news, with the main story that China's central bank had cut two key interest rates in a move to stimulate the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ablin said many investors are "sitting tight" with the US presidential election now in its home stretch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It just seems like an awkward time to be making big bets," he said. "We'll know a lot more in two weeks we hope."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Boeing rose 3.1 percent after labour negotiators agreed to present a new contract to 33,000 Seattle-area workers, potentially resolving the month-long machinist union strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Disney shed 0.6 percent after announcing that it plans to name a new CEO in early 2026. The company named former Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman as chairperson, replacing former Nike CEO Mark Parker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This week's earnings calendar includes reports from General Motors, Boeing, UPS and Tesla. (AFP)

  <img alt="China's central bank has cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.10 percent from 3.35 percent, and the five-year LPR has been cut to 3.6 percent from 3.85 percent.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 chalked up record closing highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq also in positive territory, as markets were boosted by an earnings-driven jump in Netflix shares and broader gains across technology stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major Wall Street benchmarks also comfortably secured a sixth straight weekly gain, their longest weekly winning streaks since late 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.09 percent s to close at 43,277. The S&P gained 0.4 percent to end at 5,864, while the Nasdaq rose 0.63 percent, to 18,488.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Netflix jumped 11.1 percent to a record closing high after the streaming giant topped Wall Street estimates for subscriber additions and said it expected continued growth through the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have driven much of Wall Street's rally this year, rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apple gained 1.2 percent after data showed a sharp increase in new iPhone sales in China, while chip heavyweight Nvidia advanced 0.8 percent after BofA Global Research hiked its price target on the stock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netflix's increase lifted the communication services sector 0.9 percent, making it the largest gainer among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, while information technology rose 0.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's kind of the 'what's not to like' market," said David Waddell, chief executive of Waddell & Associates, citing positive economic data, disinflation and upbeat earnings and forecasts from corporate America. (Reuters)

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday rolled out new capital rules and various support measures aimed at assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including HK$370 billion in dedicated funds offered by banks.

   <br/>
   The measures include allowing banks to apply more favourable capital requirements for larger enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new regulation, which is set to take effect in January next year, will cover businesses with annual turnover of up to HK$500 million – an increase from the previous cap of HK$100 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Countercyclical Capital Buffer has also been reduced from 1 percent to 0.5 percent with immediate effect, allowing banks to lend more freely and reducing their loan costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The authority added that 16 banks participating in the Taskforce on SME Lending have set aside a total of over HK$370 billion in dedicated funds for SMEs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “About that HK$370 billion dedicated funds for SMEs, that is actually more about a commitment by those banks involved in making sure that the supply of the credit will be there, but of course subject to prudent risk management,” said HKMA executive director Carmen Chu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A deputy chief executive at the authority, Arthur Yuen, said the dedicated funds are not a static figure and can be adjusted based on market conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will continue to discuss with the banks through the taskforce whether there's any room for further enhancing or increasing that number,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen said the taskforce, established in August, has received over 100 enquiries so far, with almost half requiring no intervention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But the taskforce did look into the remaining 60 percent of the cases and in some of the cases it involves communications between banks and customers. Some involve the processing time. Some involve the request for documents”, Yuen said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some also relate to how banks actually interact with customers when they are processing the application, whether they can smoothen some of the requests for information, et cetera. So the taskforce has been involved in sorting out some of those procedural sort of enhancements,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen also said the relaunch of the principal moratorium scheme, announced in this year’s Policy Address, will provide “important breathing space” for SMEs to transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SMEs are entitled to the moratorium if they borrow money through the government-backed SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We talked about digital transformation and green transformation, but for SMEs to go through digital transformation and green transformation, they need time, they need continuous support from the banking industry. So having the SFGS principal moratorium re-introduced is an important breathing space for that sort of transformation process to start,” Yuen said.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's economy grew by 4.6 percent in the third quarter, down 0.1 percentage point from the previous three-month period, while consumption and factory output figures beat forecasts last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a post-data press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, underpinned by further policy support and another cut to the amount banks must hold in reserve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Based on our comprehensive assessment, the economy in the fourth quarter is expected to continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September. We are fully confident in achieving the full-year target," Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The NBS also said in a statement that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first three quarters, China's factory output rose 5.8 percent, while retail sales expanded 3.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, property investment sank 10.1 percent and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the release of the new data, state media said China’s top banks had cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year as part of a move to boost lending.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland policymakers have in recent weeks unveiled a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank on Friday launched one such measure – a swap facility for funds and insurers with an "initial application quota exceeding 200 billion yuan", state media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will provide greater liquidity for capital markets, which policymakers hope will offer support for the wider economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a possible sign of more relief to come, PBoC chief Pan Gongsheng said on Friday that officials were considering a further cut to the amount commercial lenders must hold in reserve before the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, China's finance minister pledged to "significantly increase" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package. (Agencies)

    Chinese banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775090_2_20241018133403.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's top banks on Friday cut interest rates on deposits in yuan for the second time this year, state media said, as Beijing seeks to boost sluggish consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed in mixed territory on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite once more buoyed by renewed interest in chipmakers and designers like Nvidia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent to end at a new record of 43,239.05, while the S&P 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to close at 5,841.47.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose less than 0.1 percent to close at 18,373.61, as chip design titan Nvidia saw its share price rise 0.9 percent on the back of a 9.8 percent rise in chipmaker TSMC's shares on strong third quarter results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders were also digesting fresh data published on Thursday showing an acceleration in retail sales last month, and another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mill Street Research chief strategist Sam Burns told AFP that the positive economic news in the US, and rate cut in Europe, had helped stocks to return to near all-time highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Earnings reports so far have been pretty good and there doesn't seem to be too much concern, at least so far, about the election and things like that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among other firms, streaming giant Netflix's shares rose in after-hours trading after it announced it had topped earnings expectations in the third quarter. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales in the United States accelerated in September, according to government data released on Thursday, even as auto and gas station sales remained tepid for the month -- a positive sign as the election approaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Overall sales rose 0.4 percent to US$714.4 billion between August and September, according to Commerce Department data, beating analysts' expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, sales edged up just 0.1 percent to US$711.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Excluding auto and gas station sales, the overall monthly rise would have been even higher at 0.7 percent in September, the report added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the US central bank had kept interest rates high for a large part of the year -- raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to tamp down inflation -- consumer spending has been more robust than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Households have been drawing down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period, and the economy could be given a further boost with the Federal Reserve starting to lower rates more recently.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Compared with the same month a year ago, retail sales were up 1.7 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon Macroeconomics noted in a recent report that "with growth in labour income slowing, credit conditions remaining tight and households recently having exhausted their excess savings, we expect growth to slow sharply over the next couple of quarters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon analysts added that "Hurricane Helene probably landed too late in the month" to have an impact on the sales figures, "and was too localized to have a major impact on national sales." (AFP)

  <img alt="Chip giant TSMC announced Thursday a bigger-than-expected increase in net profit for the third quarter of 2024.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   TSMC, the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reported on Thursday a forecast-beating 54 percent jump in third-quarter profit on the back of soaring demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI across a spectrum of industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC posted a net profit of T$325.3 billion (US$10.11 billion) for the quarter which ended September 30, compared with the T$300.2 billion predicted by analysts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said third-quarter revenue rose 36 percent year-on-year to US$23.5 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of up to US$23.2 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories in other parts of the world, including US$65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On its last earnings call in July, TSMC raised its full-year revenue forecast and adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between US$30 billion and US$32 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI boom has helped drive up TSMC shares, with its Taipei-listed stock leaping 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 28 percent gain for the broader market, giving it a market capitalisation of around US$840 billion. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks bounced back on Wednesday after retreating a day prior, while earnings season was off to a relatively positive start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones gained 0.8 percent to 43,077, while the S&P 500 Index added 0.5 percent to 5,842.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq advanced 0.3 percent, closing at 18,367.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks picked up towards the end of the day as investors sought to "buy the dip," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, the nuclear stocks are going crazy on the Amazon announcement," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech giant Amazon announced significant investments in nuclear energy on Wednesday, joining other major companies in aiming to meet the high electric power demands of artificial intelligence using atomic energy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its shares closed 0.4 percent lower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among companies that reported financial results this week, Morgan Stanley beat estimates with its third quarter report on Wednesday – after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs showed a jump in profits a day earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick said the bank saw a "strong third quarter in a constructive environment," and its shares closed 6.5 percent up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is "not a lot of conviction after yesterday's chipmaker-led declines," noted Briefing.com on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML saw its shares plunge after it unveiled a cut to its 2025 guidance and slump in sales bookings, sending share prices of other firms falling on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Nvidia recovered some ground on Wednesday, with its shares up 3.1 percent, ASML and AMD both logged declines still. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former US president Donald Trump's cryptocurrency platform had a faltering sales launch on Tuesday, with only a fraction of its digital tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican candidate announced in mid-September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch the platform named World Liberty Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 billion digital tokens, priced at 1.5 cents each, were offered by the company – a total value of US$300 million – but just three percent had been purchased by Tuesday evening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tokens can be used as cryptocurrencies and give buyers a vote on the platform's governance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many observers blamed the low sales on technical problems, as the company's website suffered outages earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World Liberty Financial will enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies to or from one another, a service already offered by many platforms, one of the best-known of which is Aave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, presenting himself as a "pro-bitcoin president" if elected in November. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors assessed a series of earnings reports, and with chipmaker equities weakening on news the United States may introduce export curbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones slumped 0.8 percent to 42,740, as did the S&P 500 to 5,815.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq retreated 1.0 percent to 18,315.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks saw a mixed performance at the start of the day, with traders responding mostly positively to earnings reports, but eventually they lost ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chipmakers in particular struggled as markets reacted to reports that President Joe Biden's administration was considering a cap on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML, which supplies chip-making machines to the semiconductor industry, also saw its shares dive in Europe after unveiling a cut to its 2025 guidance and seeing a disappointing slump in sales bookings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The selloff is because of ASML suggesting that demand is not as strong" as anticipated for chips and AI, said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "ASML mentioned that demand is down from China. That's one of the biggest markets. There's chatter that the US government could start perhaps curbing chip sales even more," Krosby added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, ASML shares plunged 16.3 percent in the United States, while chip titan Nvidia lost 4.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   AMD, another major chip company, was down 5.2 percent. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia took aim at firms charging consumers for tap or bankcard payments on Tuesday, targeting "hefty" fees in a billion-dollar industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's centre-left government said it would "ban debit card surcharges" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves," said economy minister Jim Chalmers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street finished higher on Monday ahead of a slew of high-profile corporate earnings, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to fresh records.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 5,859.85, while the Dow ended the day up 0.5 at 43,065.22 -- the first time it has closed above 43,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 percent to finish the day at 18,502.69, spurred by a 2.4 percent increase in the share price of chipmaker Nvidia, which closed at a new high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The market "just continues to sort of squeeze higher, led by primarily the mega cap stocks," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You have a market that clearly is continuing to show no signs of breaking here," he added. "And that, I think, is kind of keeping people fearful about missing out on further gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elsewhere on Wall Street, McDonald's and UnitedHealth Group finished up 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders are eying a busy week of earnings results ahead from US companies including Netflix, Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's exports grew at the slowest pace in five months in September, suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from several trade partners and that global demand for Chinese goods is softening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was "fully confident" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of the accounting regulatory body has been appointed chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kelvin Wong will take up the SFC post from October 24 on a three-year term and will step down as head of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC) on December 31.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong was a non-executive director of the SFC from 2012 to 2018 and a member of the listing committee of Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited from 2007 to 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Wong has been dedicated to serving the financial services industry, with extensive experience in the operation of the securities and futures markets, capital market development, corporate governance and financial regulatory matters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect that under Dr Wong's leadership, the SFC will continue to uphold its dual role as a regulator and facilitator of market development to ensure the fair, transparent and orderly operation of the local securities and futures markets, and to strive for reforms and innovations, with a view to solidifying and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre," Chan said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Incumbent SFC chairman Tim Lui will complete his six-year term on October 19.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's consumer inflation rate slowed in September, official data showed on Sunday, while producer price deflation deepened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in September, down from the 0.6 percent increase recorded in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) fell at the fastest pace in six months, down 2.8 percent year-on-year in September, versus a 1.8 percent decline the previous month
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The slowdown comes as authorities have been seeking to boost domestic activity and shore up China's property sector, with officials on Saturday announcing plans for a significant fiscal stimulus package.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a news conference there will be more "counter-cyclical measures" this year, but officials did not provide details on the size or timing of fiscal stimulus being prepared, which investors hope will ease deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China faces persistent deflationary pressure due to weak domestic demand. The change of fiscal policy stance as indicated by the press conference yesterday (Saturday) would help to deal with such problems," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland authorities have stepped up stimulus efforts in recent weeks to spur demand and help meet an around 5 percent economic growth target for this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent weeks, policymakers have unveiled a string of measures in a bid to stimulate activity and spur household consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the Covid-19 pandemic, including numerous steps to help pull the property sector out of a severe, multi-year slump, including mortgage rate cuts. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Commerce Ministry said on Saturday that talks in Brussels over the European Union's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles have ended with "major differences" remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Friday, Brussels voted to impose additional new tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric cars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Representatives from Beijing and the 27-member bloc have held eight rounds of talks over the issue in Brussels since September 20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still major differences between the two sides," a ministry statement said, adding that it has invited EU negotiators for further discussions in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Negotiators "made important progress in some areas," the statement said, but "have not reached a solution acceptable to both sides".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is hoped that the EU can meet China halfway, arrange to come to China as soon as possible, and accelerate the consultations with a constructive attitude, so as to reach a proper solution as soon as possible," the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier this month, China slapped provisional tariffs on EU-made brandy, alarming French producers. (Xinhua/AFP)

   The annual return rate of the pension funds entrusted for investment by local governments in China has reached 5 percent since the end of 2016, according to a report released on Saturday by the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The local pension fund is part of the basic pension fund. The central government started market operation of the basic pension fund in December 2016, with the aim of preserving and increasing its value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, the local pension funds managed by the NCSSF have earned an investment income of 306.67 billion yuan, achieving an average annual investment return rate of 5 percent, according to the report.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2023, investment income of the local pension funds amounted to 39.58 billion yuan, with an investment return rate of 2.42 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report went on to say that the total assets of the basic pension funds had reached over 2.23 trillion yuan by the end of 2023. (CCTV)

    Boeing to cut 10% of workforce as it sees big Q3 loss

Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774207_1_20241012160519.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing announced that it plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce as it projected a large third-quarter loss amid a machinist strike in the Seattle region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aviation giant must "reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality," Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said on Friday, adding that the cuts of 17,000 positions globally "will include executives, managers and employees."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company announced a series of belt-tightening measures and production delays as the nearly monthlong strike of 33,000 workers has added to the company's litany of problems.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing staff with the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and Aerospace Workers walked off the job on September 13 after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing, which has also faced significant scrutiny over commercial aviation safety lapses and stumbles in its Starliner space program, said the IAM strike contributed to US$3 billion in pre-tax charges to its commercial aviation results in the third quarter, part of an anticipated loss of US$9.97 per share.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "While our business is facing near-term challenges, we are making important strategic decisions for our future and have a clear view on the work we must do to restore our company," Ortberg said in a press release.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These decisive actions, along with key structural changes to our business, are necessary to remain competitive over the long term."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Details of the cuts would come next week, he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As a result of the strike, Boeing said it is pushing back first delivery of the 777X to 2026 from 2025. The much-delayed jet was originally supposed to enter service in January 2020.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company plans to cease production of the 767 Freighter in 2027 once it completes production on current orders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The striking workers are seeking hefty wage hikes and a reinstatement of their pension, complaining of more than a decade of near-flat wages amid inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ratings agency S&P estimated this week that the strike was costing Boeing US$1 billion per month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Boeing fell about 1 percent in after-hours trading. (AFP)

   The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent to 5,815.03, also a record, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.3 percent to 18,342.94.

   <br/>
   Dow member JPMorgan Chase rose more than four percent as it reported better than expected earnings behind higher revenues for equity trading and increased fees for asset management and investment banking.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors also cheered the bank's assessment that the US economy remains "resilient" and poised to avoid a recession.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The bank earnings were an excuse to rally, not necessarily a reason to rally," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers. "Right now the market mentality is to rally, and it's going to do that... unless it has a reason not to, and there was no reason not to today."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Markets digested data showing US wholesale prices were flat in September and a dip in US consumer confidence in October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have said the latest inflation data likely reduces the odds of another large interest cut by the Federal Reserve in November, but doesn't eliminate the chance for a smaller reduction.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Expectations for Fed relief on interest rates has propelled the market for much of 2024.

    Wall Street slumps after inflation cools

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street's main indices closed lower on Thursday as investors looked to higher-than-expected inflation and unemployment claims for indications on the health of the US economy and the path for interest rates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent on a monthly basis in September and 2.4% on an annual basis, with both figures being slightly higher than estimated by economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The core figure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.3 percent year-over-year, versus an estimate of 3.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a separate report released on Thursday, jobless claims also rose to 258,000 for the week ending Oct. 5, versus an estimate of 230,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Investors were torn between a stronger than expected CPI report and a weaker than expected unemployment claims report," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital in Chicago. "One showed inflation running hotter than expected and the other showed the economy looking weaker than expected. It's the worst of both worlds."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After the economic data, traders were pricing in a roughly 80 percent probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at its meeting in November and a roughly 20 percent chance it would leave rates unchanged, according to CME's FedWatch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Thursday said he would be "totally comfortable" skipping an interest-rate cut at an upcoming meeting of the US central bank, adding that the "choppiness" in recent data on inflation and employment may warrant leaving rates on hold in November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said he sees "gradual" rate cuts over the next year-and-a-half, while the New York Fed's John Williams said he still sees rate reductions ahead.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to preliminary data, the Dow Jones fell 0.13 percent to 42,456, the S&P fell 0.20 percent, closing at 5,780 and the Nasdaq fell 0.05 percent to finish at 18,281.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both the S&P 500 and the Dow had notched record closing highs in the previous day's session. (Reuters)

  <img alt="A measure of inflation, closely watched by the Fed and the markets and which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose slightly to 3.3 percent.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   US consumer inflation cooled slightly less than expected last month, according to government data published on Thursday, providing further evidence that price pressures are easing ahead of November's presidential election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.4 percent in September from a year ago, down from 2.5 percent in August, the Labor Department said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was slightly below the median forecast of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There was also some cause for concern for the Federal Reserve as it looks to cut interest rates: A measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy costs rose slightly to 3.3 percent, up from 3.2 percent in August, buoyed by a jump in the transportation services index last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Monthly headline inflation rose by 0.2 percent, while core inflation also exceeded forecasts to increase by 0.3 percent. Both monthly figures also exceeded expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite the "slight upward surprise relative to what we're expecting," the inflation picture isn't all bad, Oxford Economics' deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce told AFP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think the broader trend in services inflation, I think I'm still confident in the view that that's going to continue to trend lower over the next 12 months," he said, referring to easing of services inflation from 0.2 percent in August to 0.2 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economy has remained a top concern for voters going into the upcoming presidential election, in which Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is running against the Republican former president Donald Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both candidates have looked to talk up their record in government while criticizing their opponent's economic plans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While inflation has eased toward the Federal Reserve's long-term target of two percent, the labour market has shown some signs of cooling in recent months, causing policymakers to refocus their attention on the employment side of the bank's dual mandate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Against this backdrop, the Fed voted last month to cut interest rates by half a percentage-point and pencilled in an additional half point of cuts this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Thursday's inflation data "supports a more measured pace of rate cuts," Pearce from Oxford Economics said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think they're still confident that inflation is heading down, but obviously that, you know, we will see noisy reports like today's," he added. "It's going to be a bumpy process. It's not a glide path down to down to two percent." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China will resume imports of Australian lobster by year-end, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday, marking the end of a four-year diplomatic fight that saw tens of billions of dollars of Australian exports locked out of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese said he agreed on the timeline to resume full lobster trade by year end during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Laos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This, of course, will be in time for Chinese New Year and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry in places like Geraldton, and South Australia and Tasmania, and so many parts of particularly regional Australia," Albanese said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China first imposed unofficial bans and tariffs on Australian goods ranging from coal to wine and rock lobster in late 2020 after years of tensions that culminated in Canberra calling for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Thursday's announcement, all the restrictions on bar lobster had been removed as relations between the major trading partners improved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li said the progress reached on the issue showed that China-Australia relations were promising, as long as the two sides continued to work towards a common goal. (Reuters/Xinhua)

   Asian markets tracked a record day on Wall Street Thursday, with Shanghai and Hong Kong supported by the People's Bank of China's move to boost liquidity for major stock-buyers.

   <br/>
   Companies will be allowed to use equities, bonds and other assets as collateral for "high-grade liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills", it said.

    Indian tycoon Ratan Tata dies aged 86

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Ratan Tata, a former chairman of Indian conglomerate Tata Sons hailed as a visionary business leader, died at a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday night. He was 86.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran confirmed Tata’s death and described him in a statement as his “friend, mentor, and guide.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He did not provide a cause of death.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata was admitted this week to the Breach Candy Hospital in south Mumbai, the city where he lived.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soon after he was hospitalised, Tata issued a statement on Monday saying there was no cause for concern regarding his health and he was undergoing checkups for age-related medical conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described Tata as a visionary leader, and a compassionate and extraordinary human being.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond boardrooms," Modi said on X.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tata endeared himself to people, thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,” Modi said, referring to his philanthropy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Ratan Tata left behind an extraordinary business and philanthropic legacy and he was instrumental in mentoring and developing modern business leadership in India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "My last meeting with Ratan Tata at Google, we talked about the progress of Waymo and his vision was inspiring to hear,” Pichai said on X. "He deeply cared about making India better.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, said, “It is a very sad day for India and India Inc," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Ratan Tata’s passing away is a big loss, not just to the Tata Group, but to every Indian.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata received the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s most distinguished civilian awards, in 2000 and "Padma Vibhushan" in 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Group is a sprawling collection of nearly 100 companies, including the country’s largest automaker, the largest private steel company and a leading outsourcing firm.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The companies employ more than 350,000 people worldwide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In June 2008, Tata bought Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford for US$2.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched an airline in 1932 that later became Air India. The government later took it over.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata Group bought state-owned Air India in 2021. It also started a full-service carrier, Vistara, with Singapore Airlines, but recently merged it with Air India.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tata companies include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Power and the information technology company Tata Consultancy Services. (AP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's central bank said on Thursday it would start accepting applications from financial institutions to join a newly created funding scheme, initially worth 500 billion yuan, to aid the capital market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can apply to join the swap scheme, which gives them easier access to funding to buy stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC first announced the scheme on September 24 as part of a broad package of policies to stimulate the economy and boost capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the swap facility, eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can use their assets including bonds, stock ETFs and holdings in constituents of the CSI 300 Index as collateral in exchange for highly liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The initial scale of the swap program is set at 500 billion yuan, and can be expanded in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement came after mainland stocks tumbled on Wednesday following a blistering rally in response to one of Beijing’s most aggressive stimulus package in years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC had slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major cities – including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen – have also further eased restrictions on buying homes, and top officials including Premier Li Qiang have called for more effective implementation of the slate of measures.(Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Both the Dow and S&P 500 rocketed to fresh records on Wednesday behind gains in technology shares as markets monitored a major US hurricane and digested Federal Reserve minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Major tech names such as Apple and Amazon won more than one percent in a move analysts characterised as a "buy-the-dip" bounce after weakness in recent sessions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fed minutes showed a divided group of policy makers, belying a one-sided vote last month for a large interest rate cut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones jumped 1.0 percent to 42,512, topping a record from late September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 climbed 0.7 percent to 5,792, also a record, while the Nasdaq advanced 0.6 percent to 18,291.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Florida residents fled – or defied warnings and tried to take shelter – on Wednesday in the final hours before Hurricane Milton, a lethal Category 4 storm, roars out of the ocean and tears across the state.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial markets were looking ahead to Thursday's consumer price index report, expected to influence future Fed actions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   An exception among tech stocks was Alphabet, which fell 1.6 percent after the Department of Justice said on Tuesday it would demand that Google make profound changes to how it does business and even consider the possibility of a breakup, after the tech juggernaut was found to be running an illegal monopoly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing sank 3.4 percent as the aerospace giant suspended negotiations with its striking workers in the Pacific Northwest after two days of talks with the machinist union yielded no breakthrough.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S&P put Boeing on credit watch negative on Tuesday, pointing to "strike-related financial risk."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The action "reflects the increased likelihood of a downgrade if the strike persists toward the end of the year, further constraining the recovery in the company's cash flow generation and the company does not raise capital sufficient to meet its upcoming needs in such a way that does not increase financial leverage," S&P said.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Sales of US automaker Tesla's China-made electric vehicles rose 19.2 percent in September from a year earlier, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Wednesday. Deliveries of China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles were up 1.9 percent from the previous month. The company has already announced quarterly global deliveries but had not detailed sales in China. Chinese rival BYD, with its Dynasty and Ocean lineups of EVs and plug-in hybrids, recorded its best month with a 45.56 percent year-on-year increase in passenger vehicle sales to 417,603 units in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33,012 BYD cars, or 7.9 percent of the total sales, were sold overseas, BYD's filing showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With the September gain, Tesla saw 12 percent growth in China-made EV sales in the July-September period, its first quarterly rise this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US EV giant has been extending incentives to encourage consumers in the world's largest auto market where rivals including Xpeng and Nio were racing to launch new budget models.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It extended zero-interest financing in late September for some Model 3 and Model Y cars in China by another month to the end of October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla also plans to produce a six-seat variant of its best-selling, yet aging, Model Y in China from late 2025, Reuters reported.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EV maker, due to unveil its robotaxi on Oct. 10, said it was on course to launch Full Self-Driving (FSD) advanced driver assistance software in China and Europe next year, pending approval from regulators. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Stocks in Hong Kong and the mainland tumbled on another volatile day on Wednesday after Beijing disappointed investors over a lack of fresh stimulus and scant detail on its plans for implementing a raft of measures already unveiled.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After blockbuster performances in the wake of last month's announcements to kickstart growth, traders were left deflated after a news conference on Tuesday fell short of expectations and revived worries about the outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After swinging in the morning, the Hang Seng Index closed down 1.4 percent at 20,637.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turnover reached HK$427 billion, down from a record HK$620 billion on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index closed down 6.6 percent at 3,258 and the Shenzhen Component Index finished 8.15 percent lower at 10,557.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The combined turnover of the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses reached 2.94 trillion yuan, down from 3.45 trillion yuan the day before. (Agencies)

    Boeing suspends negotiations with striking workers

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Boeing on Tuesday suspended talks with its striking workers as it accused the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) of making unreasonable demands and withdrew its offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The union made non-negotiable demands far in excess of what can be accepted if we are to remain competitive as a business," the US aerospace giant said in an email to employees late Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Given that position, further negotiations do not make sense at this point and our offer has been withdrawn."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   About 33,000 Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest have been on strike for nearly a month in a fight focused on higher wages and improved retirement benefits.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Workers complain of more than a decade of near-flat wages during a period when inflation has risen.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing's most recent offer included a 30 percent wage hike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Negotiations, which included the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, resumed on Monday and continued into Tuesday, but no agreement was reached.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Our team bargained in good faith and made new and improved proposals to try to reach a compromise, including increases in take-home pay and retirement," Boeing said in the email, adding that "the union did not seriously consider our proposals."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We remain committed to finding a resolution and will work with the union when they are ready to bargain an agreement that recognises our employees and preserves our company's future," the email read.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the company announced earlier on Tuesday that it had delivered 33 new aircraft to customers in September in spite of the strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The aerospace giant delivered 27 Boeing 737 MAX jets assembled in Renton, Washington, which has gone quiet since the strike launched on September 13.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 737 MAX planes were cleared for delivery by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to Boeing, which expects fewer deliveries in the coming period due to the strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Airlines receiving new MAX planes included United Airlines, Ryanair, Southwest Airlines, Air India, China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing also delivered four 787 Dreamliner planes, which are assembled at a non-union plant in Charleston, South Carolina that is not out on strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Boeing has delivered 291 aircraft through the end of the third quarter, down 22 percent from the same period in 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Prior to the IAM strike, which has also shuttered an Everett plant where the 777 is assembled, the FAA had limited Boeing's production following a January incident on Alaska Airlines in which a panel blew out mid-flight, necessitating an emergency landing. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said Hong Kong should position itself as Asia's leading green financing hub due to it making significant strides in green and sustainable finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Citing the size of green bonds and debts, and the number of green funds setting up in Hong Kong over the past three years, Chan expressed optimism about the city's potential to emerge as a leading hub in Asia for transition finance -- which seeks to support high-emission sectors in their journey towards sustainability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong already has a very strong foundation to develop the transition finance market – including a robust regulatory framework, the necessary financial infrastructure, a well-developed market, and expertise on standard-setting and compliance. What we need now is to raise the awareness of the necessity of transition finance and the potential it offers," Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also addressed the importance of developing a taxonomy for sustainable finance. He said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is working on a taxonomy that will incorporate transition activities, with plans for public consultation in early 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan emphasised the need for improved sustainability disclosures at the company level to enable investors to evaluate corporate commitments to environmental standards. He said Hong Kong aims to align its local sustainability disclosure requirements with those set by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Shanghai stocks tumbled more than four percent at the open on Wednesday after racking up big gains a day earlier following a week-long break, but Hong Kong clawed back some of the losses of more than nine percent it suffered.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index shed 4.54 percent, or 158 points, to 3,331, and the Shenzhen Composite Index dropped 4.31 percent, or 90 points, to 2,008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both bourses saw big gains the day before but were well off their initial highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hang Seng Index gained 1.74 percent, or 363 points, to 21,290, having tanked more than nine percent on Tuesday, its biggest loss since the 2008 global financial crisis.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities in the mainland and Hong Kong rocketed after China last month began announcing measures aimed at boosting the world's number two economy, piling on more than 20 percent each.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, a much-anticipated news conference in Beijing on Tuesday – after the Golden Week break – left traders disappointed as officials refused to unveil more stimulus and provided scant detail on the measures already pledged. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street advanced on Tuesday as tech shares gained and oil prices fell, while investors assessed unrest in the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.3 percent to 42,080, while the S&P 500 added 1.0 percent to 5,751.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq jumped 1.5 percent to 18,182.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Technology is up, and that's helping the sentiment of the market," said Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Nvidia shares were up 4.1 percent while Facebook parent Meta Platforms increased 1.4 percent and Microsoft rose 1.3 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cardillo added that a pullback in oil prices was another positive for the market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Oil prices were moving up on anticipation of a retaliation move by Iran. And so far, that hasn't happened," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brent, the international benchmark, and US contract West Texas Intermediate both slipped by 4.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This likely reflected a shift in focus, back on demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an interview published on Tuesday, New York Federal Reserve president John Williams also told the Financial Times that the central bank's bold interest rate cut in September is not necessarily an indication of how it will act in the coming months. (AFP)

    China to impose anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China has imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on brandy imports from the European Union (EU), hitting brands from Hennessy to Remy Martin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday that an investigation has preliminarily determined that dumping of brandy, or the act of exporting goods to a foreign market at a low price, from the EU is threatening the nation's own brandy sector with "substantial damage".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that as of October 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits, mostly ranging from 34.8 percent to 39 percent of the import value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France, which supported tariffs on mainland-made electric vehicles (EVs), accounted for 99 percent of China's brandy imports last year, with brandy shipments from the country reaching US$1.7 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands worst-hit, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39 and 38.1 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures came on the heels of the EU's move to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In that decision, the bloc set tariff rates ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with the EU's anti-subsidy investigation. These will come on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing called the tariffs protectionist and a violation of World Trade Organisation regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission has said it's willing to continue negotiating an alternative, even after tariffs are imposed. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong stocks nosedived on Tuesday, losing more than 9 percent, while mainland markets reopened after a weeklong holiday with solid gains as Beijing expressed confidence that it will meet its economic targets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hang Seng Index had shed more than 5.5 percent, or nearly 1,300 points, in morning trade, and the sell-off continued in the afternoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The index finished the day 9.4 percent or 2,172 points lower at 20,926, the biggest drop in 16 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Turnover topped HK$620 billion, a fresh record high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Losses were recorded across the board.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It was a different story on the mainland, with the Shanghai Composite Index up 4.59 percent to 3,489 and the Shenzhen Component Index putting on 9.17 percent at 11,495.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares had hit two-year peaks in early trade before giving up some of those gains.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a press briefing in Beijing, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission, Zheng Shanjie, said China is fully confident of achieving economic targets for 2024 and would pull forward 200 billion yuan from next year's budget to spend on investment projects and support local governments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But some investors were left disappointed by what they see as a lack of new stimulus. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chief Executive John Lee has vowed to work with authorities across the border to enhance measures facilitating mutual access between financial markets on the mainland and in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At a forum on Tuesday, Lee hailed the Greater Bay Area as "an important testing ground and participant" for mutual market access.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the administration would continue to make good use of Hong Kong's leading advantages as a financial centre, while calling on political and business leaders to capitalise on the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The SAR government will continue to work closely with relevant mainland departments and trades to continuously optimise various mutual access measures, promote the integration of financial markets in the Greater Bay Area, work for the country's development strategy on being a financial powerhouse, and achieve high-quality development," Lee said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All political and business leaders should also make good use of the countless opportunities in the Greater Bay Area to work together for a win-win situation."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sun Yu, vice-chairman and chief executive of Bank of China (Hong Kong), urged the city to "take the initiative" to attract more businesses from all over the world to invest and operate in Hong Kong and other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He added the SAR should strive to further develop into an investment and financial centre for emerging markets, to bring in companies with development potential from Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
