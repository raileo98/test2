 Wall Street stocks rose on Tuesday, bouncing back from the prior session's declines in a benign session held as voters went to the polls in the US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  Forecasters have for weeks pointed to a neck-and-neck contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What the market is saying is that the economy has continued to hold up even in the face of all this uncertainty that we have," said Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, who pointed to a host of potentially market-moving policy areas affected by the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones finished up 1.0 percent at 42,221.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.2 percent to 5,782, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.4 percent to 18,439.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 pushed higher, led by consumer discretionary and industrial stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Large technology equities also advanced, including Netflix, which won 1.1 percent despite a raid of the company's offices in Paris and Amsterdam on Tuesday as part of a tax fraud probe, according to a judicial source.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing dropped 2.6 percent as a machinist union voted to accept the company's latest contract offer, ending a more than seven week strike that closed two assembly plants in the Seattle area. The new contract includes a 38 percent wage hike. (AFP)

 Local stocks on Tuesday overcame early losses to finish more than 2 percent higher, thanks partly to fresh confidence towards the Chinese economy.
 <br>

  The Hang Seng Index gained 439 points to 21,006, its highest finish in three weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most blue chips and tech plays closed higher.

  <br>
  Mainland stocks also did well, finishing at four-week highs, after Premier Li Qiang expressed confidence in the country's economic recovery.

 US stocks closed slightly lower after a choppy session on Monday, as investors prepared for a crucial week in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve will release a policy statement.
 <br>
  <br>
  Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both scrambled for an edge in the last full day of a race that polls show as extremely close. It could take days to determine the victor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Some of the so-called "Trump trades" unwound after a recent poll showed Harris, the Democratic vice president, leading in Iowa, sparking a drop in the US dollar, Treasury yields and bitcoin. Trump Media &amp; Technology Group closed up 12.4 percent, bouncing back from early losses of nearly 6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6 percent, to 41,794, the S&amp;P 500 lost 16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,712 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 59 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,179.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors were largely pricing in a Fed interest rate cut of 25 basis points at its policy announcement on Thursday, with CME's FedWatch Tool showing markets pricing in a 98 percent chance of a cut, with only a 2 percent chance the central bank keeps rates steady.
  <br>
  <br>
  The biggest gainer among the 11 major S&amp;P sectors was energy, up 1.9 percent as oil prices climbed after OPEC+ decided to delay plans for an output increase. (Reuters)

    Exchange Fund sees record income for first nine months
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777488-20241104.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Exchange Fund recorded a record-breaking investment income of HK$224.7 billion for the first nine months of the year, the Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The fund posted gains of HK$114.6 billion in the third quarter alone, with the largest gain coming from bond investments, which contributed HK$66 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investments in Hong Kong stocks posted gains for the second consecutive quarter, adding about HK$22 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gains from other stocks totalled HK$18 billion while the valuation of foreign exchange brought in HK$8 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The figure for the first three quarters saw the investment income falling just HK$40 billion short of the total annual record of HK$264 billion in 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters, the HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said it is difficult to tell if this year’s annual figure will set a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We’ve got two more months to go, and the financial market, even a week or month, is a very long period. During those two months, even within this week, we are seeing different developments that will have an impact on the market,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “For example, the pace of the US interest rate reduction is still unknown. The market is expecting that at the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting this week, the Federal Reserve will continue with the reduction path, with a cut of let's say 25 basis points as expected by the market. But what the commentary will be, and how they will assess the forward path will have an impact on the market.”
  <br>
  <br>
  Yue also noted factors – such as whether China will announce more economic stimulus measures, as well as uncertainties arising from the geopolitical conditions – will influence the fund’s performance.

 Hong Kong stocks rose in early trade on Monday in a week that's expected to be dominated by the US presidential election and a Federal Reserve meeting.

    Nvidia to join key US stock index
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777296-20241102.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chip giant Nvidia will join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Wall Street index announced on Friday, underscoring the importance of artificial intelligence in the US economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The addition of Nvidia, which will take effect on November 8, also marks a historic moment for the semiconductor industry, as the AI chip leader replaces struggling rival Intel, which has been a Dow constituent since 1999.
  <br>
  <br>
  S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the company that runs the index, also said it would add paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams, replacing chemical giant Dow.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Nvidia have climbed over 180 percent this year as tech giants clamour for its powerful and high cost processors that power generative AI, the technology that is widely seen as the next phase of innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Intel, one of Silicon Valley's most iconic companies, has seen its shares fall 50 percent so far this year as the company struggles to meet the AI boom.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is often used as a bellwether for the state of the US stock market, the biggest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike the S&amp;P500 that weighs companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more influence on its movements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech companies Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce and Cisco Systems are currently in the index, while Google, Amazon and Meta are not. (AFP)

    US markets bounce back, lifted by Amazon
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777288-20241102.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rebounded on Friday from mixed tech earnings and investor jitters less than a week before a neck-and-neck US presidential election.
 <br>
  <br>
  After major indices tumbled on Thursday following big drops in Microsoft and Meta, buoyant results from Amazon helped boost the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors also took the bright side of a weak employment report that showed the US economy added just 12,000 jobs last month, far below expectations in a report that was temporarily distorted by major hurricanes and the Boeing strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  But on the positive side, the report bolstered the chance that the Fed will reduce interest rates again next week. Futures markets overwhelmingly expect a quarter-point cut.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices advanced, led by the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.7 percent at 42,052.19, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 5,728.80 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 percent to 18,239.92.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Amazon report "countered some of the negativity that was building yesterday on the mega-cap" stocks, said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts expect cautious trading early next week ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday, with the result possibly delayed for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices gained following reports that Iran was planning a major retaliatory strike on Israel, reviving the market's geopolitical fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Expectations of a major rate cut by the Fed, like the bumper 50 basis point cut in September, have receded after data showed strong economic growth in the United States and inflation just above the central bank's long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the "lower-than-expected jobs creation could prompt the Fed to follow through with the widely anticipated 25 basis point cut following their next meeting later next week," said Mahmoud Alkudsi, senior market analyst at ADSS brokerage.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst with eToro, said the October jobs numbers "should keep a December rate cut on the table, too." (AFP)

    Retail sales drop 6.9 percent in September
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777220-20241101.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales were down 6.9 percent in September compared to the same month last year, marking the seventh consecutive month of year-on-year declines.
 <br>
  <br>
  Official data released on Friday showed that the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The drop followed a revised 10 percent fall in August and an 11.7 percent decrease in July.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sales of motor vehicles and parts saw the most dramatic fall, with a 26.7 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said a change in consumer patterns will continue to affect the retail sector in the near future.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Nevertheless, an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures, and a possible easing of the Hong Kong dollar alongside the US dollar with the commencement of the US interest rate cut, would be conducive to boosting sentiment and supporting spending," a government spokesman said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the executive director of the Retail Management Association, Bond Law, said the sector is pessimistic about sales for the rest of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's anticipated that many local people will travel abroad during the Christmas period, and certain domestic-related retail categories are expected to see a decline in business," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Due to the absence of Christmas holidays on the mainland, the tourist-related retail categories, such as watches and jewellery, are also expected to perform worse than last year."

    Hong Kong to relaunch Islamic finance drive: Paul Chan
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777149-20241101.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan says Hong Kong is ready to relaunch its drive to develop Islamic finance, after a three-day trip to the Saudi capital Riyadh opened his eyes to the untapped potential of developing more financial products that comply with Islamic law.
 <br>
  <br>
  During the visit, the Hong Kong delegation led by the finance chief signed 10 memoranda of understanding to further cooperation between the two sides.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreements covered areas from mutual investment to collaborations in technology and innovation development, while a local tech firm signed on to launch insurance products with two Saudi companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday to conclude his visit, Chan said his exchanges made it apparent that Saudi Arabia is more interested in the Hong Kong, mainland and Asian markets than he had previously thought.
  <br>
  <br>
  He told reporters that he came to understand that the kingdom wants to attract different sources of funding to support its infrastructure and industrial development, and hence there’s a demand for diverse forms of financing.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Previously, we thought that market demand for Islamic finance wasn't that high. But after talking to them, we think we'll relaunch Islamic finance soon," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They have to do a lot of infrastructure work. During our exchanges with them, we discussed Islamic finance, as well as using funds raised from issuing green and sustainable bonds in the Hong Kong bond market to support them."
  <br>
  <br>
  Islamic finance involves business transactions that are in full compliance with Islamic law – and which prohibits any involvement with, for example, gambling, alcohol and pork, while interest payments are also banned.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance minister also revealed that the Future Investment Initiative, or FII Institute, is eager to stage the FII Priority Summit in Hong Kong again.
  <br>
  <br>
  He pointed out that Saudi Arabia is very interested in research and development of technologies, and welcomes SAR companies to set up shop in the kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>
  Saudi Arabia found that it is worth taking reference to Hong Kong's way of nurturing start-ups and talent, according to Chan.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They think that our way of nurturing talent through two parks and offering funds to support them, or even the tailor-made listing regime that allows start-ups without profits and income to be listed, is very worth taking reference to."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for nurturing talent, their insurance authority recently went to Hong Kong for an exchange with the local authority. They want to send someone to Hong Kong on secondment, so as to introduce some of our practice to the country. I think this is a good thing."
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said there was no need to adjust Hong Kong’s full-year economic growth forecast, even though the city’s third quarter growth has slowed to 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "During the announcement of the Financial Budget at the beginning of this year, we expected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent. I think that the growth could still be within this range. Therefore there's no need to adjust it," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that the government will remain both cautious and optimistic.

    Boeing sweetens offer for striking workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 US aviation giant Boeing has improved the conditions in its contract offer to thousands of striking workers, with a 38 percent wage increase over four years and a ratification bonus, their union said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, which represents more than 33,000 workers who went on strike on September 13 in the Seattle area, has endorsed the contract, and scheduled a vote on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Your union is endorsing and recommending the latest IAM/Boeing contract proposal. It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory," the IAM chapter said.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was the fourth offer made by Boeing since early September, but the third on which members have been asked to vote.
  <br>
  <br>
  Members overwhelmingly rejected an offer of a 25 percent raise over four years on September 12. A second offer, which promised a 35 percent pay rise, was rejected by nearly two-thirds of members last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The union has consistently asked for a 40 percent salary increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn't be right as we have achieved so much success," the union said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the 38 percent wage increase, members will be entitled to a US$12,000 ratification bonus, up from US$7,000 in the previous offer, Boeing said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We encourage all of our employees to learn more about the improved offer and vote on Monday, November 4," Boeing said in a statement. (AFP)

    Wall Street slumps on sell-off of tech giants

 Major US stock indexes closed lower on Thursday after Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms and Microsoft fell, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks also slipped. Amazon and Apple dropped ahead of their quarterly results. Shares of Alphabet, which reported on Tuesday, also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  "You had three of the Magnificent Seven all say they basically have open-ended budgets for AI spend and investors don't like to hear that," said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The intermediate and longer-term implications of this buildout are really important for US long-term growth and long-term productivity. ... In the short run, investors are asking where's the profit from it?"
  <br>
  <br>
  Microsoft and Meta both said their capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could reduce profitability.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell 0.9 percent, to finish at 41,763. The S&amp;P lost 1.9 percent, to 5,705, and the Nasdaq fell 2.8 percent, to 18,095.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2 percent in September, in line with economists' expectations. However, the core figure was 2.7 percent year-over-year, slightly above the 2.6 percent forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 25-basis-point rate reduction in the Fed's November meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do expect them to cut by a quarter (percentage point) next week because there is nothing in the data this week that should throw them off of that," Schleif said. (Reuters)

    HK economy grows 1.8 percent in Q3

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew by 1.8 percent in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official figures released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Growth was slower than the previous two quarters – the second quarter saw a 3.2 percent expansion and first quarter GDP grew by 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, the government said growth in exports was down, while private consumption expenditure continued to decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials said the local economy will continue to grow.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While global economic uncertainties and trade conflicts may affect Hong Kong's exports of goods, monetary easing across major central banks and an improved outlook for the mainland economy following the recent introduction of a wide range of stimulus measures would help support sentiment and activities in the domestic market," the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government had projected the economy to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  Samuel Tse, an economist at DBS Bank, said he expects the economy to improve in the fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think the economy hasn't been doing well in the past few quarters. But I think for the fourth quarter, it will be doing a little bit better, given the interest rate cut cycle from the Fed (US Federal Reserve) has already commenced. Mainland China has also started their stimulus packages," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "So, these will be translating into some positive effects onto the consumption as well as the investment."

    COMAC opens new office in Hong Kong
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777021-20241031.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese aircraft manufacturer said on Thursday that it has opened its second office outside the mainland in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) launched its Hong Kong office after establishing one in Singapore on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The move is seen as a way to expand the planemaker's reach overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Wednesday, COMAC signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Swire Pacific’s aircraft maintenance business, HAECO, to collaborate on airframe, engine and component services.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The MOU will enable the two parties to jointly deliver more comprehensive support towards COMAC’s domestic and international customers," HAECO said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This partnership marks a significant step forward in enhancing aircraft maintenance capabilities in the region, ensuring that both organisations can effectively support the evolving landscape of the aviation industry."
  <br>
  <br>
  HAECO also said the agreements come in response to the growing maintenance demands for COMAC's two commercial aircraft models, the C919 and ARJ21.
  <br>
  <br>
  There have been two demonstration flights of COMAC's C919 jet in Hong Kong over the past year, but no COMAC planes currently fly to the SAR or have been ordered by Hong Kong-based airlines. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Bank of Japan warns of 'high uncertainties'
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1777014-20241031.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bank of Japan warned on Thursday of "high uncertainties" following the ruling party's worst election result in 15 years, as it kept interest rates unchanged.
 <br>
  <br>
  Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in Sunday's snap vote, likely forcing him to head a minority government with support from other parties to pass legislation.
  <br>
  <br>
  Businesses and economists worry that as concessions to other parties, Ishiba, 67, will offer tax cuts and higher spending, and go slow on reforms needed to improve Japan's competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are also concerns that the government may pressure the BoJ to take a break from the gradual normalisation begun this year of its ultra-loose monetary policy, even if it leads to a weaker yen.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the opposition Democratic Party for the People (DPP) – which Ishiba has been courting for support – on Tuesday urged the BoJ "to avoid making big policy changes now".
  <br>
  <br>
  For a long time, the BoJ was an outlier among major central banks, sticking to its ultra-loose policy to spur inflation after the "lost decades" of stagnant or falling prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ ditched negative rates in March, lifting borrowing costs for the first time since 2007 and then again in July – signalling more was to come.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ on Thursday kept its main short-term policy rate at 0.25 percent, as widely expected, warning of "high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices".
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank also said it was paying "due attention" to other economies, particularly the United States ahead of presidential elections on November 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  The BoJ again signalled that it would raise borrowing costs if inflation develops as it expects, saying the Japanese economy "is likely to keep growing at a pace above its potential growth rate".
  <br>
  <br>
  The central bank said it expected inflation of 2.5 percent for the current fiscal year to March 2025 before moderating to two percent in the following two years. (AFP)

    China factory output expands first time in 6 months
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776995-20241031.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing output returned to the expansion zone in October after five consecutive months of contraction, official data showed on Thursday, signalling positive news for the world's second largest economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  In a statement, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 50.1 in October, up from 49.8 in September and surpassing the boom-or-bust line of 50 for the first time since May.
  <br>
  <br>
  Commenting on the data, NBS statistician, Zhao Qinghe, said China's economic sentiment continued to improve in October as a new package of incremental policies were rolled out and existing policies also gradually took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The October data also outperformed a forecast of 49.9 by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
  <br>
  <br>
  A breakdown of the data showed that railway transport, water transport, air transport, postal services, capital market services and ecological conservation recorded an expansion in October, while those related to wholesale, accommodation, internet software and information technology services, property sector, and resident services logged contraction.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has in recent weeks unveiled a slew of measures to funnel cash into the economy, including several key rate cuts and looser restrictions on home-buying, and is targeting annual growth this year of around five percent. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    US stocks slip as markets assess company earnings

 Wall Street stocks closed lower on Wednesday despite positive US economic data, as investors assessed company earnings including reports after the bell by major tech names Facebook-parent Meta and Microsoft.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones retreated 0.2 percent to 42,141, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.3 percent to 5,813.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq lost 0.6 percent to 18,607.
  <br>
  <br>
  The market appears to be searching for a "next catalyst" to determine if it can keep moving higher, said Patrick O'Hare of Briefing.com.
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, he added, "Alphabet is doing very well on the back of its earnings report. But at the same time, you have some other earnings results that were not received quite as well."
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Google-parent Alphabet closed 2.9 percent higher, a day after it reported solid third quarter results with revenue climbing 15 percent from a year ago to US$88.3 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  But other companies saw their share prices drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in Caterpillar, which makes construction and mining equipment, lost 2.1 percent as it reported a drop in sales and lowered its revenue outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices fell 10.6 percent although its results came in slightly above expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  In after-hours trading, Meta shares fell more than two percent shortly after reporting profits that surpassed market expectations, while Microsoft gained 0.8 percent on strong growth in its cloud computing and artificial intelligence businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The performance of Wall Street came despite the US economy expanding 2.8 percent in the third quarter according to government data.
  <br>
  <br>
  This was a solid figure although a slight slowdown from the previous quarter. Data from payroll firm ADP also showed private sector hiring surged more than expected. (AFP)

    BYD beats Tesla in quarterly revenue for 1st time

<div class="itemFullText">
 Electric vehicle giant BYD reported surging sales on Wednesday, surpassing global rival Tesla in quarterly revenue for the first time as its push into overseas markets advances.
 <br>
  <br>
  The EV and battery giant is a leading player in recent efforts by Chinese automotive firms to expand overseas.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD posted operating revenue of 201.1 billion yuan, or US$28.2 billion, during the third quarter, a filing at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange showed, up 24 percent from the same period last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Shenzhen-based firm's quarterly revenue figure for the first time exceeded that of American EV powerhouse Tesla, which last week posted US$25.2 billion in third-quarter revenue.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm's net profit during the period came in at 11.6 billion yuan, the filing showed, up 11.5 percent from the third quarter last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  BYD – which adopts the English slogan "Build Your Dreams" – is the most prominent EV manufacturer in China, the world's largest automotive market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Originally specialising in the design and production of batteries, BYD diversified into the automotive industry in 2003. (AFP)

    'Debut of Saudi ETFs tracking HK shares a milestone'
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776873-20241030.htm

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the debut of Saudi Arabia's first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track Hong Kong-listed equities will strengthen cooperation between the two places.
 <br>
  <br>
  Chan's remark came as trading of such ETFs began on the Saudi stock exchange.
  <br>
  <br>
  Issuer Albilad Capital and its partner CSOP Asset Management said the trading of the product raised more than US$1.2 billion at the start.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters in Riyadh after the listing ceremony, Chan said the ETFs open doors for Middle Eastern investors to capital markets beyond the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Middle Eastern investors can gain easy access to our Hong Kong markets. However, this investment extends beyond just Hong Kong. As you know, more than 70 percent of the market value of listed companies in Hong Kong comes from the mainland. Therefore, investing in the Hong Kong market is equivalent to investing in key sectors of the mainland," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asia's first ETF covering Saudi Arabian stocks made its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last November. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    HKEX to open Riyadh office in 2025

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s stock market operator on Wednesday said it will open an office in Riyadh next year, boosting its global coverage.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) said the new office in the Saudi Arabian capital would help investors in the Middle East better access financial products and capital markets in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Its CEO Bonnie Chan pointed out that the Riyadh branch will join HKEX’s other offices in Beijing, Shanghai, London, New York, and Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The new Riyadh office will enable us to foster greater global coverage and facilitate access for Middle East clients to Asia’s most international, diverse and liquid capital markets in Hong Kong."
  <br>
  <br>
  The announcement came as the trading of Saudi Arabia’s first exchange-traded fund that tracks Hong Kong-listed shares kicked off.

    Growing interest in trading in own currency, says FS

<div class="itemFullText">
 There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
 <br>
  <br>
  At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
  <br>
  <br>
  During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
  <br>
  <br>
  The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between Beijing and Riyadh.

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776781-20241030.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
 <br>
  <br>
  Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Commerce Ministry said China "does not approve of or accept" the move, according to Xinhua News Agency.
  <br>
  <br>
  A ministry spokesperson added that Beijing has already appealed to the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement mechanism over the issue, and will continue to take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
  <br>
  <br>
  "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
  <br>
  <br>
  The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
  <br>
  <br>
  European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
  <br>
  <br>
  It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
  <br>
  <br>
  Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

    Nasdaq ends at record as tech giants start reporting

 The Nasdaq pushed to a record high on Tuesday despite a pullback in the Dow, as markets greeted a series of earnings from technology heavyweights.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Google parent Alphabet rose in after-hours trading following its earnings report, which will be succeeded later this week by releases from Apple, Microsoft and others.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tech stocks are catching a bid," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that there has been "more good news than bad" today.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.8 percent at 18,712,
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones declined 0.4 percent to 42,233, while the S&amp;P 500 added 0.2 percent at 5,832.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hogan pointed to another decline in oil prices as supportive of stocks and noted that US Treasury bond yields were stable.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month, another positive for stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, Ford fell 8.4 percent after reporting solid third-quarter earnings, but lowering some of its full-year projections, implying a weaker fourth quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Boeing shot up 1.5 percent after it announced it will raise more than initially expected from a new stock offering as it seeks to offset crushing production woes and a major strike. The aerospace giant now expects to raise at least US$21 billion from the campaign. (AFP)

    HSBC books 10pc profit rise for Q3

<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings posted a 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as its wealth and wholesale banking benefited from slower-than-expected rate cuts while it embarks on one of the largest overhauls in its history.
 <br>
  <br>
  Europe's largest bank posted pretax profit of US$8.5 billion for the July-to-September period versus US$7.7 billion a year earlier. The result compared with a US$7.6 billion mean average of broker estimates compiled by HSBC.
  <br>
  <br>
  The London-headquartered, Asia-focused bank also announced an additional share buyback of up to US$3 billion, on top of a US$6 billion buyback programme announced earlier this year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The lender unveiled a roadmap for its sweeping restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery designed to control costs and improve efficiency. HSBC announced last week that it will merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into East and West, under a new leadership structure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will begin to implement these plans immediately," Elhedery said in an earnings statement, but further details will be disclosed in February next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  HSBC kept its 2024 and 2025 near-term return on tangible equity goal – a performance target – at mid-teens for two years but said in the statement that the "the outlook for interest rates has changed, and been volatile". (Reuters)

 Wall Street stocks climbed on Monday at the start of a heavy week of earnings and economic data, while markets also monitor the finale of the US presidential campaign.
 <br>
  <br>
  Analysts pointed to a pullback in oil prices as supportive of equities even though US Treasury yields pushed higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's just a continuation of good economic news," said Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer of FNBO, pointing to broadly higher earnings so far and expectations for additional easing of US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.7 percent at 42,387.57.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.3 percent to 4,823.52, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also advanced 0.3 percent to 18,567.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets are eyeing the earnings reports of major tech companies this week including Apple, Amazon and Facebook-parent Meta.
  <br>
  <br>
  Others reporting results include McDonald's, ExxonMobil and Pfizer.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US government will also be releasing its third quarter GDP growth estimate this week, as well as its monthly labour market report -- closely watched for its bearing on the central bank's interest rate policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, aviation giant Boeing, which announced a stock offering that is expected to raise up to $19 billion, saw its shares slide 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Boeing last week reported a major quarterly loss and has been reeling from a workers' strike. (AFP)

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776560-20241028.htm

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
 <br>
  <br>
  Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
  <br>
  <br>
  Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

    BHP, Vale agree to nearly US$30b payout
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776399-20241027.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
 <br>
  <br>
  President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
  <br>
  <br>
  The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
  <br>
  <br>
  BHP denies responsibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
  <br>
  <br>
  The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over 600 people were left homeless.
  <br>
  <br>
  Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
  <br>
  <br>
  BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
 <br>
  <br>
  Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
  <br>
  <br>
  Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
  <br>
  <br>
  Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
  <br>
  <br>
  Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&amp;P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

    Russia hikes interest rates to 21%, highest since 2003
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1776235-20241026.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
  <br>
  <br>
  They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
  <br>
  <br>
  But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

    Apple to take bigger bite of China market

 Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Apple is welcome to deepen its presence in China in talks with the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br>
  Cook, for his part, pledged to increase investment in China.
  <br>
  <br>
  At their meeting in Beijing on Friday, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Apple's business in China as well as China-US economic and trade relations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang said Beijing is willing to help return bilateral economic and trade ties to a healthy and stable track through regular exchanges between government officials and firms, and provide quality services for foreign enterprises.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China will further optimise its business environment and continue to provide high-quality services for foreign-funded firms," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wang added that Apple is welcome to maintain stable cooperation with Chinese partners to achieve common development.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cook said China's rapid development helps Apple achieve fast and sustainable growth, and the company will continue to serve as a bridge between Beijing and Washington in economic and trade issues. (Xinhua and agencies)

  On the final day of his stay, Chan met representatives from several family offices at a breakfast meeting, introducing them to Hong Kong's advantages as a global hub for asset and wealth management, as well as the latest developments in this field.
  <br>
  <br>
  Before leaving New York, Chan toured a local startup accelerator platform, Newlab, and told them about Hong Kong’s plan to establish more accelerator bases to support the growth of startups. The finance minister also invited the platform to consider setting up a base in the SAR.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in his trip, Chan met local political and business figures, think tanks, as well as financial and banking professionals to address their questions and brief them about Hong Kong’s latest situation and opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  He also held discussions about China-US economic and trade relations with Acting Consul General of China in New York Ma Xiaoxiao.

    Nasdaq, S&amp;P powered by surge in Tesla

<img alt="Wall Street's key indices have eased from record levels in recent sessions. File photo: Reuters" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&amp;we&amp;h=1080&amp;output=webp&amp;trim=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776097_2_20241025053532.jpg&amp;q=70">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 gained on Thursday, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields from a three-month high, which buoyed market sentiment despite declines from some corporate results.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Tesla soared, with the EV-maker set to add more than US$140 billion to its market capitalization, after it reported robust third-quarter profits and surprised investors with a prediction of 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year.
  <br>
  <br>
  This helped take the Consumer Discretionary sector higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It was a blowout from the perspective of Tesla," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark S&amp;P posted its first daily gain this week. However, sentiment was somewhat shaky. Most of the S&amp;P sectors were in the red, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still high Treasury yields weighed.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.20 percent, after reaching a three-month high the day before. It went as high as 4.26 percent in Wednesday's session, which saw all three major equity indexes lose ground.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the near term, the greatest influence we've seen in stocks in October has been the move higher in rates. From a 10-year Treasury below 4 percent to where we stand now has been relatively quickly," said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earnings announced before the bell include IBM, which lost after missing third-quarter revenue estimates, while Honeywell declined after it forecast annual sales below estimates, with both weighing on the blue-chip Dow.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow fell a third of a percent to 42,374. The S&amp;P gained a fifth of a percent to end at 5,809, while the Nasdaq gained 0.76 percent to 18,415.
  <br>
  <br>
  Materials dropped, dragged down by Newmont as higher costs and weaker Nevada output saw it miss profit estimates. Boeing also lost after factory workers voted on Wednesday to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week-long strike.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Weekly jobless claims also fell unexpectedly for the week ended Oct. 19. (Reuters)

    US stocks slide on interest rate concerns

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks closed decidedly lower on Wednesday as investors adjusted their expectations for bold central bank interest rate cuts, while major tech names came under pressure.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended 1.0 percent down at 42,514, while the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.9 percent to 5,797.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq plunged 1.6 percent to 18,276.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses came as US Treasury yields climbed.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The economic reports are such that people are losing faith in the idea that we're going to get aggressive rate cuts," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another possible reason for the increase in yields is the US presidential election outcome next month, he said, noting that "neither candidate is talking about anything resembling fiscal discipline."
  <br>
  <br>
  There could be "nervousness" that inflation might creep back in, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several major firms came under pressure as well, with tech giant Apple's shares down 2.2 percent and Nvidia shares losing 2.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fast food giant McDonald's slumped 5.1 percent amid a severe E coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Boeing closed 1.8 percent down after reporting a whopping US$6.2 billion quarterly loss as a labour strike bogged down its commercial plane division. (AFP)

    Nation's industry chief meets Apple boss in Beijing
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775803-20241023.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's industry chief told Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing on Wednesday that he hoped the US tech giant would continue to deepen its presence in the country, an official statement on their meeting showed.
 <br>
  <br>
  China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.
  <br>
  <br>
  Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped "Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market", according to a ministry statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jin also said he hoped Apple would "increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment".
  <br>
  <br>
  "We will continue to expand high-level opening up," Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a "better environment" for global investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's meeting saw the two exchange views on topics including "Apple's development in China, network data security management, [and] cloud services", the statement said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Cook is visiting China for the second time this year, a trip that has seen him meet with university students and try out the iPhone 16's camera in a historic Beijing district with fashion photographer Chen Man.
  <br>
  <br>
  The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.
  <br>
  <br>
  The firm fell to number six in a ranking of smartphone vendors in China during the second quarter of the year – from number three during the same period last year – according to analysis firm Canalys. (AFP)

    Tokyo Metro shares rocket higher on debut
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775777-20241023.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
 <br>
  <br>
  In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
  <br>
  <br>
  The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
  <br>
  <br>
  To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
  <br>
  <br>
  The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
  <br>
  <br>
  London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
  <br>
  <br>
  Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
  <br>
  <br>
  The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

    US stocks shrug off higher bond yields, ending flat

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished with little change on Tuesday, digesting a trove of mostly solid earnings while shrugging off higher treasury bond yields.
 <br>
  <br>
  After opening lower, major indices pushed into positive territory in the afternoon before losing steam after that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The market is just kind of grinding and not doing a whole lot," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's indicative of a market taking a step back."
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended essentially unchanged at 42,924.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,851, while the Nasdaq added 0.2 percent at 18,573.
  <br>
  <br>
  The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I think that there's a tension between the fact that yields are rising which obviously means that bonds are more competitive with stocks," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  "On the other hand, it's also indicative that the economy might be stronger than we thought it may have been. So you have that tension there."
  <br>
  <br>
  Among individual companies, General Motors shot up around 10 percent as it raised its full-year forecast, reflecting strong vehicle pricing that boosted third-quarter earnings.
  <br>
  <br>
  But GE Aerospace slumped 9.1 percent despite increasing its annual projections amid strong demand. However, analysts pointed to lingering concerns connected to a Boeing strike that has shuttered two US plane production plants. (AFP)

    HSBC restructures operations in overhaul
   
   
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775688-20241022.htm
   
   
    
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday it would combine its commercial and investment banking operations in a major overhaul under new CEO Georges Elhedery that has also seen key senior staff depart.
 <br>
  <br>
  Seeking to simplify the Asia-focused bank's business and reduce costs, HSBC said it would be restructuring into four business units and slashing senior management positions.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new leadership structure, which includes the appointment of Pam Kaur as the lender's first female chief financial officer, would "unleash our full potential and drive success into the future," Elhedery said in a memo to staff.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elhedery, like many bank executives, is under pressure to address climbing costs and better manage expenses.
  <br>
  <br>
  The group is carving up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. The new corporate and institutional banking unit will house a newly combined commercial banking and global banking and markets business, and western wholesale banking businesses, including Europe and the Americas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Kaur, 60, who currently serves as HSBC's chief risk and compliance officer, joined the bank in April 2013 as group head of internal audit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jon Bingham, interim Group CFO, will resume his role of Global Financial Controller, HSBC said.
  <br>
  <br>
  In other key management changes, Greg Guyett, CEO Global Banking and Markets, will assume a newly created role of Chair, Strategic Clients Group. Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank and Europe, has decided to step down to pursue other opportunities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The bank, which employs about 214,000 people globally, has been removing duplicate roles for years and reducing its businesses in Western markets such as the United States, France and Canada as it focuses on Asia and markets where it has scale. (Reuters)

 Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
 <br>
  <br>
  Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
  <br>
  <br>
  The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
  <br>
  <br>
  McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

    US markets retreat as investors eye earnings reports

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 retreated from records on Monday as treasury bond yields rose in the first session of a heavy week of earnings reports.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Perhaps the market is reacting to higher bond yields and higher oil prices," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, said of the mostly down session.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.8 percent at 42,931.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,853.98, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 18,540.01.
  <br>
  <br>
  Analysts described a relatively light day in terms of economic news, with the main story that China's central bank had cut two key interest rates in a move to stimulate the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ablin said many investors are "sitting tight" with the US presidential election now in its home stretch.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It just seems like an awkward time to be making big bets," he said. "We'll know a lot more in two weeks we hope."

  Among individual companies, Boeing rose 3.1 percent after labour negotiators agreed to present a new contract to 33,000 Seattle-area workers, potentially resolving the month-long machinist union strike.

  Disney shed 0.6 percent after announcing that it plans to name a new CEO in early 2026. The company named former Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman as chairperson, replacing former Nike CEO Mark Parker.

    Central bank cuts two key rates

 China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
 <br>
  <br>
  The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
  <br>
  <br>
  The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
  <br>
  <br>
  It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
  <br>
  <br>
  Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
  <br>
  <br>
  Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
  <br>
  <br>
  Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)
