  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   There's growing interest for jurisdictions to conduct trade in their own currency, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday, adding that a multi-central bank digital currency platform is "worth pushing forward".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the annual Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia, Chan said Hong Kong has been involved in the mBridge project, a platform supporting cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions using central bank digital currencies and distributed ledger technology.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "A lot of jurisdictions want to trade in their own currency. So the challenge is how to create a system to take care of that," Chan said in Riyadh.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Say, for example, Hong Kong, along with Saudi Arabia and a few other jurisdictions, we have an mBridge project facilitating trade settlements. I mean trading transactions denominated in their own local currency. And through digitalisation this can be settled by using their own currency. And this is gaining increasing confidence and increasing interest."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the summit, Chan witnessed the signing of a strategic cooperation agreement between Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks and Beta Lab, a startup incubator in Saudi Arabia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The financial chief is leading a 100-strong delegation to the Saudi capital for three days, after taking the first direct passenger flight between the SAR and Riyadh since 2017.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We're meeting with business, finance and technology companies, with investors and government leaders, too. Our goal is clear: To expand ties with Saudi Arabia, building friendship and exploring the many mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities this renewed connection will surely create," Chan told a cocktail reception.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also said the resumption of flights between the two cities "underlines the strategic importance" of Saudi Arabia's location "at the crossroad between three continents", while boosting ties between the Kingdom and China.

    EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs by up to 45.3 percent

  <img alt="China-made Teslas will be taxed an addition 7.8 percent, Chinese car giant Geely faces an extra duty of 18.8 percent, while SAIC will be hit with the highest at 35.3 percent.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The European Union has decided to increase tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles to as much as 45.3 percent, at the end of its highest profile investigation that has divided Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Just over a year after launching its anti-subsidy probe, the European Commission will set out extra tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for China's SAIC, on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs were formally approved and published in the EU's Official Journal on Tuesday, meaning they will take effect on Wednesday. The Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, has said tariffs are required to counter what it says are unfair subsidies including preferential financing and grants as well as land, batteries and raw materials at below market prices.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The China Chamber of Commerce to the EU said it was profoundly disappointed by the "protectionist" and "arbitrary" EU measure and was disheartened by the lack of substantial progress in negotiations to find an alternative to tariffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has launched its own probes this year into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products. It has also challenged the EU's provisional measures at the World Trade Organisation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra taxes have been controversial, with strong opposition from Germany and Hungary amid fears that it may set off a trade war. Beijing previously slammed the European Union's "unfair" and "unreasonable protectionist practices" during the probe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "By adopting these proportionate and targeted measures after a rigorous investigation, we're standing up for fair market practices and for the European industrial base," EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We welcome competition, including in the electric vehicle sector, but it must be underpinned by fairness and a level playing field," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Germany's main auto industry association warned the tariffs heighten the risk of "a far-reaching trade conflict".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The extra tariffs are "a step backwards for free global trade and thus for prosperity, job preservation and growth in Europe," the German Association of the Automotive Industry's president Hildegard Mueller said after the announcement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   European automakers are grappling with an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. The Commission estimates Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It says prices are typically 20 percent below those of EU-made models.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It remains to be seen what impact tariffs will have on consumer prices. Some producers may be able to absorb them at least partially.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Talks continue between the EU and China and the duties can be lifted if they reach a satisfactory agreement, but officials on both sides have pointed to differences.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the first nine months of 2024, China's EV exports to the EU were down 7 percent from a year earlier, but they have surged by more than a third in August and September, ahead of the tariffs, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) show. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq pushed to a record high on Tuesday despite a pullback in the Dow, as markets greeted a series of earnings from technology heavyweights.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Google parent Alphabet rose in after-hours trading following its earnings report, which will be succeeded later this week by releases from Apple, Microsoft and others.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tech stocks are catching a bid," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management, adding that there has been "more good news than bad" today.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tech-rich Nasdaq finished up 0.8 percent at 18,712,
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones declined 0.4 percent to 42,233, while the S&P 500 added 0.2 percent at 5,832.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hogan pointed to another decline in oil prices as supportive of stocks and noted that US Treasury bond yields were stable.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month, another positive for stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Ford fell 8.4 percent after reporting solid third-quarter earnings, but lowering some of its full-year projections, implying a weaker fourth quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But Boeing shot up 1.5 percent after it announced it will raise more than initially expected from a new stock offering as it seeks to offset crushing production woes and a major strike. The aerospace giant now expects to raise at least US$21 billion from the campaign. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings posted a 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as its wealth and wholesale banking benefited from slower-than-expected rate cuts while it embarks on one of the largest overhauls in its history.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Europe's largest bank posted pretax profit of US$8.5 billion for the July-to-September period versus US$7.7 billion a year earlier. The result compared with a US$7.6 billion mean average of broker estimates compiled by HSBC.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The London-headquartered, Asia-focused bank also announced an additional share buyback of up to US$3 billion, on top of a US$6 billion buyback programme announced earlier this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lender unveiled a roadmap for its sweeping restructuring under new CEO Georges Elhedery designed to control costs and improve efficiency. HSBC announced last week that it will merge some operations and split its geographic footprint into East and West, under a new leadership structure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will begin to implement these plans immediately," Elhedery said in an earnings statement, but further details will be disclosed in February next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   HSBC kept its 2024 and 2025 near-term return on tangible equity goal – a performance target – at mid-teens for two years but said in the statement that the "the outlook for interest rates has changed, and been volatile". (Reuters)

   Wall Street stocks climbed on Monday at the start of a heavy week of earnings and economic data, while markets also monitor the finale of the US presidential campaign.

   Analysts pointed to a pullback in oil prices as supportive of equities even though US Treasury yields pushed higher.
   <br/>

   "It's just a continuation of good economic news," said Kurt Spieler, chief investment officer of FNBO, pointing to broadly higher earnings so far and expectations for additional easing of US monetary policy.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Others reporting results include McDonald's, ExxonMobil and Pfizer.

    Fast payments to mainland banks possible in 2025: HKMA

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Monetary Authority on Monday said that locals will soon be able to transfer small amounts of money to mainland accounts through a scheme similar to the Faster Payment System (FPS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its chief executive Eddie Yue said officials are working with their mainland counterparts on the details, and a trial scheme could kick off in the middle of next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the sidelines of the Hong Kong Fintech Week, Yue told reporters that cross-border transfers could be done around the clock and could be made to an account that is linked with a mainland phone number, much like how FPS operates.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, the Securities and Futures Commission said it will consult the trade early next year in creating the roadmap for a new regulatory regime for virtual asset trading platforms.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Currently, three such licences have been approved, with the commission saying it is processing more applications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SFC’s intermediaries executive director, Eric Yip, said all licensees will be invited to take part in the consultative panel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We expect the panel deliberation will result in a comprehensive virtual assets white paper that outlines the development roadmap for products and services, as well as potential enhancement in compliance and risk management," he said in his speech at Fintech Week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Next is our work to piece the rest of the regulatory regime puzzle. To establish a comprehensive framework for virtual assets, we should make reference to how trading, settlement, and custody work in the traditional securities market."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yip added that the commission will step up investor education regarding virtual assets, as well as its monitoring of suspicious platforms and alerting investors of potential harm.

  <img alt="Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends a signing ceremony for an agreement between Vale and BHP and Brazilian authorities. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1776399_1_20241027084829.jpg&q=80" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mining giants BHP and Vale have signed a deal with Brazil's government to pay nearly US$30 billion in damages for a 2015 dam collapse that triggered the country's worst environmental disaster.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the signing of the deal over the November 5, 2015 collapse of a tailings dam at a mine in the southeastern town of Mariana, which triggered a giant mudslide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The river of mud swamped villages, rivers and rainforest, killing 19 people on its way to the sea.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope the mining companies have learned their lesson: it would have cost them less to prevent (the disaster), much less," Lula said at the ceremony attended by representatives of Brazil's Vale and Australia's BHP, co-owners of the Brazilian company Samarco that operated the iron mine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The agreement, which Lula declared to be the biggest environmental payout in modern history, comes on the fifth day of a separate mega-trial in London over BHP's role in the dam's failure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   More than 620,000 complainants, including 46 Brazilian municipalities and several Indigenous communities, are seeking an estimated 36 billion pounds (US$47 million) in damages in the civil trial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP denies responsibility.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The company said on Friday that the agreement reached in Brasilia did not end the lawsuits pending against the companies, nor prevent others being taken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dam's failure released a torrent of over 40 million cubic meters of highly toxic sludge, the equivalent of 12,000 Olympic swimming pools, which coursed through the Doce River all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, over 600 kilometres away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Over 600 people were left homeless.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Scientists say the mouth of the Doce River and parts of the southeast Atlantic coastline are still contaminated with metals from the spill, affecting the area's population of fish, birds, turtles, porpoises and whales.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BHP and Vale had already agreed in 2016 to pay 20 billion reais (about US$3.5 billion at today's rate) in damages, but the negotiations were reopened in 2021 due to what the government called their "non-compliance" and the slow progress of Brazil's justice system in resolving the dispute.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Friday's agreement in Brazil, which is subject to approval by the country's Supreme Court, covers the companies' past and future obligations to assist people, communities and ecosystems affected by the disaster. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq ended higher on Friday, driven by megacap shares, as investors awaited quarterly results from some of Wall Street's biggest companies next week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tesla shares rose 3.36 percent a day after surging 22 percent on the electric vehicle maker's sales forecast. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft also rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Tesla numbers helped rekindle some optimism of investors that the Magnificent Seven rally is not over," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He was referring to the group of interest rate-sensitive technology stocks which have surged on enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Chip heavyweight Nvidia gained, briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company based on its shares.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged higher as investors awaited US employment data next week for clues on the likely path of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier this week, the yield reached a three-month high of 4.26 percent, weighing on the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61 percent to 42,114. The S&P 500 lost 0.03 percent to 5,808, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.56 percent, to 18,518.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow was dragged down by banking shares, with Goldman Sachs down 2.27 percent, and it was also hit by a 2.97 percent fall in fast-food chain McDonald's, which has been hit by an E. coli outbreak linked to its hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Banks have rallied as (US presidential candidate Donald) Trump's odds (of winning) increased, so it seems investors are taking some profits," said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Regional lender New York Community Bancorp dropped 8.26 percent after reporting its fourth straight quarterly loss, primarily due to its commercial real estate loans.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Continued uncertainty around the US election has made investors cautious.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equities have been unsettled this week by a rapid rise in yields as bets on rate cuts by the Fed unraveled on expectations of a stronger economic outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only the Nasdaq closed the week with gains. The tech-heavy index rose 0.16 percent, while the S&P fell 0.96 percent and the Dow sank 2.68 percent. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Russia's central bank hiked interest rates to 21 percent on Friday, taking borrowing costs to their highest level in more than 20 years amid surging inflation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rise takes rates above an emergency level introduced in February 2022 – just after Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine – and to their highest since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Further tightening of monetary policy is required to ensure the return of inflation to the target and reduce inflation expectations," the bank said in a statement announcing the increase.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank directly blamed high government spending for inflation and said it could hike rates yet again if the pace of price rises does not cool.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Additional fiscal spending and the related expansion of the federal budget deficit in 2024 have pro-inflationary effects," it said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inflation has surged amid a massive increase in government spending on the Ukraine offensive that has triggered labour shortages across the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Price rises were running at 8.6 percent on an annual basis in September, more than double the official 4.0-percent target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Russian lawmakers voted on Thursday to increase defence expenditure by almost 30 percent next year, another sign Moscow is not planning to halt its spending on the offensive, grinding through its third year, anytime soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several sectors of the economy are facing intense labour shortages, as hundreds of thousands of men have been called up to fight, fled the country or been recruited by a booming domestic weapons' industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   That has created strong growth despite an unprecedented package of Western sanctions that Washington hoped would cripple the Russian economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The International Monetary Fund this week raised its growth forecast for Russia in 2024 to 3.6 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But it has also led to a cycle of spiralling wages and prices that the Central Bank has long warned undermines economic stability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official borrowing costs in Russia have not been above 20 percent since 2003.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They regularly topped 100 percent throughout the 1990s, a decade of economic volatility and hardship following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For years President Vladimir Putin has boasted of economic stability under his leadership, with his first years in office in the 2000s seeing an oil-led boom and rising wealth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But his conflict in Ukraine has threatened Moscow's future prosperity, cutting it off from lucrative Western export markets and much of the global financial system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Putin had hoped to advance plans for alternative international payment systems at the Brics summit in Kazan this week, the largest diplomatic gathering in Russia since the start of the offensive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But speaking on Thursday, he indicated little progress had been made on talks over launching a possible competitor to the Belgium-based Swift financial messaging system.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for Swift and any alternatives, we have not created and are not creating any alternatives," Putin told reporters at the end of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "One of the key problems today is the problem of payments, that is why we are moving towards the use of national currencies," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As for a unified Brics currency, we are not considering that question at the moment," he added. (AFP)

   Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Apple is welcome to deepen its presence in China in talks with the tech giant's CEO Tim Cook in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook, for his part, pledged to increase investment in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At their meeting in Beijing on Friday, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Apple's business in China as well as China-US economic and trade relations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang said Beijing is willing to help return bilateral economic and trade ties to a healthy and stable track through regular exchanges between government officials and firms, and provide quality services for foreign enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China will further optimise its business environment and continue to provide high-quality services for foreign-funded firms," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang added that Apple is welcome to maintain stable cooperation with Chinese partners to achieve common development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Cook said China's rapid development helps Apple achieve fast and sustainable growth, and the company will continue to serve as a bridge between Beijing and Washington in economic and trade issues. (Xinhua and agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan has concluded his three-day visit to New York and is expected to be back in Hong Kong on Friday night.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On the final day of his stay, Chan met representatives from several family offices at a breakfast meeting, introducing them to Hong Kong's advantages as a global hub for asset and wealth management, as well as the latest developments in this field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before leaving New York, Chan toured a local startup accelerator platform, Newlab, and told them about Hong Kong’s plan to establish more accelerator bases to support the growth of startups. The finance minister also invited the platform to consider setting up a base in the SAR.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in his trip, Chan met local political and business figures, think tanks, as well as financial and banking professionals to address their questions and brief them about Hong Kong’s latest situation and opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He also held discussions about China-US economic and trade relations with Acting Consul General of China in New York Ma Xiaoxiao.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained on Thursday, driven by Tesla's positive earnings forecast and a decline in Treasury yields from a three-month high, which buoyed market sentiment despite declines from some corporate results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Tesla soared, with the EV-maker set to add more than US$140 billion to its market capitalization, after it reported robust third-quarter profits and surprised investors with a prediction of 20 percent to 30 percent sales growth next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This helped take the Consumer Discretionary sector higher.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was a blowout from the perspective of Tesla," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The benchmark S&P posted its first daily gain this week. However, sentiment was somewhat shaky. Most of the S&P sectors were in the red, as other earnings reports and pressure from lower, but still high Treasury yields weighed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased to 4.20 percent, after reaching a three-month high the day before. It went as high as 4.26 percent in Wednesday's session, which saw all three major equity indexes lose ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the near term, the greatest influence we've seen in stocks in October has been the move higher in rates. From a 10-year Treasury below 4 percent to where we stand now has been relatively quickly," said Bill Northey, senior investment director at US Bank Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earnings announced before the bell include IBM, which lost after missing third-quarter revenue estimates, while Honeywell declined after it forecast annual sales below estimates, with both weighing on the blue-chip Dow.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow fell a third of a percent to 42,374. The S&P gained a fifth of a percent to end at 5,809, while the Nasdaq gained 0.76 percent to 18,415.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Materials dropped, dragged down by Newmont as higher costs and weaker Nevada output saw it miss profit estimates. Boeing also lost after factory workers voted on Wednesday to reject a contract offer and continue a more than five-week-long strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks have eased from record levels over the past few sessions due to a reassessment of bets on the Federal Reserve's rate cuts, rising Treasury yields, corporate earnings and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming US election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Weekly jobless claims also fell unexpectedly for the week ended Oct. 19. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed decidedly lower on Wednesday as investors adjusted their expectations for bold central bank interest rate cuts, while major tech names came under pressure.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended 1.0 percent down at 42,514, while the S&P 500 slid 0.9 percent to 5,797.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq plunged 1.6 percent to 18,276.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The losses came as US Treasury yields climbed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The economic reports are such that people are losing faith in the idea that we're going to get aggressive rate cuts," said Steve Sosnick of Interactive Brokers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another possible reason for the increase in yields is the US presidential election outcome next month, he said, noting that "neither candidate is talking about anything resembling fiscal discipline."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There could be "nervousness" that inflation might creep back in, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major firms came under pressure as well, with tech giant Apple's shares down 2.2 percent and Nvidia shares losing 2.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Fast food giant McDonald's slumped 5.1 percent amid a severe E coli outbreak linked to its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Boeing closed 1.8 percent down after reporting a whopping US$6.2 billion quarterly loss as a labour strike bogged down its commercial plane division. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The nation's industry chief told Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing on Wednesday that he hoped the US tech giant would continue to deepen its presence in the country, an official statement on their meeting showed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China is a vital market for Apple, but recent years have seen the firm battle slumping sales in the face of increasingly stiff competition in the smartphone sector from local rivals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Industry minister Jin Zhuanglong told Cook during a meeting on Wednesday morning that he hoped "Apple will continue to deepen its presence in the Chinese market", according to a ministry statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jin also said he hoped Apple would "increase investment in innovation, grow alongside Chinese firms, and share in the dividends of high-quality investment".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will continue to expand high-level opening up," Jin told Cook, adding that China would strive to provide a "better environment" for global investors.

   The iPhone remains popular among Chinese consumers, but its sales have come under pressure in the country recently from local competitors, including Huawei.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Tokyo Metro shares soared more than 40 percent on their debut on Wednesday after its government owners raised US$2.3 billion in Japan's biggest initial public offering since 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In early trade Tokyo Metro shares were at 1,745 yen (US$11.5), up 45 percent from their issue price of 1,200 yen, with reports saying the issue was 15 times oversubscribed among investors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Proceeds from the IPO will redeem reconstruction bonds issued after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in northeast Japan that killed 18,000 people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The listing reduces government ownership, split between the country and Tokyo city, to around 50 percent. Many Japanese rail operators are already privatised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To attract investors, perks for buying more than 200 shares included tickets to the Tokyo Metro museum and golf range, as well as free tempura toppings at its noodle stands.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The IPO is Japan's largest since tycoon Masayoshi Son's tech and telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group raised a national record of US$23.5 billion by listing its mobile unit in 2018.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   London built the first public underground railway, but in 1927 Tokyo became the first Asian city with a subway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Each day around 6.5 million people ride the Metro's nine lines, which are part of a vast transport network serving the capital and its sprawling suburbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Four other subway lines are run separately by the Tokyo government, alongside private services and East Japan Railway's overground routes such as the Yamanote Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The network's cleanliness and efficiency contrasts with the often creaking infrastructure of other big cities like London, Paris and New York, where many operators are deep in debt.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tokyo Metro posted a net profit of 46.3 billion yen for the fiscal year that ended in March 2024, up 67 percent from a year earlier. This year it is aiming to increase this to 52.3 billion yen. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks finished with little change on Tuesday, digesting a trove of mostly solid earnings while shrugging off higher treasury bond yields.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After opening lower, major indices pushed into positive territory in the afternoon before losing steam after that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The market is just kind of grinding and not doing a whole lot," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management. "It's indicative of a market taking a step back."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones ended essentially unchanged at 42,924.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 5,851, while the Nasdaq added 0.2 percent at 18,573.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The flattish day came as US Treasury yields climbed, a dynamic that has sometimes pressured stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think that there's a tension between the fact that yields are rising which obviously means that bonds are more competitive with stocks," said Tom Cahill of Ventura Wealth Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "On the other hand, it's also indicative that the economy might be stronger than we thought it may have been. So you have that tension there."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, General Motors shot up around 10 percent as it raised its full-year forecast, reflecting strong vehicle pricing that boosted third-quarter earnings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But GE Aerospace slumped 9.1 percent despite increasing its annual projections amid strong demand. However, analysts pointed to lingering concerns connected to a Boeing strike that has shuttered two US plane production plants. (AFP)

    HSBC restructures operations in overhaul

  <div class="itemFullText">
   HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday it would combine its commercial and investment banking operations in a major overhaul under new CEO Georges Elhedery that has also seen key senior staff depart.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Seeking to simplify the Asia-focused bank's business and reduce costs, HSBC said it would be restructuring into four business units and slashing senior management positions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new leadership structure, which includes the appointment of Pam Kaur as the lender's first female chief financial officer, would "unleash our full potential and drive success into the future," Elhedery said in a memo to staff.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elhedery, like many bank executives, is under pressure to address climbing costs and better manage expenses.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group is carving up its operations into four business lines, namely UK, Hong Kong, corporate and institutional banking, and wealth banking. The new corporate and institutional banking unit will house a newly combined commercial banking and global banking and markets business, and western wholesale banking businesses, including Europe and the Americas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kaur, 60, who currently serves as HSBC's chief risk and compliance officer, joined the bank in April 2013 as group head of internal audit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Jon Bingham, interim Group CFO, will resume his role of Global Financial Controller, HSBC said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In other key management changes, Greg Guyett, CEO Global Banking and Markets, will assume a newly created role of Chair, Strategic Clients Group. Colin Bell, CEO of HSBC Bank and Europe, has decided to step down to pursue other opportunities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank, which employs about 214,000 people globally, has been removing duplicate roles for years and reducing its businesses in Western markets such as the United States, France and Canada as it focuses on Asia and markets where it has scale. (Reuters)

  <img alt="Cathay Pacific has rolled out more than HK$100 billion in investments over the next seven years.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330," Lam added.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 retreated from records on Monday as treasury bond yields rose in the first session of a heavy week of earnings reports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Perhaps the market is reacting to higher bond yields and higher oil prices," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Capital Management, said of the mostly down session.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.8 percent at 42,931.60.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 declined 0.2 percent to 5,853.98, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.3 percent at 18,540.01.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts described a relatively light day in terms of economic news, with the main story that China's central bank had cut two key interest rates in a move to stimulate the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ablin said many investors are "sitting tight" with the US presidential election now in its home stretch.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It just seems like an awkward time to be making big bets," he said. "We'll know a lot more in two weeks we hope."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, Boeing rose 3.1 percent after labour negotiators agreed to present a new contract to 33,000 Seattle-area workers, potentially resolving the month-long machinist union strike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Disney shed 0.6 percent after announcing that it plans to name a new CEO in early 2026. The company named former Morgan Stanley chief James Gorman as chairperson, replacing former Nike CEO Mark Parker.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This week's earnings calendar includes reports from General Motors, Boeing, UPS and Tesla. (AFP)

  <img alt="China's central bank has cut the one-year loan prime rate (LPR) to 3.10 percent from 3.35 percent, and the five-year LPR has been cut to 3.6 percent from 3.85 percent.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China cut benchmark lending rates as anticipated at the monthly fixing on Monday, following reductions to other policy rates last month as part of a package of stimulus measures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was "an encouraging sign". "The monetary policy has clearly shifted to a more supportive stance since the press conference on September 24. The real interest rate in China is too high," he said. (Agencies)

  <img alt="Paul Chan echos the Chief Executive's idea of further developing Hong Kong's gold market. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&we&h=1080&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1775354_1_20241020125513.jpg&q=85" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday gold trading in Hong Kong has great room for growth amid global market developments, and building up the SAR's market is of great strategic significance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub," he wrote on his weekly blog.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This, he said, has great strategic significance in raising Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 chalked up record closing highs on Friday, with the Nasdaq also in positive territory, as markets were boosted by an earnings-driven jump in Netflix shares and broader gains across technology stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   All three major Wall Street benchmarks also comfortably secured a sixth straight weekly gain, their longest weekly winning streaks since late 2023.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones rose 0.09 percent s to close at 43,277. The S&P gained 0.4 percent to end at 5,864, while the Nasdaq rose 0.63 percent, to 18,488.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shares of Netflix jumped 11.1 percent to a record closing high after the streaming giant topped Wall Street estimates for subscriber additions and said it expected continued growth through the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks, which have driven much of Wall Street's rally this year, rose.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Apple gained 1.2 percent after data showed a sharp increase in new iPhone sales in China, while chip heavyweight Nvidia advanced 0.8 percent after BofA Global Research hiked its price target on the stock.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Netflix's increase lifted the communication services sector 0.9 percent, making it the largest gainer among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, while information technology rose 0.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It's kind of the 'what's not to like' market," said David Waddell, chief executive of Waddell & Associates, citing positive economic data, disinflation and upbeat earnings and forecasts from corporate America. (Reuters)

   Hong Kong's unemployment rate remained steady at three percent in the three-month period ending in September, which is the same as the June-to-August period.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.2 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said the unemployment rates of various sectors showed diverse movements during the period, although the changes were not significant.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The overall labour market should remain tight in the near term alongside the sustained economic growth, though the employment situation may vary across sectors depending on their business performances,” he said.

    HKMA rolls out measures to support SMEs

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday rolled out new capital rules and various support measures aimed at assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including HK$370 billion in dedicated funds offered by banks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures include allowing banks to apply more favourable capital requirements for larger enterprises.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new regulation, which is set to take effect in January next year, will cover businesses with annual turnover of up to HK$500 million – an increase from the previous cap of HK$100 million.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Countercyclical Capital Buffer has also been reduced from 1 percent to 0.5 percent with immediate effect, allowing banks to lend more freely and reducing their loan costs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The authority added that 16 banks participating in the Taskforce on SME Lending have set aside a total of over HK$370 billion in dedicated funds for SMEs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “About that HK$370 billion dedicated funds for SMEs, that is actually more about a commitment by those banks involved in making sure that the supply of the credit will be there, but of course subject to prudent risk management,” said HKMA executive director Carmen Chu.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A deputy chief executive at the authority, Arthur Yuen, said the dedicated funds are not a static figure and can be adjusted based on market conditions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We will continue to discuss with the banks through the taskforce whether there's any room for further enhancing or increasing that number,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen said the taskforce, established in August, has received over 100 enquiries so far, with almost half requiring no intervention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “But the taskforce did look into the remaining 60 percent of the cases and in some of the cases it involves communications between banks and customers. Some involve the processing time. Some involve the request for documents”, Yuen said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Some also relate to how banks actually interact with customers when they are processing the application, whether they can smoothen some of the requests for information, et cetera. So the taskforce has been involved in sorting out some of those procedural sort of enhancements,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yuen also said the relaunch of the principal moratorium scheme, announced in this year’s Policy Address, will provide “important breathing space” for SMEs to transition.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   SMEs are entitled to the moratorium if they borrow money through the government-backed SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We talked about digital transformation and green transformation, but for SMEs to go through digital transformation and green transformation, they need time, they need continuous support from the banking industry. So having the SFGS principal moratorium re-introduced is an important breathing space for that sort of transformation process to start,” Yuen said.

   Officials addressing a post-data press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, underpinned by further policy support and another cut to the amount banks must hold in reserve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Based on our comprehensive assessment, the economy in the fourth quarter is expected to continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September. We are fully confident in achieving the full-year target," Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The NBS also said in a statement that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For the first three quarters, China's factory output rose 5.8 percent, while retail sales expanded 3.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, property investment sank 10.1 percent and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ahead of the release of the new data, state media said China’s top banks had cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year as part of a move to boost lending.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland policymakers have in recent weeks unveiled a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank on Friday launched one such measure – a swap facility for funds and insurers with an "initial application quota exceeding 200 billion yuan", state media said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The mechanism implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will provide greater liquidity for capital markets, which policymakers hope will offer support for the wider economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And in a possible sign of more relief to come, PBoC chief Pan Gongsheng said on Friday that officials were considering a further cut to the amount commercial lenders must hold in reserve before the end of the year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, China's finance minister pledged to "significantly increase" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package. (Agencies)

    Chinese banks cut interest rates on yuan deposits

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's top banks on Friday cut interest rates on deposits in yuan for the second time this year, state media said, as Beijing seeks to boost sluggish consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks closed in mixed territory on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite once more buoyed by renewed interest in chipmakers and designers like Nvidia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent to end at a new record of 43,239.05, while the S&P 500 Index lost less than 0.1 percent to close at 5,841.47.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meantime, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose less than 0.1 percent to close at 18,373.61, as chip design titan Nvidia saw its share price rise 0.9 percent on the back of a 9.8 percent rise in chipmaker TSMC's shares on strong third quarter results.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Traders were also digesting fresh data published on Thursday showing an acceleration in retail sales last month, and another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank (ECB).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mill Street Research chief strategist Sam Burns told AFP that the positive economic news in the US, and rate cut in Europe, had helped stocks to return to near all-time highs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Earnings reports so far have been pretty good and there doesn't seem to be too much concern, at least so far, about the election and things like that," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among other firms, streaming giant Netflix's shares rose in after-hours trading after it announced it had topped earnings expectations in the third quarter. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Retail sales in the United States accelerated in September, according to government data released on Thursday, even as auto and gas station sales remained tepid for the month -- a positive sign as the election approaches.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Overall sales rose 0.4 percent to US$714.4 billion between August and September, according to Commerce Department data, beating analysts' expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, sales edged up just 0.1 percent to US$711.3 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Excluding auto and gas station sales, the overall monthly rise would have been even higher at 0.7 percent in September, the report added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While the US central bank had kept interest rates high for a large part of the year -- raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to tamp down inflation -- consumer spending has been more robust than expected.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Households have been drawing down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period, and the economy could be given a further boost with the Federal Reserve starting to lower rates more recently.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Compared with the same month a year ago, retail sales were up 1.7 percent in September.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon Macroeconomics noted in a recent report that "with growth in labour income slowing, credit conditions remaining tight and households recently having exhausted their excess savings, we expect growth to slow sharply over the next couple of quarters."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pantheon analysts added that "Hurricane Helene probably landed too late in the month" to have an impact on the sales figures, "and was too localized to have a major impact on national sales." (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   TSMC, the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reported on Thursday a forecast-beating 54 percent jump in third-quarter profit on the back of soaring demand.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI across a spectrum of industries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC posted a net profit of T$325.3 billion (US$10.11 billion) for the quarter which ended September 30, compared with the T$300.2 billion predicted by analysts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said third-quarter revenue rose 36 percent year-on-year to US$23.5 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of up to US$23.2 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories in other parts of the world, including US$65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On its last earnings call in July, TSMC raised its full-year revenue forecast and adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between US$30 billion and US$32 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The AI boom has helped drive up TSMC shares, with its Taipei-listed stock leaping 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 28 percent gain for the broader market, giving it a market capitalisation of around US$840 billion. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.

   Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   US stocks bounced back on Wednesday after retreating a day prior, while earnings season was off to a relatively positive start.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones gained 0.8 percent to 43,077, while the S&P 500 Index added 0.5 percent to 5,842.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq advanced 0.3 percent, closing at 18,367.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks picked up towards the end of the day as investors sought to "buy the dip," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Also, the nuclear stocks are going crazy on the Amazon announcement," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tech giant Amazon announced significant investments in nuclear energy on Wednesday, joining other major companies in aiming to meet the high electric power demands of artificial intelligence using atomic energy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its shares closed 0.4 percent lower.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among companies that reported financial results this week, Morgan Stanley beat estimates with its third quarter report on Wednesday – after quarterly results from Goldman Sachs showed a jump in profits a day earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick said the bank saw a "strong third quarter in a constructive environment," and its shares closed 6.5 percent up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There is "not a lot of conviction after yesterday's chipmaker-led declines," noted Briefing.com on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML saw its shares plunge after it unveiled a cut to its 2025 guidance and slump in sales bookings, sending share prices of other firms falling on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While Nvidia recovered some ground on Wednesday, with its shares up 3.1 percent, ASML and AMD both logged declines still. (AFP)

    Trump's crypto platform falters on first day of sales

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former US president Donald Trump's cryptocurrency platform had a faltering sales launch on Tuesday, with only a fraction of its digital tokens that went on the market finding a buyer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Republican candidate announced in mid-September that he, along with his sons and entrepreneurs, would launch the platform named World Liberty Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some 20 billion digital tokens, priced at 1.5 cents each, were offered by the company – a total value of US$300 million – but just three percent had been purchased by Tuesday evening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tokens can be used as cryptocurrencies and give buyers a vote on the platform's governance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many observers blamed the low sales on technical problems, as the company's website suffered outages earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World Liberty Financial will enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies to or from one another, a service already offered by many platforms, one of the best-known of which is Aave.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During his presidency Trump referred to cryptocurrencies as a scam, but has since radically changed his position, presenting himself as a "pro-bitcoin president" if elected in November. (AFP)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors assessed a series of earnings reports, and with chipmaker equities weakening on news the United States may introduce export curbs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Dow Jones slumped 0.8 percent to 42,740, as did the S&P 500 to 5,815.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq retreated 1.0 percent to 18,315.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Stocks saw a mixed performance at the start of the day, with traders responding mostly positively to earnings reports, but eventually they lost ground.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chipmakers in particular struggled as markets reacted to reports that President Joe Biden's administration was considering a cap on exports of advanced AI chips to some countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dutch tech giant ASML, which supplies chip-making machines to the semiconductor industry, also saw its shares dive in Europe after unveiling a cut to its 2025 guidance and seeing a disappointing slump in sales bookings.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The selloff is because of ASML suggesting that demand is not as strong" as anticipated for chips and AI, said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "ASML mentioned that demand is down from China. That's one of the biggest markets. There's chatter that the US government could start perhaps curbing chip sales even more," Krosby added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among individual companies, ASML shares plunged 16.3 percent in the United States, while chip titan Nvidia lost 4.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   AMD, another major chip company, was down 5.2 percent. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Australia took aim at firms charging consumers for tap or bankcard payments on Tuesday, targeting "hefty" fees in a billion-dollar industry dominated by Visa and Mastercard.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country's centre-left government said it would "ban debit card surcharges" from 2026 and work to lower the cost of other types of electronic payments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australians now use cash for less than 16 percent of transactions, spelling boom times for electronic payment providers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They take a cut of almost every transaction, charging retailers a fee of between one and two percent to run each payment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Australia's central bank estimates merchants paid more than US$4 billion in transaction fees from 2022-2023 alone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many small shops pass along these costs to the consumer. But some larger companies – such as global retail chains – are often able to negotiate substantial discounts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have said it was determined to bring costs down and to stop small vendors from being gouged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumers shouldn't be punished for using cards or digital payments, and at the same time, small businesses shouldn't have to pay hefty fees just to get paid themselves," said economy minister Jim Chalmers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the United States, Visa and Mastercard this year agreed to limit transaction fees and pay US$30 billion to end an anti-trust investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A court has since threatened to reject that deal as overgenerous to Visa and Mastercard. The European Union has longstanding caps on fees.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Credit and debit card companies have previously warned that regulation would mean less competitive markets and only mask the cost for consumers. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Wall Street finished higher on Monday ahead of a slew of high-profile corporate earnings, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 to fresh records.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The S&P 500 closed up 0.8 percent at 5,859.85, while the Dow ended the day up 0.5 at 43,065.22 -- the first time it has closed above 43,000.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 percent to finish the day at 18,502.69, spurred by a 2.4 percent increase in the share price of chipmaker Nvidia, which closed at a new high.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The market "just continues to sort of squeeze higher, led by primarily the mega cap stocks," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You have a market that clearly is continuing to show no signs of breaking here," he added. "And that, I think, is kind of keeping people fearful about missing out on further gains."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Elsewhere on Wall Street, McDonald's and UnitedHealth Group finished up 1.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's exports grew at the slowest pace in five months in September, suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from several trade partners and that global demand for Chinese goods is softening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was "fully confident" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The head of the accounting regulatory body has been appointed chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Kelvin Wong will take up the SFC post from October 24 on a three-year term and will step down as head of the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council (AFRC) on December 31.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wong was a non-executive director of the SFC from 2012 to 2018 and a member of the listing committee of Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited from 2007 to 2013.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Wong has been dedicated to serving the financial services industry, with extensive experience in the operation of the securities and futures markets, capital market development, corporate governance and financial regulatory matters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I expect that under Dr Wong's leadership, the SFC will continue to uphold its dual role as a regulator and facilitator of market development to ensure the fair, transparent and orderly operation of the local securities and futures markets, and to strive for reforms and innovations, with a view to solidifying and enhancing Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre," Chan said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Incumbent SFC chairman Tim Lui will complete his six-year term on October 19.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's consumer inflation rate slowed in September, official data showed on Sunday, while producer price deflation deepened.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The consumer price index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose 0.4 percent year-on-year in September, down from the 0.6 percent increase recorded in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, the producer price index (PPI) fell at the fastest pace in six months, down 2.8 percent year-on-year in September, versus a 1.8 percent decline the previous month
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The slowdown comes as authorities have been seeking to boost domestic activity and shore up China's property sector, with officials on Saturday announcing plans for a significant fiscal stimulus package.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Finance Minister Lan Fo'an told a news conference there will be more "counter-cyclical measures" this year, but officials did not provide details on the size or timing of fiscal stimulus being prepared, which investors hope will ease deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China faces persistent deflationary pressure due to weak domestic demand. The change of fiscal policy stance as indicated by the press conference yesterday (Saturday) would help to deal with such problems," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mainland authorities have stepped up stimulus efforts in recent weeks to spur demand and help meet an around 5 percent economic growth target for this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent weeks, policymakers have unveiled a string of measures in a bid to stimulate activity and spur household consumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank in late September announced the most aggressive monetary support measures since the Covid-19 pandemic, including numerous steps to help pull the property sector out of a severe, multi-year slump, including mortgage rate cuts. (Agencies)
