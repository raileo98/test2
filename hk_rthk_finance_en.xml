 Argentina dismantled key parts of its years-long currency controls and loosened its grip on the peso on Friday as it sealed a US$20 billion, 48-month Extended Fund Facility deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 <br>
  <br>
  The IMF deal lays out an immediate disbursement US$12 billion, and a first review is planned for June with an associated additional disbursement of some US$2 billion, the IMF said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The South American nation's central bank announced that it will undo a fixed currency peg from Monday, letting the peso freely fluctuate within a moving band between 1,000 and 1,400 pesos per dollar, versus 1,074 at the close on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Argentina will eliminate major parts of the so-called "cepo" capital controls that have restricted access to foreign currency, the central bank said in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  Companies from this year will also be able to repatriate profits out of the country, a key demand from businesses that could unlock more investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "As of Monday, we will be able to put an end to the foreign exchange restrictions which were imposed in 2019 and which limit the normal functioning of the economy," Economy Ministry Luis Caputo said at a press conference.  (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished solidly higher on Friday, concluding a rollercoaster week on a positive note amid hopes that the market has absorbed the worst headlines about trade conflicts.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities shrugged off early weakness after China announced 125 percent tariffs on US goods in the latest tit-for-tat move between the two superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite that escalation, traders hope "that we're going to pivot from the phase of escalation to negotiation and hopefully further down the road to de-escalation," said Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones.
  <br>
  <br>
  Potentially "a lot of bad news is in the price already," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished at 5,353.36, up 1.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial average gained 1.6 percent to 40,212.71, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.1 percent to 16,724,46.
  <br>
  <br>
  US equities this week have gyrated as markets digest President Trump's shifting announcements on tariffs and the evolving stance of other parties, including the European Union, which unveiled and then paused countermeasures earlier in the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, economists point to a rising risk of a US recession amid worries about inflation. On Friday, a survey from the University of Michigan noted a sharp drop in consumer confidence, and flagged a worrying rise in both short-term and longer-term inflation expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors are also turning attention to quarterly earnings season, which began in earnest on Friday with large banks and financial players.
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan Chase surged 4.0 percent following better than expected results, while BlackRock gained 2.3 percent and Morgan Stanley rose 1.4 percent. Wells Fargo lost 1.0 percent. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The US dollar tumbled along with most stocks while gold hit a fresh record high as panic gripped markets again on Friday, while China retaliated against Donald Trump's latest tariff blitz against the world's number two economy.
 <br>
  <br>
  Beijing raised the tariffs on US imports to 125 percent near the end of trading in stocks in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 1.13 percent to close at 20,914.69.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.74 percent to end at 7,801.51 while the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 1.8 percent to end at 4,900.43.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US president's decision to delay crippling duties for 90 days sparked a frenzied scramble for equities that had been beaten down since his "Liberation Day" announcement unleashed a global panic.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the realisation that nothing had been resolved, coupled with Trump's decision to double down on his battle with economic superpower China, fuelled another bout of selling of US assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  The greenback tanked against the yen, euro, pound and Swiss franc – investors dropping what is usually considered a key safe haven currency as they look to unload US risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold-standard Treasuries were also under pressure amid speculation that China was offloading some of its vast holdings in retaliation for Trump's measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The weaker dollar and the rush for safety has also sent bullion to a fresh record high above US$3,220.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Beijing's latest tariffs move made in response to Trump, President Xi Jinping urged the European Union to join Beijing in resisting "unilateral bullying" by Washington, state media said as he met Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after, Beijing said it would ramp up levies against the United States to 125 percent, compared with the 145 percent China faces.
  <br>
  <br>
  It added that Washington's moves defied "basic economic laws and common sense" and "seriously violates international trade rules" but said it would "ignore" future US hikes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets across the region were back deep in negative territory at the end of a highly volatile week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo shed 3 percent – a day after surging more than 9 percent – while Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington and Bangkok were also in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Hong Kong and Shanghai rose as traders focused on possible Chinese stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing said earlier in the day that it would implement a moderately loose monetary policy in a bid to reassure investors. (AFP/Xinhua)

<img alt="Paul Chan says the SAR government has formulated various response plans to help fend off financial risks.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong is building a comprehensive financial protection network with systematic response plans and monitoring mechanisms to safeguard what he called the "southern gate" of the nation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The remarks came as trade tensions intensified further between China and the United States, with Washington confirming overnight that levies on Chinese goods now total 145 percent while Chinese duties on American products stand at 84 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  In an interview with the Wen Wei Po newspaper, Chan said the SAR has prepared response plans for different scenarios to ensure that all financial risks will be handled in a timely and effective manner.
  <br>
  <br>
  The SAR government, he added, is in close cooperation with relevant Chinese financial regulatory authorities and ministries, to fully communicate on the response plans and build a "solid barrier" to fend off systemic risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Under current geopolitics, if foreign forces attack Hong Kong from the financial aspect, they can be very powerful, therefore there must be strong support from the country for Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The finance chief stressed the SAR must firmly safeguard financial security at the nation's "southern gate".
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan also said the authorities will take the opportunity of the 10th National Security Education Day next Tuesday to further promote national security and raise awareness, through exhibits and outreach activities in schools and the community at large.
  <br>
  <br>
  He called on financial firms and businesses to take national security into their consideration when making any decisions.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that he noted a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign firms setting up shop here last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The entry of these foreign companies is based on the high recognition of Hong Kong's business environment, further demonstrating the SAR's attractiveness as a financial centre," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong on Friday said the world had entered a new period of uncertainty and disruption because of the US tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Wong, who represents the import and export functional constituency, said diversifying trade links to other regions and countries would be important for local trading firms looking to survive and thrive in this new environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What I've learned in the past few days from a lot of our members, exporters, is basically they just need to diversify or continue to diversify... a lot of Hong Kong exporters have implemented the so-called 'China+N' strategy."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So actually, apart from mainland China manufacturers, they have, for example, another few suppliers in the Asean countries," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong said the new round of US tariffs would accelerate trade trends that had been quietly taking place over the last few years, including reaching out to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I've seen more and more of our members going to Asean, Southeast Asian countries, and they are establishing footholds in the Middle East, like Dubai, and the more adventurous ones are even going to Africa."

 Hong Kong stocks fell on Friday, hurt by growing concerns about the US trade war and the potential for a global recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 124 points, or 0.6 percent, to open at 20,557 points, while the tech sub-index was 0.5 percent weaker.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the blue-chip CSI 300 Index on the mainland and the Shanghai Composite Index were flat, losing just 0.1 percent at the open.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere, Japan’s Nikkei 225 share index was down 5.6 percent in early trading, while shares also fell in South Korea and Australia.
  <br>
  <br>
  Losses of US stocks accelerated after the White House clarified that the United States will tax Chinese imports at 145 percent, not the 125 percent rate that Trump had written about in his posting on Truth Social Wednesday. (Agencies)

 Continuing jitters about US tariffs hit Asian stocks in early trade on Friday, with Japan's Nikkei tumbling more than five percent and gold hitting another record high.
 <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, acknowledged a "cost" to his surging trade offensive against superpower rival China. Levies on Chinese imports are now at a total of 145 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  China has retaliated with levies of 84 percent on US imports
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, the Nikkei 225 was off 5.4 percent, having soared 9.1 percent on Thursday after Trump paused many tariffs for 90 days.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other markets also handed back many of their gains of the previous day, with the Kospi in Seoul off 1.64 percent and Sydney down more than two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil and the US dollar also slid on fears of a global slowdown in economic activity, while gold hit a new record.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fellow safe-haven asset the yen also gained 0.9 percent against the dollar on Friday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump maintained a 10 percent blanket tariff on most countries.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he paused plans for tariffs of 20 percent on the European Union and even higher levies on multiple other trade partners, including 24 percent on Japan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said on Thursday that the EU was "very smart" to back off from imposing retaliatory tariffs because of his tough stance on China even as the bloc's chief warned it could tax US Big Tech.
  <br>
  <br>
  "(The EU) were ready to announce retaliation. And then they heard about what we did with respect to China... and they said, you know, 'We're going to hold back a little bit,'" Trump said.
  <br>
  <br>
  He acknowledged "a transition cost and transition problems," but dismissed global market turmoil.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the end it's going to be a beautiful thing." (AFP)

 Chinese property developer Country Garden said on Friday it had reached an agreement with creditors holding nearly 30 percent of its existing offshore bond debt and was close to finalising terms with another group of bank creditors.
 <br>
  <br>
  The proposed restructuring covers aggregate outstanding principal amount of US$14.07 billion of its existing debt, Country Garden said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The company had proposed the plan to cut its offshore debt by US$11.6 billion in January. Creditors holding 29.9 percent of US$10.3 billion in bonds had agreed to the plan, it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  It was also close to finalising a deal with a lender group made up of seven banks who hold three syndicated loans with an outstanding principal amount of US$3.6 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  The real estate firm has offered five restructuring options to its bondholders including extending the maturity by as much as 11.5 years alongside choosing mandatory convertible bonds and new debt instruments. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks suffered another battering on Thursday, giving back a sizeable portion of the prior session's gains as investors grappled with lingering uncertainty about US President Donald Trump's trade and economic policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  Major US indices spent the entire day in the red, disappointing traders who had been hoping to extend Wednesday's rally following Trump's pivot on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 finished down 3.5 percent at 5,268. The index had soared 9.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.5 percent to 39,593, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 4.3 percent to 16,387.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wednesday's historic rally followed Trump's decision to pause for 90 days many of his most onerous tariffs on trading partners, while doubling down on levies on China.
  <br>
  <br>
  US stocks wiped out trillions of dollars in value in the sessions after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement before the president's reversal on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  But by Thursday, investors realized that Trump's tariff pause "is not enough to get people back in this market," said Peter Tuchman, senior floor trader at TradeMas Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Data showed that US consumer inflation contracted 0.1 percent from a month earlier in a reading that was lower than analyst expectations.
  <br>
  <br>
  But traders have been unnerved by the massive reversals in Trump's policies, resulting in uncertainty that economists warn can paralyse consumers and businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Energy was the biggest loser among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, where 10 groups finished in the red. Only consumer staples mustered a small gain. (AFP)

<img alt="Donald Trump is said to have posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that 'IT'S TIME TO BUY', hours before he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Several American senators have called for an investigation into whether US President Donald Trump engaged in insider trading or market manipulation by encouraging people to buy stocks just before his dramatic reversal on global tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public's expense?" California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff posted on X on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm writing to the White House – the public has a right to know," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee wrote on X that "the President of the United States is literally engaging in the world's biggest market manipulation scheme."
  <br>
  <br>
  The accusations came as Trump posted a few minutes after Wall Street opened that "IT'S TIME TO BUY".
  <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later, he announced a 90-day suspension of additional tariffs against dozens of countries, with the exception of China, triggering a historic stock market rebound.
  <br>
  <br>
  After several days of collapse, the Dow Jones index ended Wednesday up 7.87 percent, its biggest gain since 2008, and the Nasdaq up 12.16 percent, the most since 2001.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump also signed his post on Truth Social with the letters "DJT" – both his initials and the stock market abbreviation for his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The company's shares closed the day up 21.67 percent. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Stocks rocketed on Thursday as a relief rally spread through markets after Donald Trump paused crippling tariffs on US partners, with Chinese investors even brushing off his decision to ramp up duties on Beijing to 125 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended up 2.06 percent at 20,681.78.
  <br>
  <br>
  That marks a third day of gains after it collapsed more than 13 percent on Monday in its worst day since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.76 percent to end at 7,668.38, and the Hang Seng Tech Index climbed 2.66 percent to end at 4,813.74.
  <br>
  <br>
  The across-the-board gains by markets tracked a blistering performance on Wall Street as the US president said he would delay for 90 days measures announced last week that set off a firestorm on trading floors and sparked global recession fears.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump said he would keep in place a basic levy of 10 percent on dozens of countries but upped the ante in his brutal trade war with superpower rival China by hitting it even harder after it retaliated.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's own 84 percent retaliatory measures kicked in on Thursday, later saying that the United States "goes against the whole world" with the measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei surged more than 9 percent, while Taipei's 9.3 percent gain was its best rise on record – after Monday's 9.7 percent drop represented its worst fall.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai gained more than one percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hong Kong and Shanghai markets have been given extra support by optimism that China will unveil fresh stimulus to support its economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul, Singapore, Jakarta, Sydney, Saigon and Bangkok climbed between four and 6.6 percent. Manila and Wellington were also well in the positive territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  In early trade, Paris and Frankfurt cruised more than six percent higher and London rallied more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tech firms were the standout performers, with Sony, Sharp, Panasonic and SoftBank chalking up double-digit gains, while airlines, car makers and casinos also enjoyed strong buying. (AFP/Xinhua)

 Postal Savings Bank of China has announced a commitment to provide no less than 10 trillion yuan in financing to private businesses over the next five years, reinforcing its dedication to supporting the country's private sector amid economic headwinds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The lender said it is expected to earmark at least three trillion yuan specifically for technology innovators and over three trillion yuan targeting agricultural sector development, as part of efforts to help more than 5,000 companies in the private sector enhance their governance capabilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  The major state-owned commercial bank, in partnership with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, recently introduced an action plan aimed at empowering private enterprises, targeting operational growth, technological innovation and digital transformation, among other critical areas.
  <br>
  <br>
  Key programs under the plan include a tailored financing pipeline for private companies, tech R&D support packages, and digital upgrades for small businesses.
  <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2024, the bank's outstanding loans to private enterprises had reached 2.44 trillion yuan – which served over 3.4 million businesses. (Xinhua)

    AI to turbocharge fintech growth in Asia: Paul Chan

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Thursday the integration of artificial intelligence technology into the fintech industry could help turbocharge financial development across Asia.
 <br>
  <br>
  His remarks came as the government-owned investment body, Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), launched a strategic partnership with locally-based virtual bank, WeLab Bank, to further enrich the city's fintech ecosystem.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking at a ceremony marking the partnership, Chan noted that the city's fintech industry, with firms numbering some 1,100, has seen rapid growth over the past year, rising by five places to rank fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index in terms of fintech evaluations.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that it's essential for the industry to incorporate the latest AI technology into its services so as to transform the finance and banking systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For instance, AI technologies can uncover correlations between seemingly unrelated factors, enabling the identification of credit worthiness in individuals who might otherwise be regarded as unqualified for lending," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is exactly what WeLab is achieving for its innovative technologies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I'm confident that through this partnership HKIC and WeLab can assist more local and regional enterprises to leverage AI and fintech, thereby unlocking the potential of finance, to support economic development across Asia."
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to reporters after the event, HKIC chief executive Clara Chan hoped the strategic partnership can help more SAR firms tap into overseas markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  "WeLab has already established a foundation in southeast Asia, their contacts, experience, and ability there can help these companies to accelerate their expansion into the overseas markets there," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Launched in 2019, WeLab Bank said it has been ramping up its adoption of AI in recent years and has integrated DeepSeek's AI models into its local system.
  <br>
  <br>
  The virtual lender has just reported its first monthly profit in December as it speeds up expansion into the southeast Asian market, including Indonesia and Thailand.
  <br>
  <br>
  HKIC, meanwhile, has also struck a strategic partnership deal with chipmaker, StarFive, to speed up the adoption of the popular RISC-V chips, an open-source architecture used to design less-sophisticated semiconductors, in the SAR.

    Lego opens US$1bn factory in Vietnam

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lego has opened a US$1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.
 <br>
  <br>
  The factory, which opened on Wednesday in an industrial area close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.
  <br>
  <br>
  It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colourful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia’s growing markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  “We just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there,” Lego CEO Niels Christiansen said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37 percent by 2032.
  <br>
  <br>
  The privately-held group, which currently makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic, says it has invested more than US$1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.
  <br>
  <br>
  Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The country hopes the plant’s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker and executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Thursday said China was justified in retaliating against US tariffs with trade levies of its own.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on

    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme

  , Lam said the country was only responding to what he said were America's "bullying tactics", but held out hope that a deal could eventually be worked out between Beijing and Washington.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China is always open to a fair talk, you know, sitting at the table, not by just starting something, you know, adding 10 percent, 10 percent, 34 percent and 50 percent, forcing other countries to accept [their terms]...  I think we should all sit down and talk about it."

  While Lam expressed confidence that Hong Kong could weather the storm, he said things could get tough if the uncertainty over trade and tariffs continued, adding he was working with the government to ensure support for local exporters.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I am asking the government to help. I met with HKMA the other day, first of all, I asked them to ask the banks to extend loans, loan repayment periods. So this is first very, very important and essential. And I also [asked] to extend the interest only repayment relief, which is the payment holiday for 12 more months."

 China's consumer prices fell for the second straight month in March, as caution grows over the economic outlook amid mounting tariff risks.
 <br>
  <br>
  The consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent last month from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Thursday. That was slower than February's 0.7 percent decline, but missed the Reuters poll forecast for prices to remain flat.
  <br>
  <br>
  CPI fell 0.4 percent month-on-month, against a 0.2 percent fall in February and missing an estimated 0.3 percent decline.
  <br>
  <br>
  Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, edged up 0.5 percent in March from a year earlier, reversing a 0.1 percent fall in June.
  <br>
  <br>
  The producer price index, meanwhile, declined 2.5 percent in March from a year earlier, deepening the 2.2 percent fall in February, the weakest in four months and below the expected 2.3 percent drop.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beijing unveiled a series of measures to boost the economy last year, including cutting interest rates and cancelling restrictions on the purchase of homes.

  The nation’s economic recovery is also facing headwinds after US President Donald Trump further raised tariffs on China to 125 percent. (Reuters/AFP)

 Stocks surged in Hong Kong on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the harshest tariffs against US trading partners, while Shanghai also advanced even as he ramped up levies on China.

    France cuts growth forecast for 2025 on tariff fears

<div class="itemFullText">
 The French government has cut its growth forecast for 2025 because of the uncertainty over world trade, the economy minister said on Wednesday just hours after US President Donald Trump paused a massive hike in tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  The government had forecast annual growth of 0.9 percent when presenting its 2025 budget, but Economy Minister Eric Lombard told TF1 television that it would be trimmed to 0.7 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Bank of France had already revised its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.7 percent in March, and the French Economic Observatory (OFCE) lowered its forecast to 0.5 percent on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Asked about a possible further downward revision, the minister said that "would depend on the negotiations that will be initiated with the United States and the decisions that are taken on customs duties."
  <br>
  <br>
  "If we succeed in lowering tariffs, we could even get better, and if not, we will see," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lombard ruled out raising taxes in 2025.
  <br>
  <br>
  Just before his interview, Trump announced that he was suspending levies on all countries except China for three months, after US bond and equity markets had tumbled for several days.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's good news, but we must remain calm," Lombard told LCI television, saying he hoped to find "a new agreement" with the Americans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Bank of France governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau welcomed the US move which he called "a return to economic realism and a little reality". But he warned that US policy remained "unpredictable" and that there would be a "negative impact" in Europe.
  <br>
  <br>
  Italy, which exports much more to the US than France, earlier in the day halved its growth forecast for 2025 to 0.6 percent. (AFP)

    Wall Street soars on Trump tariff pause

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks rocketed to close solidly higher on Wednesday, with dramatic advances on all three major indexes as US President Donald Trump delayed steep new tariffs hours after they took effect.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones surged 7.9 percent to 40,608, and the S&P 500 rallied 9.5 percent to 5,456.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Nasdaq jumped 12.2 percent to 17,124.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indexes bounced on Wednesday afternoon as Trump announced a 90-day pause in country-specific tariffs that came into place earlier that day, except levies on Chinese goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  Affected US trading partners, excluding China, would instead face a 10 percent tariff rate, temporarily reverting to a level that took effect over the weekend, though that already roiled markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump singled out the world's second biggest economy, however, saying its tariff rate would be raised to a prohibitive 125 percent "based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the world's markets."
  <br>
  <br>
  "When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around," said Art Hogan of B Riley Wealth Management.
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that investors were waiting for any sense of a more reasonable trade process, saying this situation might "be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings."
  <br>
  <br>
  But he cautioned that "China will become hyper-aware of the fact that they're now being isolated in this process." (AFP)

 Equities tumbled on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war by hitting China with tariffs of more than 100 percent.
 <br>
  <br>
  After a brief respite on Tuesday, investors were once again panicking amid fears Trump's latest moves will spark a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Nikkei closed down nearly four percent, while South Korea's Kospi fell 1.74 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But Hong Kong stocks bucked the downward trend as reports say Beijing is mulling stimulus measures.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index closed up 0.68 percent to close at 20,264.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Reuters news agency has reported that the nation's top leaders plan to meet as soon as Wednesday to hammer out measures to boost the economy and stabilise capital markets. (Agencies)

<img alt="The Hang Seng Index has been volatile amid a tit-for-tat tariffs fight that may escalate even further after Donald Trump's 50 percent levy takes effect on Wednesday. File photo: AFP" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799583_1_20250409143912.jpg&q=60">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 50 percent in extra US duties levied on imports from China on Wednesday have further accelerated deleveraging by investors.
 <br>
  <br>
  That comes as part of a risk-off mode taken by investors following escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, according to financial experts.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, they warned that those investors who saw market downturns as an opportunity and went along with market momentum could find themselves on the short end of the stick as a result of volatilities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Their remarks came as the benchmark Hang Seng Index slumped 1.6 percent to 19,815 at the noon trading break, just as the new tariffs by the United States took effect.
  <br>
  <br>
  The decline marked the index's lowest level since January 23, while the Hang Seng Tech Index fell 1 percent and mainland shares also returned to the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "No matter which market you are talking about, they cannot avoid the three 'T's, which are Trump, trade and tariffs," said Feng Shuyan, an independent portfolio manager, who previously worked with Chubb investment management as associate general manager.
  <br>
  <br>
  She said the latest market trend reflected the rather bearish sentiment among investors, which sped up ongoing deleveraging, and that such a downward trend might continue in the SAR given it is a free port.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre and is more correlated to global stock market performance," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Going forward, it will probably experience lots of volatilities, you will ride roller coasters, as the volatility, the deleveraging, the liquidation process will continue to bite," she told RTHK, adding that institutional investors' reductions on risk assets will further weigh on the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Cash is king, so maybe place a safe bet, " she advised investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, James Wong, chief executive of Almagest Asset Management, said the latest market retreat came amid speculation over the so-called "Mar-a-Lago Accord", a phrase coined last year that refers to efforts to weaken the US dollar and thereby reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Market participants tend to think that the US is going to have this tariff coalition, and the receiving end of that coalition is going to be China, so it's going to be a duel between two giants now," he told RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Right now, I think none of the market participants are eager to get into the market and the short-term fluctuations are hardly indicators that can help us judge what is the general flow of capital and where the market is heading."
  <br>
  <br>
  He suggests investors stay calm and not chase the momentum to avoid a "1929 incident", which saw a market crash on Wall Street that year and led to the largest recession in modern history.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If you're chasing momentum, chances are you are going to be played out by the volatility," he said, noting that other assets such as bonds from Australia could instead be favoured by investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  "What could happen next is going to be very, very messy, in our opinion, and the general direction is that the capital markets is going down for a prolonged period."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A senior official with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday said the SAR would be resilient in the face of ongoing uncertainty from the new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
 <br>
  <br>
  Speaking on
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77" target="_blank">
   <u>
    <b>
     RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme
    </b>
   </u>
  </a>
  , Irina Fan, the HKTDC's director of research, said the city had the experience of dealing with previous disruptions from US trade policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The good thing about Hong Kong is that this is not the first time we have faced higher US tariffs, given relatively low dependence on the US market, we are actually more resilient to the higher tariffs," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fan said local businesses were more prepared this time round, while the city had diversified its trade links substantially since the first Trump administration, with Southeast Asia, as well as the mainland, becoming more important to Hong Kong traders.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have diversified, we have our trade diversions to engage with new markets, for instance, exports to the Asean market expanded by 39 percent and Asean is now already our second largest trading partner after the mainland."
  <br>
  <br>
  "So our trade dependency [on the US] is low and we have diversified our sourcing which makes us more resilient."

 Mainland and Hong Kong shares fell at the open on Wednesday as the US trade war escalated, following Washington's decision to impose 104 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, starting around noon, Hong Kong time.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index sank 3.14 percent, or 632 points, to 19,494, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.13 percent, or 35 points, to 3,110.

  Chinese state holding companies continued to support the stock market by increasing share investment, while a slew of listed firms announced share buybacks.

  Elsewhere in the region, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index initially lost nearly four percent on opening, and markets in South Korea, New Zealand and Australia also declined.
  <br>
  <br>
  South Korea's currency meanwhile fell to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2009, while oil prices slumped three percent in early Asian trade. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks tumbled again on Tuesday as initially successful efforts to rebound from big losses faded amid worries over US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices finished firmly in the red, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.6 percent to 4,982, its first close below 5,000 points in nearly a year.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones ended down 0.8 percent at 37,645, a swing of about 1,780 points below its session peak, while the Nasdaq shed 2.2 percent to 15,267.
  <br>
  <br>
  After three days of losses, Wall Street stocks opened buoyantly as traders embraced talk of White House negotiations with Japan and South Korea in the hopes Trump's trade onslaught might be short-lived.
  <br>
  <br>
  But investors grew edgy as the day progressed with no concrete progress. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed plans for massive tariffs on China to go into effect overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Obviously investors are clamouring for clarity and there still isn't any," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital, who estimated that the market now sees a greater than 50 percent chance of a US recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks have been in free fall since Trump's "Liberation Day" event announcing tariffs on major US trading partners last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials have signalled openness to dealmaking while blasting China for enacting sharp retaliatory tariffs in response to the new US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump plans to impose another 50 percent duty on Chinese goods at midnight, bringing the additional rate on Chinese products to 104 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors in the S&P 500 finished the day in the red, while most of the Dow was also in negative territory.
  <br>
  <br>
  Especially big losers in the blue-chip index included Apple, down five percent and Nike, down 4.2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But UnitedHealth Group surged 5.4 percent after the Trump administration finalised a rule boosting payments to insurers under the government Medicare programme. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European markets battled on Tuesday to recover from the previous day's tariff-fuelled collapse, though Donald Trump's warning of more measures against China and Beijing's vow to "fight to the end" raised concerns of a spiralling trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 299.38 points, or 1.51 percent, higher at 20,127.68, but that was well short of recouping Monday's loss of more than 13 percent, the biggest one-day retreat since 1997.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.31 percent to end at 7,430.62 while the Hang Seng Tech Index jumped 3.79 percent to end at 4,568.38.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index's gains came a day after equities across the world have been hammered since the US president unveiled sweeping levies against friend and foe, upending trading norms, sparking talk of a global recession and wiping trillions of company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors fought to claw back some of those losses as they try to assess the possibility that Washington could temper some of the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo traded up more than six percent – recovering much of Monday's drop – after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held talks with Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, the US leader's threat to hit China with an extra 50 percent tariffs – in response to its 34 percent retaliation in kind – ramped up the chances of a catastrophic stand-off between the two economic superpowers.
  <br>
  <br>
  While uncertainty rules, investors in most markets took the opportunity to pick up some beaten-down stocks.
  <br>
  <br>
  In Tokyo, Nippon Steel closely matched the Nikkei's rebound after Trump launched a review of its proposed takeover of US Steel that was blocked by his predecessor Joe Biden.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai advanced 1.6 percent after China's central bank promised to back major state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment in a bid to maintain "the smooth operation of the capital market".
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney and Mumbai added more than two percent, while Manila gained three percent. Seoul and Wellington also edged up.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt rose more than one percent, having dropped more than four percent on Monday. (AFP/Xinhua)

 Chinese agricultural stocks rose sharply on Tuesday as investors bet tariffs would limit US agricultural imports and boost domestic producers, defying a broader market crash sparked by the escalating Sino-US trade war.
 <br>
  <br>
  Shares of Dabeinong Tech, a seed and animal feed producer, rose 6.45 percent just after noon on Tuesday and shares of Wens Foodstuff, one of the country's largest pig breeders, were up 5.1 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks of other key agricultural firms Wellhope Foods and New Hope Liuhe rose by 6.3 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump's harsher-than-expected import levies, and China's response with tariffs of its own, has prompted a whirlwind of mixed tariff-related headlines that have whipped markets back and forth globally, wiping trillions of dollars in stock market value in just a few sessions.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, Chinese agricultural stocks have advanced this month.
  <br>
  <br>
  A Hang Seng index of agricultural products stocks listed in the mainland is up 8.6 percent in April.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yang Tingwu, vice general manager of asset manager Tongheng Investment, said China's retaliatory tariffs benefit domestic farm products, and the sector is also seen as strategically vital in the escalating trade war.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short term, fewer imported agriculture products is a boon to the domestic farming industry," said Yang, who bought agriculture stocks this week.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the long term, China needs self-sufficiency in grain production in an intensifying rivalry with the US."
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed on Monday, China unveiled a 10-year strategy to boost domestic agriculture and create a more secure food supply by 2035.
  <br>
  <br>
  China retaliated against Trump's tariffs on Friday with extra levies of 34 percent on all US goods, adding to the 10 to 15 percent tariffs it had imposed on US agricultural goods in March.
  <br>
  <br>
  The combined rate threatens to all but end the agricultural trade between the two countries. (Reuters)

    Any Trump bid to weaken greenback 'set to fail'

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Any American attempt to pull off a 1985 Plaza Accord-type coordinated depreciation of the US dollar likely won't work as it would require the consent of China and Europe, Japan's former top currency diplomat Naoyuki Shinohara said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Some analysts believe the Trump administration may push through a "Mar-a-Lago Accord" – a grand bargain to weaken the overvalued dollar – to reduce the huge US trade deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unlike for the Plaza Accord when the United States could work just with close allies Japan and Germany, Washington would need to engage more countries – including the China and European Union – to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market, Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Having antagonised China and Europe with his decision to impose what he describes as reciprocal tariffs, US President Donald Trump will find it extremely difficult to get their consent, Shinohara added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations," Shinohara said in an interview.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That would be quite hard under the current circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big."
  <br>
  <br>
  As Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs from 2007 to 2009, Shinohara negotiated with his US and European counterparts for their cooperation in curbing sharp yen rises that were hurting Japan's export-heavy economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  He was also deeply involved in world-wide efforts among policymakers to deal with the global financial crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In most past shocks, one could identify the cause," Shinohara said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "For the current one driven by Trump, it's hard to tell when and how many times shocks could hit" due to the president's back-and-forth comments on tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That's leaving investors unsure how to respond" and keeping markets volatile, he said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Tokyo's Nikkei index jumped nearly six percent in early trade on Tuesday after plunging 7.8 percent the previous day, as US tariffs fuel market volatility.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 5.81 percent, or 1,809 points, to 32,946, while the broader Topix index gained 6.2 percent, or 141 points, to 2,430.
  <br>
  <br>
  Seoul's Kospi index was also up nearly two percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US President Donald Trump upended the world economy last week with sweeping tariffs that have raised fears of an international recession and triggered criticism even from within his own Republican Party.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, stock markets and oil prices collapsed further, as trading floors across the world endured waves of selling after last week's sharp losses.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump doubled down on his crusade on Monday, saying he was "not looking" at any pause in tariff implementation.
  <br>
  <br>
  But meanwhile "Nvidia's stabilisation and the 2.7 percent rise in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) are expected to trigger buybacks in Japan's high-priced, semiconductor-heavy stocks", brokerage house Monex said in a note.
  <br>
  <br>
  "With the yen's continued weakness providing additional tailwinds, domestic markets are projected to open higher today," it said.
  <br>
  <br>
  One US dollar bought 147.56 yen in morning trade, compared to 147.83 yen overnight.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Both the US administration and President Trump himself are denying reports about the suspension of reciprocal tariffs, meaning concerns over tariffs still persist," Monex said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, meanwhile, said late on Monday that he had a call with Donald Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the US president's latest tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Despite the agreement, "tariff-related volatility will likely continue", Monex added. (AFP)

 China's central bank said on Tuesday it supported sovereign wealth fund Central Huijin Investment increasing its holdings in stock market index funds.
 <br>
  <br>
  The People's Bank of China would provide re-lending support to Central Huijin Investment, a unit of China Investment Corp, when necessary to maintain the smooth operation of the capital market, it added in a statement.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Monday, Huijin stepped in to support domestic stocks that had plunged on US tariff woes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several Chinese state holding companies - China Chengtong Holdings Group and China Reform Holdings Corp - also vowed to increase share investment to foster stability in markets.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's stock benchmark dived 7 percent on Monday amid investor worries about the risk of a damaging trade war and a global recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  Washington last week imposed extra tariffs of 34 percent on China, which then fired back with its own 34 percent levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chengtong said its investment units would increase holdings in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) to safeguard market stability.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are firmly optimistic toward the growth prospects of China's capital markets," the state investment firm said in a statement, vowing to support high-quality growth of Chinese listed companies.
  <br>
  <br>
  China Reform Holdings Corp, also known as Guoxin, said in a separate statement that an investment unit will increase holdings in tech companies, state firms and ETFs, tapping a relending scheme for share buybacks. Initial investment will be 80 billion yuan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said it would never accept the "blackmail nature" of the United States after Washington escalated tariff threats against the nation, the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br>
  The US threats were "a mistake on top of a mistake", a ministry spokesperson said in a statement, urging the US to properly resolve differences with China through dialogue with mutual respect and on an equal footing.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50 percent duty on US imports from China on Wednesday if Beijing did not withdraw the 34 percent tariffs it had slapped on US products last week. Those tariffs had come in response to 34 percent "reciprocal" duties announced by Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  China's retaliatory levies are the firmest response yet to Trump's announcement, which has been met with bewildered condemnation from other leaders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overnight, Liu Pengyu, spokesman for Beijing's embassy in the United States, said China would not cave to pressure or threats.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us. China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," said Liu.
  <br>
  <br>
  He described Trump's threat as a "typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying."
  <br>
  <br>
  Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong cratered on Monday as part of a worldwide stocks rout in response to Trump's tariffs. The Hang Seng Index recorded its biggest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, falling 13.2 percent. (Agencies)

    JPMorgan Chase CEO warns tariffs will slow growth

<img alt="JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1799345_1_20250408084713.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned on Monday that US President Donald Trump's tariffs will likely lift inflation, describing himself as "very cautious" in light of the rising recession risk.
 <br>
  <br>
  "Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth," Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon, an influential figure in markets as the longest serving CEO of a major Wall Street firm, said the US economy had been steady "for years" but was "already weakening" even before Trump's watershed tariff announcement last Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  "There are many uncertainties surrounding the new tariff policy: the potential retaliatory actions, including on services, by other countries, the effect on confidence, the impact on investments and capital flows, the effect on corporate profits and the possible effect on the US dollar," Dimon wrote.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel's back," said Dimon, adding "my most serious concern is how this will affect America's long-term economic alliances."
  <br>
  <br>
  JPMorgan analysts published a note on Friday expecting US GDP to contract this year "under the weight of the tariffs."
  <br>
  <br>
  They also recently raised their risk of global recession to 60 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that if most of Trump's April 9 tariffs take effect, these charges - alongside likely sectoral duties - could tip their forecast to a recession.
  <br>
  <br>
  US and global equities have been in free fall since Trump announced sweeping tariffs last week in a move the president touted as "Liberation Day" from international trade rules he argues have harmed the country.
  <br>
  <br>
  Dimon described Trump's tariffs as one of several factors that could boost inflation, along with continued high fiscal deficits, "the remilitarization of the world" and major investments supporting infrastructure and the green economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  "While inflation has come down, most of what I see in the future is inflationary," said Dimon, who backs the need for reducing the US deficit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These large deficits are not sustainable - I do not know whether it will cause a real problem in six months or six years - the sooner we deal with it, the better," Dimon said. (AFP)

<img alt="The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 both closed less than a percentage lower, while the Nasdaq rose slightly.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks finished mostly lower on Monday following a volatile session amid rising recession worries due to US President Donald Trump's trade wars.
 <br>
  <br>
  Both the Dow and S&P 500 ended lower despite flirting with positive territory, while the Nasdaq mustered a modest gain.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.9 percent at 37,965.60.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent to 5,062.25, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.1 percent to 15,603.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Markets again opened sharply lower following a gloomy round in Asian and European bourses on the weakening global growth outlook after Trump's sweeping tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shortly after the opening, major indices briefly surged into positive territory following a report that White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause.
  <br>
  <br>
  White House officials quickly denied the story, saying that in an interview on Fox News this official was misquoted.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Even though Kevin Hassett was misquoted, market participants could see what would happen if there is a modicum of good news," said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management, who is among market watchers who consider stocks oversold after the recent period.
  <br>
  <br>
  Economists see the tariffs as boosting the risk of recession in light of a possible resurgence in inflation and a slowdown in capital investment from businesses unsettled by shifting US policies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Futures markets have increased bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, with traders overwhelmingly projecting such a move at the central bank's June meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  This week's calendar includes updates on US consumer prices, as well as earnings from JPMorgan Chase and other large US banks. (AFP)

<img alt="All three major US indices were at more than one-year lows in early trading on Monday.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Monday amid worries that a trade war induced by US President Donald Trump's tariffs will spark a global economic slowdown.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major US indices were down more than 3 percent in early trading, reflecting continued angst after Trump's team over the weekend shrugged off the worldwide carnage in markets since his tariff announcement last week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 was down 3.8 percent in early trading, coming off its worst week since Covid; the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,343 points, or 3.5 percent; and the Nasdaq composite was 4.2 percent lower.
  <br>
  <br>
  All three indices were at more than one-year lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump remained defiant on Monday. “Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
  <br>
  <br>
  Then, within the first hour of trading, stocks were swinging up, then down again.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow briefly erased a loss of 1,700 points, shot up more than 800 points, then went back to a loss of 414 points.
  <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 likewise made sudden up-and-down lurching movements and was down 1.3 percent in the first hour of trading. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said the Hong Kong stock market and the local currency remain robust and strong, after the US tariffs triggered the biggest single-day sell-off for the Hang Seng Index on record.
 <br>
  <br>
  The local bourse lost 3,021 points, or 13.2 percent, to close at 19,828.
  <br>
  <br>
  The percentage drop was the worst among major Asian markets on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking to the press after trading ended, Chan said the plunge reflected grim global investor sentiment.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he pointed out that officials didn't see any "systemic market abnormalities" in the SAR, saying the local financial system is very sound and the Hong Kong dollar remains strong.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Basically the market has been functioning orderly. There are substantial selling as well as buying interests. The spread between the two has been very tight, indicating that the buying power remains very strong," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The minister noted that for some time going forward, it's unavoidable that the markets would continue to fluctuate, and investors should exercise caution and assess their risks.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said reciprocal tariffs from different counties against the United States and interest rate movements by central banks could add to market volatility.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants any drastic measures to be taken," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan added that officials will keep a close eye on the markets to guard against financial risks.

    HK stocks slump has retail investors seeing red

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small-time investors in Hong Kong were left reeling on Monday as US President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs and Beijing's retaliation saw the city's stock market suffer its worst day in almost three decades.
 <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell by 13.2 percent – its biggest drop since 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  At a securities brokerage in Central, where more than a dozen elderly investors stared at numbers flashing red on computer screens, the mood was grim.
  <br>
  <br>
  A woman in her nineties, Tam, said she "hated" Trump.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He cost me HK$200,000," she said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "He's nonsensical, he says one thing and changes his mind a few minutes later... How can someone in such a lofty position act like that?"
  <br>
  <br>
  "[Trump] won't let it go, he's making a mess," said another retiree Lee.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Everyone around me is losing money."
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong resumed trading on Monday after a three-day break, which worsened the drawdown, according to Stanley Chik, head of research at Bright Smart Securities.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong's stock market had outperformed the United States since Trump took office, but Monday's rout wiped out HSI gains from the first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Investors have taken a wait-and-see approach for weeks as Trump finalised his trade policies, Chik said, adding that the mood was not yet one of "despair".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong tops the world in retail investor participation, with one 2023 survey showing that 48 percent of the respondents held or traded stocks in the preceding year.
  <br>
  <br>
  A 35-year-old man, Tsang, said his long-term investments lost around US$12,900 on Monday, but he would not consider selling yet.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I didn't expect it to get so bad," said Tsang, a bank employee.
  <br>
  <br>
  China A-shares may be more resilient, he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In this sort of fight (between China and the United States), it's hard to say who will suffer more."
  <br>
  <br>
  Lawyer Ray Chan, 30, was among those left unscathed on Monday, as he sold all his Hong Kong and US shareholdings two weeks ago, netting gains in the seven figures.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We're clearly entering a bear market but I'm prepared," Chan said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "When [Trump] said there would be tariffs on April 2, I could guess where things were headed."
  <br>
  <br>
  It will take "at least a year" before he returns to the market, Chan said. (AFP)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Asian and European equities collapsed on a black Monday for markets after China hammered the United States with its own hefty tariffs, ramping up a trade war many fear could spark a recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trading floors were overcome by a wave of selling as investors fled to the hills, with Hong Kong's loss of 13 percent its worst in nearly three decades, while Taipei dived 9.7 percent, Tokyo almost eight percent and Frankfurt 10 percent in early trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  The benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 3,021.51 points to end 13.22 percent down at 19,828.30.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index tumbled 13.75 percent to end at 7,262.72, and the Hang Seng Tech Index plunged 17.16 percent to 4,401.51.
  <br>
  <br>
  The 13 percent loss for the Hang Seng Index marked its worst day since October 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  On Sunday, vice commerce minister Ling Ji told representatives of US firms its tariffs "firmly protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, including American companies".
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopes that US President Donald Trump would rethink his policy in light of the turmoil were dashed when he said he would not make a deal with other countries unless trade deficits were solved.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something," he said of the ructions that have wiped trillions of dollars off company valuations.
  <br>
  <br>
  The savage selling in Asia was across the board, with no sector unharmed – tech firms, carmakers, banks, casinos and energy firms all felt the pain as investors abandoned riskier assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the biggest losers, Chinese e-commerce titans Alibaba tanked nearly 18 percent and rival JD.com shed 15 percent, while Japanese tech investment giant SoftBank dived more than 11 percent and Sony gave up nine percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Market operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing was also hammered more than 14 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rush to sell saw market turnover hit a record HK$621 billion.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shanghai shed more than seven percent, with China's state-backed fund Central Huijin Investment vowing to help ensure "stable operations" of the market.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore plunged nearly eight percent, while Seoul gave up more than five percent, triggering a so-called sidecar mechanism – for the first time in eight months – that briefly halted some trading.
  <br>
  <br>
  Sydney, Wellington, Manila and Mumbai were also deep in the red.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We could see a recession happen very quickly in the US, and it could last through the year or so, it could be rather lengthy," said Steve Cochrane, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Moody's Analytics.
  <br>
  <br>
  "If there's a recession in the US, of course, China will feel it as well because demand for its goods will be hit even harder," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said spiralling trade tensions had "crushed confidence in markets".
  <br>
  <br>
  "When confidence craters, markets crash and that's what we've seen as a result of the US administration's self-defeating tariffs policy," Chalmers said.
  <br>
  <br>
  European stock markets plummeted at the start of trading on Monday, with Frankfurt slumping up to 10 percent and London and Paris each dropping about six percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amsterdam and Oslo saw losses of more than five percent and Milan down over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  US futures also signaled further weakness.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the S&P 500 lost 3.7 percent while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.9 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future for the Nasdaq lost 4.7 percent. (Agencies)

 Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan said on Monday the government will pay close attention to the stock market and ensure that the city remains financially stable.
 <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong stocks plunged on the first trading session after Beijing hit back over the US imposition of an extra 34 percent tariffs on Chinese goods by announcing reciprocal levies of the same quantum on American goods.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index was down about 9 percent in early trading on Monday, with tech, solar, banking and online retailers' shares plunging.
  <br>
  <br>
  Chan told lawmakers that Hong Kong has a strong financial base that can deal with any volatility in the market and that authorities will stay vigilant to market changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  “Our fundamentals are very strong, liquidity is high, and therefore, we have been fair and open in our operation," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Our core and fundamentals are very strong,” he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  “The government will continue to be vigilant together with the regulators to monitor closely the market to maintain a stable financial market.” (additional reporting by Reuters)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial markets in Hong Kong and across the border dived on Monday as markets around the world crumbled in the face of a widening global trade war and fears it will unleash a deep recession.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng index slumped more than 10 percent in morning trade which, if sustained, would make for the benchmark's largest daily fall since the 2008 global financial crisis.
  <br>
  <br>
  Banking stocks collapsed, with Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered tumbling 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The CSI300 blue-chip index fell more than 5 percent with selling in nearly every sector.
  <br>
  <br>
  The yuan slipped to its lowest since January and bonds rallied sharply.
  <br>
  <br>
  China, which is now facing US tariffs of over 50 percent, responded in kind on Friday by slapping extra levies on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Mainland indexes of solar companies and household appliance makers notched losses around 10 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng volatility index shot to its highest since October.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares of online giants Alibaba and Tencent were down more than 8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's a harsh time when markets go down so dramatically," said Andrew Sullivan, founder of Asian Market Sense, who noted that the latest plunge came as investors race to liquidate some of their shares in the face of a cash crunch following a market meltdown, especially for those who trade using margin financing, or borrowing money from brokers to purchase an investment.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But one should get over the initial panic of wanting to sell, because a lot of the time these markets rebound within days or weeks," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That said, this current situation with tariffs being imposed by Trump, and then retaliatory tariffs by China does indicate that this is a situation that's unlikely to resolve itself anytime soon."
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management, said "the [market sell-off] was beyond my expectation.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is a liquidation sale as people sought to exit [the market]. But the magnitude of the decline was more than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  He expects Beijing to offer stimulus measures in the short term to stabilise the market, such as a cut in the reserve requirement ratio for banks or a tax cut as part of a package of stronger fiscal support.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that the chance of the global economy to enter a recession this year has increased to at least 60 to 70 percent following the tit-for-tat tariff disputes between the world's two largest economies, Wong said a deal between the two sides is needed but difficult to realise.
  <br>
  <br>
  "China knows that if it complies with US demands, this will reinforce Trump's ego and he will ask for more later on, that's why China took a hard stance now. It would be very difficult for both sides to reach a deal.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We probably will be in a bear market for a long time," Wong said.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separately, Sullivan noted that the a key event to follow is whether the US Congress representatives from both parties will stop Trump from implementing the reciprocal tariffs – by revoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergency Act that Trump used to impose the tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Historically, if you saw the VIX index (a barometer for market uncertainty) is above 32, 33  percent, you'd normally get a policy changed by the government."
  <br>
  <br>
  "[But] the VIX index on Friday got above 40 percent, and we've seen no change of Trump turning about or evoking his trade policy. So it's a very difficult position," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if they [Congress members] feel that their own caucuses and electorate are going to turn against them, they will have to make a choice.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Do they stick with Trump who is unlikely to have a third term, or do they stick with their electorate, and support them and go against trump?
  <br>
  <br>
  "That'll be a very interesting thing that we're likely to see in the next couple of weeks."

 Japan's Nikkei share index plunged further on Monday, as US futures pointed to additional losses on Wall Street over President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  In early trade in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 was off 7.35 percent, adding to a 2.75-percent drop on Friday, while in Seoul the Kospi was off 4.8 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australia's stock index plummeted 6 percent at the open on Monday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday that the government would continue to ask President Trump to lower tariffs against Japan, but acknowledged results "won't come overnight."
  <br>
  <br>
  "As such, the government must take all available means" to cushion the economic blow from US tariffs, such as offering funding support for domestic firms and taking measures to protect jobs, Ishiba told parliament.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba said Trump's decision to slap tariffs on imports from Japan was "extremely disappointing and regrettable," adding that Japan would continue to explain that it had done nothing unfair to the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ishiba also said he was willing to visit the United States for a meeting with Trump as soon as possible. "But in doing so, we must ready a package of steps on what Japan could do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's decision to slap a 25 percent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 percent tariff on other Japanese goods, is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's export-heavy economy with analysts predicting the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percent off economic growth. (Agencies)

 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the United States for a month, it said on Saturday, as it considers how to mitigate the cost of President Donald Trump's 25 percent tariff.
 <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, confirmed the temporary export suspension after the Times newspaper reported the plan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Britain's car industry, which employs 200,000 people directly, is highly exposed to the new tariffs. The United States is the second-biggest importer of British-made cars after the European Union, with nearly a 20 percent share, data from industry body SMMT shows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Jaguar Land Rover, one of Britain's biggest producers by volume, said in its statement that the US was an important market for its luxury brands. It sells 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually and exports to the US account for almost a quarter of sales.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US 25 percent tariff on imported cars and light trucks took effect on April 3, the day after Trump announced tariffs on other goods from countries across the globe. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Billionaire US presidential adviser Elon Musk said on Saturday he hoped Europe and the United States would agree to join in a free-trade zone after US leader Donald Trump unleashed heavy global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's sweeping tariffs announced earlier this week sent global stocks tumbling, worried allies, and raised the prospect of others – possibly the European Union – raising tariffs themselves.
  <br>
  <br>
  The EU, which faces a 20 per cent tariff, has already vowed to retaliate in "a calm, carefully phased, unified way", EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope that the United States and Europe can establish a very close partnership," Musk said in a video address to a gathering of the Italian hard-right party La Liga.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America," he added in the video, posted on Musk's social media platform X by La Liga's leader, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
  <br>
  <br>
  The billionaire said he favoured "more freedom for people to move between Europe and North America" for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That has certainly been my advice to the president," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  But he reiterated his condemnation of what he saw as mass immigration. (AFP)

    Tariffs to raise inflation, cool growth: Fed Chair

<img alt="Jerome Powell said on Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1798991_1_20250405044209.jpg&q=80">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump's tariffs risk higher unemployment and will likely cause inflation to rise and growth to slow, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's dramatic trade measures announced earlier this week have tightened scrutiny of Powell and how the Fed will react to free falling financial markets and concerns that a prolonged trade war would ramp up consumer prices and joblessness rates.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth," Powell told an event in Virginia., adding that it was "too soon" to consider changes to US monetary policy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell spoke just minutes after Trump posted on social media, urging him to cut interest rates immediately and accusing him of playing politics in his role running the independent US central bank.
  <br>
  <br>
  The larger-than-expected tariffs unveiled on Wednesday stack on top of earlier country-specific levies, meaning that China, for example, will now face a new levy totalling 54 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Other top trading partners will also see higher rates, with the European Union now facing a 20 percent tariff from April 9, and India looking at a 26 percent levy.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Trump administration has also targeted specific sectors of the economy, recently slapping a 25 percent tariff on automobiles not made in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell said Friday that he expected the current uncertainty to decline in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Powell's comments suggest the Fed is in no rush to cut its benchmark lending rate from its current elevated level of between 4.25 and 4.50 percent, as it continues its struggle to bring inflation down to its long-term two percent target.
  <br>
  <br>
  In recent months, the Fed's progress in bringing inflation down to target has stalled, while growth has remained solid and the unemployment rate has hugged close to historic lows.
  <br>
  <br>
  Faced with this data, the Fed voted last month to extend its pause in rate cuts and signalled that it wanted to see how the new administration's policies would feed through to the economy before taking any action.
  <br>
  <br>
  Fed policymakers - now including Powell - have warned that tariffs could cause prices to rise, with the extent of the price increase likely determined by the rollout of the levies and how consumers and businesses respond.
  <br>
  <br>
  Ahead of Powell's speech on Friday, Donald Trump took to his Truth Social account to insist that his tariff policy would not change despite the market reaction and called on Powell to act.
  <br>
  <br>
  "CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!" wrote Trump, who first nominated Powell to run the Fed, before turning against him during his first term.
  <br>
  <br>
  Speaking Friday, Powell insisted he had no plans to step down as Fed chair before his term ends next year. "I fully intend to serve all of my term," he said during the Virginia event. (AFP)

 Wall Street stocks suffered another bruising sell-off on Friday as major indices slumped more than five percent following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies.
 <br>
  <br>
  US equities spent the entire session in the red, shrugging off solid employment figures and fixating on China's quick retaliation against the US levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  The broad-based S&P 500 led the major indices lower, ending at 5,074.08, down 6.0 percent for the day and more than nine percent for the week.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 5.8 percent to 15,587.79, placing it in a bear market, defined as a 20 percent fall from a recent high.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 5.5 percent to 38,314.86, its first close under 40,000 points since August.
  <br>
  <br>
  The losses increased somewhat following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned of the risk of higher unemployment and higher inflation due to tariff increases he characterized as "significantly larger than expected."
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier, government data showed the US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets focused on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  "We've essentially got an escalating trade war," said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital. "We're at the beginning of a global slowdown if these tariffs remain in place."
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell while the Dow index was overwhelmingly a sea of red, with Apple falling 7.3 percent, Chevron 8.2 percent and Boeing 9.5 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But there were a few equities that rebounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nike and Lululemon Athletica rose three percent or more after Trump spoke optimistically about trade talks with Vietnam, from which both companies import apparel. Clothing importers had been among the most hard-hit sectors on Thursday.
  <br>
  <br>
  Homebuilders were another bright spot in light of falling mortgage rates as markets bet on easing monetary policy. Lennar rose 2.4 percent, while KB Home tacked on 3.5 percent. (AFP)

    Trump extends TikTok deadline to find buyer

<img alt="The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19. File photo: Reuters" src="https://wsrv.nl/?n=-1&we&w=720&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-content.duckduckgo.com%2Fiu%2F%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fi3.wp.com%252Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%252Fimages%252Fmfile_1798987_1_20250405031437.jpg&q=90">
<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump on Friday extended the deadline for TikTok to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the United States, allowing 75 more days to find a solution.
 <br>
  <br>
  "My administration has been working very hard on a deal to save TikTok, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump said on Truth Social, just hours before the deadline was to expire.
  <br>
  <br>
  "A transaction requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."
  <br>
  <br>
  The hugely popular video-sharing app, which has well over 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, or get shut down in the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump has insisted his administration is near a deal to find a buyer for TikTok and keep it from shutting down that would involve multiple investors but has given few details.
  <br>
  <br>
  Motivated by national security fears and belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the hours before that deadline, TikTok was temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the Republican president quickly announced an initial 75-day delay, and TikTok subsequently restored service to users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.
  <br>
  <br>
  The new 75-day delay pushes the deadline to June 19.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president added on Friday that he would "continue working in good faith with China."
  <br>
  <br>
  The president suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to reports, the solution in the works would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
  <br>
  <br>
  Additional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share. ABC News reported on Friday that Walmart was also in the mix.
  <br>
  <br>
  Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm. "TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand – it's simply not as powerful," said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.
  <br>
  <br>
  Amazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Other proposals include an initiative called "The People's Bid for TikTok", launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt's Project Liberty initiative.
  <br>
  <br>
  Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans. (AFP)

<img alt="All three major indices on Wall Street are still heading south.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street stocks opened sharply lower on Friday, shrugging off solid US hiring data and extending a rout after China retaliated in kind to President Donald Trump's global trade tariffs.
 <br>
  <br>
  All three major indices were stuck in the red, pointing to another brutal session after the S&P 500 on Thursday experienced its largest drop since 2020 following Trump's sweeping "Liberation Day" tariff announcement on Wednesday.
  <br>
  <br>
  About 15 minutes into trading, the broad-based S&P 500 was down 3.2 percent at 5,223.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones slumped 2.8 percent to 39,412, while the Nasdaq 3.6 percent to 15,949.
  <br>
  <br>
  The US economy added 228,000 jobs last month, much more than analysts anticipated and significantly above February's revised 117,000 figure, said the Department of Labour.
  <br>
  <br>
  But markets fixated on China's announcement that it was imposing 34 percent tariffs on US imports while also enacting export controls on seven rare earth elements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his plan, saying on his Truth Social platform that "my policies will never change."
  <br>
  <br>
  Friday's trend marks a "continuation of the worry regarding the announcement of the US tariffs on Wednesday, combined with China's quicker-than-expected retaliatory tariffs," said Sam Stovall of CFRA Research.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stovall said investors are ignoring the jobs data, in part because it could lead the Federal Reserve to "continue to remain on the sidelines" following talk that the weakened US outlook with tariffs might prompt the central bank to cut interest rates more quickly.
  <br>
  <br>
  All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 fell, led by energy, with petroleum producers and services companies sliding on a drop in oil prices amid the feeble demand outlook. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wall Street led a global markets bloodbath on Thursday as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's trade war, while the White House insisted the US economy will emerge victorious.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 dropped 4.8 percent in its biggest loss since 2020. The tech-rich Nasdaq plummeted 6.0 percent and the Dow Jones 4.0 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shock waves also tore through markets in Asia and Europe in the wake of Trump's Wednesday announcement, while foreign leaders signaled readiness to negotiate but also threatened counter-tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump slapped 10 percent import duties on all nations and far higher levies on imports from dozens of specific countries, including top trade partners China and the European Union.
  <br>
  <br>
  Separate tariffs of 25 percent on all foreign-made cars also went into effect and Canada swiftly responded with a similar levy on US imports.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Fiat, paused production at some Canadian and Mexican assembly plants.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump dismissed the turmoil, insisting to reporters as he left for a weekend at his Florida golf resorts, that stocks will "boom."
  <br>
  <br>
  The 78-year-old president says he wants to make the United States free from reliance on foreign manufacturers, in a massive economic reshaping that he likened to a medical procedure.
  <br>
  <br>
  "It's what is expected," he said of the market reaction. "The patient was very sick. The economy had a lot of problems."
  <br>
  <br>
  "It went through an operation. It's going to be a booming economy. It's going to be amazing." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Stock markets and the dollar tumbled on Thursday after President Donald Trump's latest tariffs salvo against countries worldwide, fanning a trade war that many fear will spark recession and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  The dollar slumped by as much as 2.6 percent versus the euro, its biggest intraday plunge in a decade, and suffered sharp losses also against the yen and British pound.
  <br>
  <br>
  On stock markets, Wall Street's main indices opened sharply lower, with the Nasdaq falling more than four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The simultaneous decline in both stocks and the US dollar speaks volumes about investor confidence in Trump's trade policy," said City Index and FOREX.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shares in apparel companies, which rely on cheap labour in factories abroad, with Nike sinking 11 percent and Gap shedding 15 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Across the globe, shares in major sectors including auto, luxury and banking also took big hits.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed by more than four percent, and the Paris stock market led losses in Europe as it fell over three percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oil prices plummeted around seven percent to under US$70 per barrel as an economic downturn would hit demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold, a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 an ounce.
  <br>
  <br>
  Yields on government bonds, another haven investment, fell as investors fled risky assets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Equity markets tumbled on Thursday after Donald Trump delivered a "haymaker" blow with sweeping tariffs against US partners and rivals, fanning a global trade war that many fear will spark recessions and ramp up inflation.
 <br>
  <br>
  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index ended the day down 1.52 percent at 22,849.81.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.31 percent to end at 8,420.14, and the Hang Seng Tech Index dropped 2.09 percent to 5,313.26.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo's Nikkei briefly collapsed more than four percent, while US futures plunged with oil prices, safe haven gold hit a record high and the dollar retreated amid worries retaliatory measures will batter economies.
  <br>
  <br>
  Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said: "President Trump walked into the Rose Garden and detonated the most aggressive trade shock the market's seen in decades. This isn't a jab – it's a full-on haymaker."
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street "had talked itself into a softer, more symbolic move.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Instead, Trump carpet-bombed the global supply chain.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This was a 'shock and awe' tariffs campaign, dressed up in 'reciprocity' language but designed to throttle the trade deficit through brute force."
  <br>
  <br>
  Innes said the measures meant inflation risks had surged and economic growth expectations would be cut, with the Federal Reserve "pinned between a hawkish rock and a deflationary hard place".
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo pared its hefty drop but still ended down 2.8 percent, while Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Mumbai, Shanghai and Singapore also fell.
  <br>
  <br>
  However, Wellington managed to eke out a small gain as New Zealand faced smaller tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  London, Paris and Frankfurt all tumbled more than one percent, while Vietnam's stock exchange dived 7.8 percent after the country was hit with levies of almost 50 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wall Street futures were also battered, with the Dow dropping two percent, the Nasdaq plunging more than three percent and the S&P 500 off 2.8 percent off.
  <br>
  <br>
  Safe havens rallied as traders sought to dump risk assets.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gold hit a new peak of US$3,167.84 and the yen strengthened to 147.04 per dollar from 150.50 the day before.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among other currencies, the euro and pound both jumped more than one percent against the dollar on fears about the US economy and bets that the Fed will have to cut interest rates to deal with the impact on growth.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the big corporate losers, Sony shed 4.8 percent, while its South Korean rival Samsung was down 2 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Car titan Toyota was off more than five percent, Nissan lost 3.7 percent and Honda was down 2.3 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tokyo-listed tech investment firm SoftBank was off close to four percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hong Kong-listed e-commerce giants fell after the removal of a duty-free exemption for small parcels from China.
  <br>
  <br>
  Alibaba and JD.com shed 5 and 5.2 percent respectively. (AFP/Xinhua)

 The latest tariffs imposed by the United States will add to the country's own economic pains, complicate already heightened global trade and geopolitical tensions, and result in a backlash from many nations, according to economists.

  They were responding to US President Donald Trump's imposition of steep tariffs on imports from many countries, including 34 percent on China, 20 percent on the European Union, 46 percent on Vietnam and a baseline tariff of 10 percent for a wide range of other nations.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Generally speaking, I do think that the tariffs imposed on all countries are definitely more than people expected, especially in some regions, even in the European Union," Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities, said in an interview with RTHK.
  <br>
  <br>
  He said the higher levies could complicate the already heightened trade tensions between the United States and almost "every single country" in the world, while having a negative effect on global financial markets, which plunged significantly following Trump's announcements.
  <br>
  <br>
  Wong also noted that the across-the-board tariff spikes will add to the pressures on the US Federal Reserve as it tries to reduce interest rates in the short to long term, especially now that the personal consumption expenditures price index – the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – has already shown signs of edging up.
  <br>
  <br>
  For his part, Ben Emons, chief market strategist at  Strategic Fortune Wealth, said that "what we're seeing to be playing out is that the US gross domestic product will contract even further from here [on].
  <br>
  <br>
  "The markets have already been very efficient to drag down the benchmark S&P 500 index by 10 percent from the peak."
  <br>
  <br>
  He added that such declines are only the tip of the iceberg of a broader impact as the tariffs are gradually implemented and, in turn, reflected in hard data in the coming months.
  <br>
  <br>
  Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said that "we have already revised down our growth forecast for the US currently to 1.4 percent for this year, and it's likely going to be revised down further.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is quite incredible because heading into Donald Trump's presidency, the US economy was in a very strong state, but within the time span of just a couple of months, he's managed to potentially undo all of that.
  <br>
  <br>
  "That story of a strong American growth is dissipating and that will carry consequences for the rest of the world given that it's not just China but the entire Asian region that really relies on US demand as a driver of their own economic growth."
  <br>
  <br>
  The latest tariffs are going to sting China as the 34 percent comes on top of an existing 20 percent that, when it comes into effect on April 9, will be closer to Trump’s campaign pledge of a 60 percent rate.
  <br>
  <br>
  Also among Trump's moves was an order to end duty exemptions on low-value shipments from China under the "de minimis" rule starting on May 2, which analysts said brings the trade war "closer to home", as many middle-income American households rely on the exemptions as part of daily e-commerce purchases.
  <br>
  <br>
  Noting that China was always bearing the brunt of America's trade policies, Marro said that Beijing this time must act more pro-actively in its response to such trade shocks, such as by boosting domestic consumption to offset the trade impact.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Chinese officials need to act pro-actively respond to these shocks, not just in terms of cushioning exporters and producers, but also over what this means for reviving domestic consumption, ensuring that they can reflate the economy in ways that are sustained," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "Domestic demand is really going to be one of the only ways for China to offset this external demand shock," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Singapore-based investment veteran Olivier d'Assier noted that Trump's tariffs will draw a backlash from many nations, as the level of increase far exceeds expectations and may not serve as the negotiation tool that the American president may have been hoping for.
  <br>
  <br>
  "[So] if you say 10 percent or 15 percent, it gets people's attention," said d'Assier.
  <br>
  <br>
  "They [the nations] come to the table, they negotiate some kind of deals.
  <br>
  <br>
  "But if you say 30 percent, 40 percent, 54 percent, this would be unacceptable to most of these trading partners, and they will retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And they have means to retaliate.
  <br>
  <br>
  "I don't think Trump realizes this, but there are options for people [nations] to stay and wait.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And I think that's the reaction he's going to get on these trade tariffs from China, from the EU, from Canada, and others."
  <br>
  <br>
  D'Assier added that [the nations] will say, 'well, since your economy is the one that's going to take the pain initially, we'll just wait and see how long you can take it'".

 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described US President Donald Trump's universal tariffs as a major blow to the world economy and said that the European Union was prepared to respond with countermeasures if negotiations failed.
 <br>
  <br>
  "We are already finalising the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel," she said in a statement read out in Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, on Thursday ahead of an EU-Central Asia partnership summit.
  <br>
  <br>
  "And we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail."
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump earlier unveiled a 10 percent minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States – with a higher 20 percent rate for the European Union – kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall US and global economic growth. (Reuters)

 Hong Kong stocks sank more than two percent in opening trades on Thursday after US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against trade partners, including 34 percent on imports from China.
 <br>
  <br>
  The Hang Seng Index dropped 2.43 percent, or 564 points, to 22,638, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.91 percent, or 30 points, to 3,319.
  <br>
  <br>
  Financial markets have been jolted by President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcements, with US stock futures down by as much as three percent early on Thursday and Tokyo’s market leading losses in Asia.

  <br>
  Oil prices sank more than US$2 a barrel and the price of bitcoin dropped 4.4 percent.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the price of gold hit a new record, crossing its previous record at around Wednesday 2300 GMT and then continuing to climb above US$3,150 an ounce, as traders piled into the safe haven asset. (Agencies)

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that closes a trade exemption known as "de minimis" that has allowed low-value packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to enter the United States, free of duties.
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump signed the order, which takes effect on May 2, in the Rose Garden of the White House after announcing sweeping new tariffs on global trading partners.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the move came after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick certified "adequate systems are in place to collect tariff revenue" on the shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  It said imported goods from mainland China and Hong Kong sent outside the international postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to all applicable duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  Imported goods sent through the postal network and valued at or under US$800 would now be subject to a duty rate of either 30 percent of their value or US$25 per item, with that rate increasing to US$50 per item after June 1.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump had signed an initial order on February 1 ending duty-free entry for the cheap Chinese goods, but later paused the order because of logistical issues complicating the inspection of millions of the low-value shipments.
  <br>
  <br>
  The number of shipments entering the US through the duty-free route has exploded in recent years, reaching nearly 1.4 billion packages last year.
  <br>
  <br>
  More than 90 percent of all packages coming into the US now enter via de minimis, and of those, about 60 percent come from China, led by direct-to-consumer retailers such as Temu and Shein.
  <br>
  <br>
  Trump's order affecting de minimis parcels was paused on February 7 because there had not been sufficient time to prepare, with packages stacking up at ports of entry.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said carriers transporting the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong postal items must "report shipment details to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), maintain an international carrier bond to ensure duty payment, and remit duties to CBP on a set schedule."
  <br>
  <br>
  It said CBP may require formal entry for any postal package instead of the specified duties.
  <br>
  <br>
  The White House said the commerce secretary would submit a report within 90 days assessing the order’s impact and considering whether to extend these rules to packages from Macau. (Reuters)

    'Tariffs will change global trading system'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday vowed to "fight" against US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he warned will "fundamentally change the global trading system."
 <br>
  <br>
  Trump's unveiling of 10 percent tariffs on imports from around the world and harsh additional levies on key trading partners ignited global anger, but for Canada the impact of the latest announcement was limited.
  <br>
  <br>
  Previously announced US levies on Canadian steel and aluminium remain in place. Canada may also be hit hard by Trump's auto sector tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  But America's northern neighbour and largest trading partner was not singled out for additional tariffs, and Canadian goods compliant with an existing North American free trade agreement appear exempt from new levies for now.
  <br>
  <br>
  Carney noted that Trump's latest announcement "preserved a number of important elements of our relationship, the commercial relationship between Canada and the United States."
  <br>
  <br>
  The prime minister, who replaced Justin Trudeau last month, said Trump's trade war will "negatively" impact the US economy and will "directly affect millions of Canadians."
  <br>
  <br>
  "We are going to fight these tariffs with counter measures. We are going to protect our workers," Carney said in Ottawa.
  <br>
  <br>
  "In a crisis it is important to come together and it is essential to act with purpose and with force and that is what we will do," he added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Last week in a call with Trump, the pair agreed to discuss the future of bilateral trade after the election.
  <br>
  <br>
  Polls currently project Carney's Liberal Party will win a majority. (AFP)

    US trade tariff 'not act of a friend': Albanese

 Donald Trump's trade tariffs on close ally Australia are "not the act of a friend" and will hurt the two nations' relationship, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br>
  Australia will however not retaliate against the announced 10-percent tariff with its own trade duties, the prime minister said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This is not the act of a friend," Albanese told a news conference after Trump's tariff announcement, saying one in four Australian jobs depended on trade.
  <br>
  <br>
  The centre-left Australian leader, who faces a tightly contested general election on May 3, said Australia charged nothing on US imports and should face zero US tariffs.
  <br>
  <br>
  "These tariffs are not unexpected, but let me be clear, they are totally unwarranted," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  The United States has been Australia's strongest military ally since World War II, and the two countries have joined with Britain in a deal to provide Australia's navy with stealthy nuclear-powered submarines.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the new measures could change how people see their relationship, Albanese said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "The Australian people have every right to view this action by the Trump administration as undermining our free and fair trading relationship and counter to the shared values that have always been at the heart of our two nations long-standing friendship," he said.
  <br>
  <br>
  "This will have consequences for how Australians see this relationship," the Australian leader added.
  <br>
  <br>
  Australian blue-chip stocks dipped nearly two percent in early trade as one of the first global markets reacted to Trump's trade action. (AFP)

<img alt="More volatility is expected, with US futures moving decisively lower late Wednesday after Trump announced his tariffs plan.

<br>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US stocks whipped through another dizzying day on Wednesday in the final hours before President Donald Trump’s unveiling of tariffs promised as part of his Liberation Day.
 <br>
  <br>
  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 5,670, but only after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1 percent and a later gain of 1.1 percent. It’s had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 235 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 42,225, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 percent to close at 17,601. Both also veered from sharply lower in the morning to sharply higher in the afternoon before doubling back.
  <br>
  <br>
  Elon Musk’s Tesla helped knock the market around after initially falling more than 6 percent following a report that it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last year’s first quarter.
  <br>
  <br>
  Tesla is one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of its immense size, and it’s faced backlash due to anger about CEO Elon Musk’s leading the US government’s efforts to cut spending. But its stock erased its loss from the morning and ended with a gain of 5.3 percent following a report from Politico that Trump has told others that Musk will step back from his government role in coming weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  After the market closed, Trump declared a 10 percent baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.
  <br>
  <br>
  The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 percent tax on imports from China, a 20 percent tax on imports from the European Union, 25 percent on South Korea, 24 percent on Japan and 32 percent on Taiwan.
  <br>
  <br>
  Among the companies whose shares fell in after-hours trading were Deckers Outdoor, the maker of Uggs, down 9.3 percent; Lululemon was down 8.8 percent; and home products retailer Williams-Sonoma was down 8.4 percent. (AP)

 US stocks finished mixed on Tuesday on a quiet trading day as investors braced for Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which he has dubbed "Liberation Day".
 <br>
  <br>
  The US president has not unveiled the details of his plan, leaving traders guessing ahead of the announcement, which the White House has now penned for Wednesday at 4pm local time in Washington (2000 GMT), after Wall Street markets close.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped less than 0.1 percent to 41,989, while the broad-based S&P 500 shook off a recent slump to close up 0.4 percent at 5,633.
  <br>
  <br>
  The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also finished in the green, gaining 0.9 percent to 17,449, a day after posting its worst quarter since 2022.
  <br>
  <br>
  All the nervousness in the market helped push the price of gold to records, and it briefly topped US$3,175 per ounce - that’s up from less than US$2,700 at the start of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  In stocks, Tesla charged 3.6 percent higher a day ahead of reporting how many vehicles it delivered during the first three months of the year.
  <br>
  <br>
  On the losing end of Wall Street was Johnson & Johnson, which dropped 7.6 percent after a US bankruptcy court judge denied the company’s settlement plan related to baby powder containing talc. It’s the third time the company’s attempt to resolve the baby powder settlement through bankruptcy has been rejected by courts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Lululemon Athletica led the market lower with a drop of 14.2 percent, even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
  <br>
  <br>
  Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 5.7 percent. (Agencies)
