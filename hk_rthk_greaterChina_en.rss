<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will attend a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on May 26-27 in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It'll be the first such meeting in more than four years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the South Korean presidential office, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will have bilateral talks with Li and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday ahead of their three-way gathering a day later.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three countries are expected to adopt a joint statement on six areas, including on the economy and trade, following the summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said China stands ready to work with Japan and South Korea to implement the trilateral cooperation vision for the next decade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This summit will be a turning point for Korea, Japan and China to completely restore and normalise three-way cooperation systems,” Kim Tae-hyo, South Korea's deputy national security director, told a news conference in Seoul.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The summit was last held in December 2019 in China before it was suspended because of the pandemic. (Agencies)

 One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.

 Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.

 The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.

 The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

 The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.

 The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.

 Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China has been involved in efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia. (Agencies)

 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

    US raises tariffs on Chinese imports

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing has hailed its "no limits" partnership as it enjoys access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. (Xinhua/Agencies)

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan wave as they arrive at Belgrade Airport, the second stop of Xi's European tour. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752886_1_20240513054450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)

 The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday said the China-Hungary relationship is now at its best in history.

 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.

 Figures from the General Administration of Customs show that exports grew 1.5 percent from April last year, in line with analysts' expectations, after contracting sharply to 7.5 percent in March.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday evening, state media said, in the last leg of his European tour after visiting France and Serbia earlier this week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Broadcaster CCTV said Xi "arrived in Budapest by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban".

 <br/>
 In a written speech upon his arrival, Xi said China and Hungary are good friends and good partners.

 <br/>
 "I am delighted to pay a state visit to the beautiful country of Hungary at the gracious invitation of President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban," he said, extending heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the Hungarian government and people on behalf of the government and people of China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In recent years, the two sides have seen frequent high-level exchanges, and fruitful outcomes in Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation," he added. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Beijing slams US chip export licence withdrawals

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

 French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday thanked President Xi Jinping for backing his idea of a truce in all conflicts including Ukraine during the Paris Olympics this summer.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I thank you for showing your desire during our talks to ask all parties to have an Olympic truce," Macron said at a joint press conference, adding that such a truce for "all theatres" of war could help achieve lasting peace in the conflicts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Ukraine, President Xi said China supports the convening of an international peace conference on the crisis at an appropriate time. He said the conference should be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans.

 President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China saw a 35 percent jump in the number of arrivals and departures during the May Day holiday from a year ago.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sino-French relations over the past 60 years have been at the forefront of China's ties with major Western countries, setting a good example for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, President Xi Jinping said on Sunday as he arrived in France for a state visit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, met Xi at the airport at the start of his first visit to a European Union country in five years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a written speech, Xinhua reported that Xi also described Sino-French relations as a model of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua quoted the president as saying the development of China-France ties brings benefits to the two peoples and injected stability, positive energy into a turbulent world.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xi also said China was ready to consolidate traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields with France through the visit.
 <br/>
 <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Long March-5 rocket, carrying the Chang'e-6 spacecraft, blasted off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan on Friday afternoon.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Collecting and returning samples from the far side of the moon is an unprecedented feat. Now we know very little about the moon's far side. If the Chang'e-6 mission can achieve its goal, it will provide scientists with the first direct evidence to understand the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon, which is of great significance," said Wu Weiren, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of China's lunar exploration program.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chang'e-6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e-5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours after landing, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. Scientific detection work will be carried out simultaneously.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, the China National Space Administration said. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a highway collapse in Guangdong province increased to 48 on Thursday, as President Xi Jinping called for the utmost efforts to save lives and eliminate dangers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Heavy rains caused a stretch of road running from Meizhou city towards Dabu county to cave in at around 2.10am on Wednesday, according to Xinhua news agency.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Vehicles careened into the nearly 18-metre-long gash in the tarmac and plummeted down the steep slope below. The highway collapse had trapped over 20 vehicles, according to Xinhua.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State media called the road collapse a "natural geological disaster" caused by the "impact of persistent heavy rain".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 500 people have been dispatched to help with the rescue operation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua reported that Xi is highly concerned about the incident and gave important instructions on the rescue and relief work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The president said efforts should be made to repair the damaged roads and restore traffic order as soon as possible, and that all regions and relevant departments must strengthen monitoring and early warning, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property as well as overall social stability.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last month, massive downpours in a different part of the province sparked floods that claimed four lives and forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And a tornado killed five people when it ripped through Guangzhou last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 With rainfall expected to intensify throughout May, the government has warned of possible further disasters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Multiparty discussions and evaluations indicate that strong convection and heavy precipitation may increase in China in May," Xinhua cited the emergency management ministry as saying. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 At least 24 people died after part of a highway collapsed due to heavy rains in Guangdong province on Wednesday, state media said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xinhua news agency said that a stretch of road between Meizhou city and Dabu county caved in at around 2.10am. The incident caused 20 vehicles to become trapped and involved a total of 54 people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As of 3pm, "24 people have been confirmed dead, and 30 are receiving all-out emergency care in hospital", Xinhua said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The news agency also said the incident did not involve any large vehicles or vehicles transporting hazardous chemicals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An aerial photograph published by broadcaster CCTV showed wrecked vehicles lying in a deep muddy pit where the highway once ran, while dozens of emergency vehicles and cranes congregated along the intact section of the road, which bisects a steep, wooded slope. It reported that a nearly 18-metre stretch of road had fallen away.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Authorities have dispatched around 500 people to the site to help with the rescue operation. They are drawn from departments handling public security, emergency response, firefighting and mining rescue.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incident is the latest in a string of disasters attributed to extreme weather events in Guangdong in recent weeks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Massive downpours last month sparked floods in a different part of the province that claimed the lives of four people and forced the evacuation of over 100,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on Wednesday conducted maiden sea trials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Fujian, the most advanced aircraft carrier yet, left Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard at about 8am to conduct trials to test the reliability and stability of its propulsion and electrical systems.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 First shown to the public in June 2022, the Fujian was entirely designed and built domestically.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The aircraft carrier is larger and technologically more advanced than the Shandong, commissioned in 2019, and the Liaoning, which China bought second-hand from Ukraine and refitted domestically.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since its launch in June 2022, the Fujian has completed its mooring trials, outfitting work and equipment adjustments. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency has declared the Shenzhou-17 mission a complete success as its three crew members returned to Earth on Tuesday afternoon after their six-month mission in space.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The agency said astronauts Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin were in good health conditions as they emerged from the spacecraft's return capsule that touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang Hongbo, commander of the Shenzhou-17 mission and the first to step out of the capsule, thanked everyone for their support.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I feel so proud of my country," he said. "Every time the spacecraft flew over the motherland, I always searched for my homeland with a sense of longing and pride."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang Shengjie described it as a dream come true, and said he can't wait for the next mission.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "For me, the six-month mission is a learning journey for me, and also a journey for exploration. I learned a lot; there is a vast universe and there's no end for me to continue to explore."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Earlier on Tuesday, the Shenzhou-17 separated from the country's space station combination and started its journey back to Earth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Before the separation, the Shenzhou-17 crew – with the assistance of the ground staff – completed various tasks such as setting the status of the space station combination and carried out handover work with the Shenzhou-18 crew.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang Hongbo has now accumulated a total of 279 days in space over the course of two missions, Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17, setting a new record for the longest spaceflight by a Chinese astronaut.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Shenzhou-17 crew were launched to the Tiangong space station last October. The Shenzhou-18 was launched last week. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The third plenum of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will be held in Beijing in July.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 That's in accordance with a decision made at a Politburo meeting on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to Xinhua News Agency, the upcoming plenary session "will primarily study issues concerning further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 President Xi Jinping, who's also party general secretary, presided over the Politburo meeting, which also analysed the current economic situation and economic work, and discussed continuous efforts to advance the high-quality integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the meeting, "China's reform must continue in the face of complex international and domestic situations, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial changes, and the new anticipation of the people," Xinhua reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The meeting said despite an economic rebound, challenges remained such as inadequate demand, operating pressure on enterprises and the risks facing key areas.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It also stressed the need to respond to people's aspirations for quality homes and tackle a housing stockpile.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing has set a 2024 growth target of around 5 percent for the world's second-largest economy. (Agencies)

    China factory activity slows in April

File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751150_1_20240430103806.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Monday announced that President Xi Jinping will pay state visits to France, Serbia and Hungary from May 5-10.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the French government, Xi is due to make a state visit to France on May 6-7.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Bilateral relations with Paris have maintained sound growth momentum, and both countries have had strategic communications and practical cooperation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said in discussing the president's trip to France.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "China looks forward to working with France to further enhance political mutual trust, solidarity and cooperation," Lin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This will be Xi's first European tour since the pandemic.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This visit takes place on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries and follows on from the president's visit to Beijing and Guangzhou in April 2023," French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.

 "Exchanges will focus on international crises, first and foremost the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, trade issues, scientific, cultural and sporting cooperation," the Elysee office said. (Agencies)

 A mainland-based political commentator says relations between China and the United States have improved, but both countries need to work together to resolve conflicts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, was commenting after President Xi Jinping said China and the US should be partners, not rivals, during his meeting with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Well, I mean it's better than it was last year at this time. There's at least communication going on. There's more planned communication. It's very important, you have to keep talking especially when you have global tensions like this. There are so many issues that need to be tackled," he said, while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tangen said that, although the Biden administration would most likely continue to see China as a threat, this wasn't the case for business.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Business interests are very interested in cooperating and this is a kind of a medium term situation," he said. "You have Elon Musk coming to China."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Sunday Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, where he was expected to discuss the roll-out of Full Self-Driving software and permission to transfer data overseas, the Reuters news agency reported.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 State media said Musk had met Premier Li Qiang, who said Tesla's development in China could be regarded as a successful example of US-China economic and trade cooperation.

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)
