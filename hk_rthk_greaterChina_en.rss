<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced that China would host the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026, adding it would be another milestone in Beijing's relations with the Middle East region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the announcement as he delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi also called for a peace conference on the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as he addressed Arab leaders and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is this week hosting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and several other Arab leaders for a forum at which discussions on the war in Gaza were expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the delegations, Xi said China supported a "broad-based" peace conference to resolve the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Middle East is a land bestowed with broad prospects for development, but the war is still raging on it," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "War should not continue indefinitely. Justice should not be absent forever," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China supports Palestine's full membership of the United Nations.(Xinhua/AFP)

    Two giant pandas to head to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 2022. Two other giant pandas are heading to Washington's National Zoo later in the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will return giant pandas to Washington's National Zoo by the end of the year, US First Lady Jill Biden and officials said on Wednesday in a surprise announcement signalling a new era of panda diplomacy between the two superpowers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We are excited for children near and far to once again enjoy the giant pandas' adorable and joyful adventures at our @NationalZoo," the first lady posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing will send a new pair called Bao Li and Qing Bao under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a statement, hailing a "historic moment" that demonstrated the benefits of its partnership with Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, DC," said Brandie Smith of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, only a handful of the iconic black and white bears remain in the US, with three having left the national zoo in Washington six months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Xi Jinping said after meeting President Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to the United States as a gift, following then-president Richard Nixon's historic visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strained relations between the rival superpowers in recent years have led Beijing to call some of the pandas back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington – Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who arrived in 2000, and their three-year-old cub Xiao Qi Ji ("Little Miracle" in English) – flew back on a cargo plane to China in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The currently last remaining pandas in the US, at a zoo in the southern city of Atlanta, are due to return to China later this year, although China announced plans in February to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Egypt on Wednesday signed agreements deepening their cooperation during President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping and his Egyptian counterpart witnessed the signing in a ceremony that coincided with the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Egypt discussed bilateral relations and bringing stability to the Middle East in light of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a statement released by the Egyptian presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused a large number of innocent Palestinian civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely severe. China is deeply pained," Xi told el-Sisi, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top priority task now is an immediate ceasefire, in order to avoid spillover of conflict, impact on regional peace and stability, and so as to prevent a more serious humanitarian crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China is ready to work with Egypt to continue to assist the people of Gaza "and push for an early, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, have been engaged for months in talks aimed at securing a lasting truce between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreements signed between Beijing and Cairo on Wednesday include collaboration in the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state projects, including the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital east of Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investments between the two countries amounted to around US$14 billion in 2023, compared to US$16.6 billion in 2022, according to the latest data released by Egypt’s statistics agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment, and to further boost employment through development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a Politburo group study session, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We should] insist that employment of young people including college graduates is a top priority," Xi told the session. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilise the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for efforts to deepen the reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China created 4.36 million new urban jobs in the first four months, human resources ministry data showed, 36 percent of its annual job creation target. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    Douyin to tighten regulations for viral posts

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Douyin says it guides creators to record "true, good lives". File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755047_1_20240528163706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese social media giant Douyin has said it will start cracking down on posts that use so-called "hot events" to boost views, after state media reported that accounts for multiple influencers known for showing off their lavish lifestyles had been blocked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Douyin said these videos use scenarios, such as staged medical crises or domestic disputes, in a bid to go viral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Douyin guides creators to record true, good lives," the company added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after Global Times newspaper earlier this month said the Douyin account belonging to content creator Wang Hongquan – which had more than 4.3 million followers – was no longer accessible last week amid a crackdown on influencers who flaunt their wealth online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang's Douyin page had featured videos where he showed off designer outfits, first-class flights and his jade jewellery collection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A screenshot of his Douyin profile page showed that the account had been banned for violating the platform's regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese social media platforms, including Tencent, Kuaishou, Weibo and Little Red Book, had jointly issued a statement on May 15 saying they will crack down on those showing off their wealth, according to Global Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douyin said they removed over 4,701 pieces of inappropriate content and closed 11 accounts from May 1 to 7, while Little Red Book cleaned up more than 4,200 posts and shut 383 accounts in two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, "Sister Abalone", a woman who filmed her elaborately decorated mansion and was regularly seen dripping with diamond and pearl necklaces, also appeared to have been targeted, with her videos on the YouTube-like Bilibili site no longer visible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And "Young Master Bo", an influencer who filmed himself test-driving Rolls-Royces and splurging on rare Hermes Birkin bags, was also missing from Douyin, with his account showing an error message that said he had "violated relevant laws and regulations". (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Shanghai have unveiled a set of measures to provide further targeted support for homebuyers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine measures unveiled on Monday aim to meet the diversified living needs of residents, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include easing home-purchase restrictions further for non-Shanghai residents and divorced couples, and allowing families with two or more children to purchase an additional home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement followed similar moves in major cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities had imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and speculation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A political academic in Shanghai has described trilateral talks between China, Japan and South Korea as a step in the right direction, although he said the security stances of Tokyo and Seoul may be problematic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Josef Gregory Mahoney from East China Normal University said Japan and South Korea had recently been gravitating towards the Aukus defence pact - between the US, Australia and the UK - and it remained to be seen how things would play out after the US presidential election later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main issues of whether Japan and South Korea will continue to draw closer to the US, as we've seen, especially since President Yoon took office in Seoul and whether or not we'll see a change in the US presidency this November and how that would affect US strategic positioning where we've seen, of course, Biden playing a very powerful role in advancing the Indo-Pacific concept and moving forward with Aukus," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And, of course, we've had recent reports that South Korea and Japan will be cooperating with Aukus, which most people interpret as a new sort of Pacific-based Nato that is the foremost part of American containment strategies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-day talks in Seoul, which began on Sunday, were the first direct dialogue between the three countries in more than four years with Premier Li Qiang meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Mahoney also said he did not think a free trade pact would emerge soon, despite the countries agreeing to work towards one.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will attend a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on May 26-27 in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It'll be the first such meeting in more than four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the South Korean presidential office, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will have bilateral talks with Li and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Sunday ahead of their three-way gathering a day later.

 One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further investigation into the cause of the explosion is underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command on Thursday started joint military drills surrounding Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)

 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari added that Iran attaches great importance to its relationship with China, and is committed to enhancing cooperation in political, economic, cultural and other fields. (Reuters/Xinhua)

 The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)

 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin attend a tea ceremony in Beijing. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753529_2_20240517122205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."

 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

    US raises tariffs on Chinese imports

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”

  Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the one-China policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the common interests of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan wave as they arrive at Belgrade Airport, the second stop of Xi's European tour. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752886_1_20240513054450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)

 China's exports and imports grew in April as domestic and global demand picked up, giving a boost to the world's second-biggest economy.

  Imports in April surged 8.4 percent – nearly double market estimates – after falling by 1.9 percent in the previous month.

 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday evening, state media said, in the last leg of his European tour after visiting France and Serbia earlier this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Broadcaster CCTV said Xi "arrived in Budapest by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech upon his arrival, Xi said China and Hungary are good friends and good partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am delighted to pay a state visit to the beautiful country of Hungary at the gracious invitation of President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban," he said, extending heartfelt greetings and best wishes to the Hungarian government and people on behalf of the government and people of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent years, the two sides have seen frequent high-level exchanges, and fruitful outcomes in Belt and Road cooperation, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Together, we have set a fine example of building a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation," he added. (Xinhua/AFP)

    Beijing slams US chip export licence withdrawals

    <![CDATA[<img alt='The US Commerce Department says it has revoked "certain licenses for exports to Huawei" but did not specify which ones it had withdrawn. File photo: Reuters' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752361_1_20240508221032.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

  <br/>
  "A knife attack occurred at the Chengnan Hospital in Zhenxiong County, which resulted in two deaths and 21 injuries," a statement on the county's official WeChat account said.

 French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday thanked President Xi Jinping for backing his idea of a truce in all conflicts including Ukraine during the Paris Olympics this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I thank you for showing your desire during our talks to ask all parties to have an Olympic truce," Macron said at a joint press conference, adding that such a truce for "all theatres" of war could help achieve lasting peace in the conflicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, President Xi said China supports the convening of an international peace conference on the crisis at an appropriate time. He said the conference should be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi arrived in Paris on Sunday for a two-day visit.

  Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China saw a 35 percent jump in the number of arrivals and departures during the May Day holiday from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

 Sino-French relations over the past 60 years have been at the forefront of China's ties with major Western countries, setting a good example for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, President Xi Jinping said on Sunday as he arrived in France for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, met Xi at the airport at the start of his first visit to a European Union country in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech, Xinhua reported that Xi also described Sino-French relations as a model of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted the president as saying the development of China-France ties brings benefits to the two peoples and injected stability, positive energy into a turbulent world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China was ready to consolidate traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields with France through the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi is expected to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen on his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his European visit, Xi will also visit Hungary and Serbia.

    Chang'e-6 blasts off to far side of the moon

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Long March-5 rocket, carrying the Chang'e-6 spacecraft, blasted off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Collecting and returning samples from the far side of the moon is an unprecedented feat. Now we know very little about the moon's far side. If the Chang'e-6 mission can achieve its goal, it will provide scientists with the first direct evidence to understand the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon, which is of great significance," said Wu Weiren, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of China's lunar exploration program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e-5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours after landing, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. Scientific detection work will be carried out simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, the China National Space Administration said. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a highway collapse in Guangdong province increased to 48 on Thursday, as President Xi Jinping called for the utmost efforts to save lives and eliminate dangers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heavy rains caused a stretch of road running from Meizhou city towards Dabu county to cave in at around 2.10am on Wednesday, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles careened into the nearly 18-metre-long gash in the tarmac and plummeted down the steep slope below. The highway collapse had trapped over 20 vehicles, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media called the road collapse a "natural geological disaster" caused by the "impact of persistent heavy rain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 500 people have been dispatched to help with the rescue operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that Xi is highly concerned about the incident and gave important instructions on the rescue and relief work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said efforts should be made to repair the damaged roads and restore traffic order as soon as possible, and that all regions and relevant departments must strengthen monitoring and early warning, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property as well as overall social stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, massive downpours in a different part of the province sparked floods that claimed four lives and forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a tornado killed five people when it ripped through Guangzhou last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rainfall expected to intensify throughout May, the government has warned of possible further disasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Multiparty discussions and evaluations indicate that strong convection and heavy precipitation may increase in China in May," Xinhua cited the emergency management ministry as saying. (Agencies)
