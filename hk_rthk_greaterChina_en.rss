 At least six people have been killed in a fire that swept through a shopping mall in Sichuan province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thirty others were rescued from the blaze in the city of Zigong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Six people have been killed at the moment. The rescue teams are continuing search and rescue," CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage shown by the broadcaster and shared on social media showed thick black smoke rising from a building in Zigong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire started in the early evening in the shopping centre at the foot of the 14-storey building. CCTV said it was put out by 8.20pm. (AFP)

    China voices support for Palestinian factions meeting

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed willingness to facilitate "reconciliation" between rival Palestinian factions, after Fatah said its officials would meet in Beijing with Hamas counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas later said it would be attending talks in the Chinese capital at what it called an "expanded factional meeting" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement responded with a positive spirit and national responsibility," official Hossam Badran said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas was "keen on achieving national unity worthy of our Palestinian people... especially in light of the Al-Aqsa Flood battle," he added, using the militant group's name for its October 7 attack on Israel that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing had "always supported all sides in Palestine to achieve reconciliation and unity through dialogue and negotiation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, he said, was "willing to develop dialogue and reconciliation, provide a platform and create opportunities for all sides on the Palestine issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to strengthen communication with all parties and work hard to realise the aim of Palestine's domestic reconciliation," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two Palestinian groups have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas' resounding victory in a 2006 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several reconciliation bids have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank, where Fatah is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Henan province on Tuesday issued an orange alert for rainstorm, the second-highest level in the country's four-tier weather warning system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From Monday to Tuesday morning, heavy downpours lashed many parts of the province, with a maximum precipitation of 638.5mm recorded in Sheqi County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The province's meteorological observatory has forecast heavy rain to fall in some areas till 9am on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's northern regions are bracing for extreme weather conditions. According to a meeting held on Monday by authorities including the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, the main rain belt is expected to move northwards in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will bring heavy rainfall to the Sichuan Basin and the Huanghuai region, encompassing parts of several provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management has ordered relevant provincial-level regions to focus on vulnerable areas, including flood-prone rivers and urban drainage systems. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 34-year-old man, allegedly linked to the suspected murder of a Chinese woman in Thailand, was arrested in Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yan Ruimin, a 38-year-old influencer, went missing during her solo trip to Thailand and is suspected to have been dismembered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect allegedly fled to Macau after the woman's death and tried to pawn a fake watch at a shop last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the shop staff were suspicious and reported him to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers eventually caught him at the Taipa Ferry Terminal and handed him over to mainland police on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the investigation, Macau police were informed by mainland authorities that the suspect could be hiding in Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After checking his identity, it was confirmed that he was the suspect in the murder case.

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

 The Chinese Olympic Committee announced on Saturday that it will send 405 athletes, including 42 Olympic champions, at an average age of 25 to the Paris Olympic Games, which will open on July 26.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The delegation is made up of 136 men and 269 women athletes, with 37-year-old women's race walker Liu Hong the oldest competitor and 11-year-old women's skateboarder Zheng Haohao the youngest.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey plans to draw on its geographical position and an EU customs deal to entice Chinese investors keen to access European markets tariff-free, as it recently just did with carmaker BYD.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant signed a billion-dollar deal with Ankara on Monday to open a plant in western Turkey, promising to create 5,000 jobs, a move that will help it avoid new EU tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, is in talks with other Chinese companies, Turkey's Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kacir said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to transform Turkey into a production centre for the next generation of vehicles," Kacir told private broadcaster Haberturk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister emphasised his country's selling points, including being part of the EU's customs union and having trade agreements with 28 countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese producers want rapid access to international markets," he said. "Investing in Turkey offers them that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ankara struck a customs deal with the EU in 1995 that enables the free flow between them of a number of goods, notably cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey became one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry starting in the 1970s, when major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there -- with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new regulations on investment incentives, BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey originally imposed on electric vehicle import - Manufacturers investing in the country will be exempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish manufacturer TOGG and Chinese firm Farasis have also partnered up to produce EV batteries in Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish officials have held numerous meetings with Chinese industrialists in the last year, according to the industry ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's foreign affairs minister Hakan Fidan visited China in June to seal a new bilateral deal, calling the countries "drivers of Asian wealth." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said on Friday it was conducting joint military drills with Russia along its southern coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry said the two militaries had begun the exercises, called Joint Sea-2024, in early July, and they would last until the middle of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drills in the waters and airspace around Zhanjiang, in Guangdong province, are "to demonstrate the resolve and capabilities of the two sides in jointly addressing maritime security threats and preserving global and regional peace and stability", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the exercises "will further deepen China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese forces are also staging drills this week with Belarus near Poland.

 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has criticised a move by Germany to remove Chinese telecom components from its 5G networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany on Thursday said it will phase out the use of components made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks, citing national security concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said critical components from Huawei and ZTE will be barred from 5G core networks by the end of 2026, while “critical management systems” from the two manufacturers in 5G access and transport networks must be replaced by the end of 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Berlin said Germany's decision was based on "groundless accusations", adding that Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE have long operated in the country in compliance with laws and regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement also said the move by Berlin would severely damage mutual trust and affect future cooperation between China and the European Union in relevant fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei said there was no specific evidence that the firm's "technology has cyber security risks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Huawei has developed into a continuously innovative, secure, and reliable telecom equipment supplier in the German market," a spokesperson said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China does not accept the groundless accusations made at the recent Nato summit in Washington against Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a phone call with his Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp, Wang said Nato should stay within its bounds and refrain from interfering in China's or Asia-Pacific affairs, and from challenging Beijing's legitimate rights and interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foreign minister said China and Nato countries have different political systems and values, but this should not be a reason for the alliance to "instigate confrontation with China".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing is willing to maintain contact with Nato on "an equal footing" and conduct exchanges on the basis of mutual respect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato has accused China of playing a key role in helping Russia's assault on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On ties between China and the Netherlands, Wang said Beijing is willing to strengthen cooperation with Amsterdam to jointly safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veldkamp said the Dutch side does not support "decoupling" from China and is willing to maintain communication with Beijing. (Xinhua, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    China warns Nato against 'provoking confrontation'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday warned Nato against "provoking confrontation" over its ties with Russia, after the alliance accused it of playing a key role in helping Moscow's assault on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said a declaration from Nato leaders from their Washington summit was full of "belligerent rhetoric" and the China-related content has provocations and lies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nato statement claimed that China had "become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine", and that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed Beijing's "so-called 'no limits' partnership" and "large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base" were of "profound concern".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said: "Nato should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is known to all that China is not the creator [of] the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war, but did not get into specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also repeatedly hit out at Nato criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top officials of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, in attendance at Nato, have forged stronger ties with the security alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said: "We firmly oppose Nato acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

 Mainland customs officers have caught a man at a border crossing point between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with over 100 live snakes stuffed in his trousers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news of the reptilian round-up was announced by China Customs on its official WeChat account on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers at the Futian boundary control point recently stopped the man, who was passing through the checkpoint without making any declarations, for an inspection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found 104 live snakes in six sealed drawstring bags that were in the man's pockets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were five types of reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, with most of them being introduced species.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

 China has allocated an additional 848 million yuan to support local flood rescue efforts, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fund, allocated by the MOF and the Ministry of Water Resources, will mainly be used to assist rescue work by local authorities in the flood-hit regions, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Guangdong provinces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, rescue personnel successfully sealed a 226m breach in a dyke at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, on Monday, according to local authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.31pm, the final truckload of rocks was dumped into the breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sealing will expedite drainage and post-disaster reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The breach at Dongting Lake in the city of Yueyang in Hunan was caused by floodwaters from torrential rain, with more than 7,000 residents evacuated since the dyke burst on Friday afternoon. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An embankment seen as the second line of defence following a dyke breach in Hunan province was under threat on Monday, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 300 police officers and firefighters were working at the site to stem the piping effect that is eroding the embankment in Huarong County, said the province's water resources department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14.3km embankment is located around 2km behind the dyke that burst on Friday at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, following a heavy rainstorm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The piping effect can hollow out a dyke and lead to a burst if not properly handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 7,000 residents have been evacuated following the dyke burst on Friday, and workers have been racing against time to seal the 226m breach. (Xinhua)

  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".
  <br/>
  <br/>

  Li said China and Britain are both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major economies, adding that greater cooperation between the two nations not only serves the interests of the two, but also helps the international community address global challenges.

  Li said the Chinese government attaches great importance to its relationship with Britain, and stands ready to work with the new British government to consolidate mutual political trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, support the economic and social development of both countries, and jointly promote world peace, stability, and prosperity.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry announced on Friday that it will hold an anti-dumping hearing on brandy imported from the European Union on July 18.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will be about "industrial damage, cause and effect, and public interest in the anti-dumping probe of related brandy products", Xinhua News Agency quoted an online statement by the ministry as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing aims to ensure that the investigation procedure is fair, just and transparent, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's anti-dumping probe into EU brandy products would look at EU-produced brandy in containers holding less than 200 litres imported from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the ministry has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also investigate any damage done to the Chinese brandy industry from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is expected to end before January 5, 2025, but may be extended for half a year under special circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement by the Commerce Ministry comes as the European Commission's provisional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its EV tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. It has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, but that it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also opened investigations into European pork imports. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday called on the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to ensure security in the face of real threat from the Cold War mentality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when attending the SCO summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the member states to adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address complex and intertwined security challenges through dialogue and coordination, and respond to the profoundly changing international landscape with a win-win approach, so as to build a world of lasting peace and universal security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the world is faced with accelerating changes unseen in a century, the human society is standing at a crossroads of history again, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president pointed out that the SCO stands on the right side of history, fairness and justice, and is of great significance to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SCO members should consolidate unity and jointly oppose external interference in the face of the real challenges of interference and division, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasised the group's focus on ensuring security of its members, and said the SCO will form a dedicated centre that will coordinate response to various security challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group's members will also endorse a special program to fight separatism and extremism. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a force for global stability at a summit of the regional body in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their second meeting in as many months, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should "uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations" in response to an "ever-changing international situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling Putin an "old friend", Xi alluded to the progress the two countries had made in putting in place "plans and arrangements for the next development of bilateral relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said the two sides should continuously conserve the unique value in China-Russia relations, and explore the internal driving force of bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Putin said the SCO has “firmly established itself as one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order", adding that bilateral ties between Moscow and Beijing were at their best in history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our cooperation is not aimed against anyone, we are not creating any blocs or alliances, we are just acting in the interests of our peoples," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's spokesman later told state TV that the two leaders discussed Ukraine and agreed that peace talks without Russia's presence were futile. (Agencies)

 Premier Li Qiang has called for "unswerving" efforts to control floods and protect lives as heavy rain lashed various parts of the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also spoke about the need to strengthen preparedness and step up disaster relief and rescue efforts when inspecting flood-prevention work in the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a visit to a hydrological station, the premier highlighted the important role of forecasting and early warning in disaster prevention, urging efforts to strengthen interdepartmental joint consultation and improve the accuracy of forecasting.

 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi's entourage includes Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

    'Soft opening would have eased gridlock on new link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link officially opens

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration handed over the sample container to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) at a ceremony held in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the event, the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission Ge Ping told reporters that "we have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers will carry out the storage and processing of the samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples, collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilisation of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, CNSA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe was launched on May 3. Its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed in its designated area in Inner Mongolia on June 25, marking a complete success for the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to CNSA. (Xinhua)

    'Higher duty-free limit will boost HK retail'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government has condemned Taiwan for issuing a travel alert for Hong Kong, saying the island had smeared the city and its national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said the issuing of an "orange" alert by the Taiwan authorities warning residents against travelling to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau was a “political manoeuvre with fact-twisting smears and slanders exposing malicious intentions.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan had said the alert -- its second highest – was needed because the risk of travelling to Hong Kong had risen following the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR government spokesman countered that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty – just like it is in many common law jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Taiwan authorities turned a blind eye to the fact, made exaggerated remarks, maliciously smeared and demonised the NSL and the SNSO, completely unmasking its double standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that ordinary travellers – including those from Taiwan --  would not unwittingly violate the law, noting that national security offences target only an extremely small minority who endanger national security and the safety of Hong Kong.

    Expert predicts 'gradual' approach at third plenum

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Shanghai-based professor of politics said on Friday that he believes authorities will adopt a gradual approach to any major structural economic reforms that are implemented, amid the nation's post-pandemic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials in Beijing said on Thursday that the Communist Party of China will convene the third plenary session of its 20th central committee on July 15, focusing on issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney from the East China Normal University said there's a need to tackle insufficient demand in the domestic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, a major question that has dogged leaders is the extent to which they are ready to implement major structural reforms to the economy," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past week or so we've heard from the premier, for example at Davos, that those type of reforms aren't on the table presently, given the need to extend the recovery while facing some really big global uncertainties. Instead he's signalled a gradualist approach where the market plays a more decisive role."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahoney added that the government faced time constraints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, it's also clear that there are a number of reforms that are needed now and so we've got this rubric that's being promoted - it's not a new one, but it's become the catchphrase of the third plenum - 'comprehensively advancing reforms'", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Politburo meeting on Thursday chaired by President Xi Jinping, who's also general secretary of party central committee, the plenum will last until July 18.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Communist Party of China on Thursday said it expelled two former defence ministers for "serious violation of party discipline and the law".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two are Wei Fenghe and his successor Li Shangfu, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Wei and Li formerly served as members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and as state councillors, and were deprived of their qualifications as delegates to the 20th CPC National Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CMC's disciplinary and supervisory agency launched an investigation against Wei on September 21, 2023, and Li on August 31 of the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the results of the investigations, they were both found to have seriously violated political and organisational discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported Wei had "helped others gain improper benefits in personnel arrangements and also seriously violated discipline regarding integrity, accepting money and gifts in violation of relevant rules."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "As a high-ranking official of the party and the military, Wei lost his faith and loyalty. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the military, bringing enormous damage to the party's cause, the development of national defence and the armed forces as well as the image of senior officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Li had "sought improper benefits in personnel arrangements for himself and others, took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and accepted a huge amount of money and valuables in return", Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Li betrayed the party's original aspirations and its principles. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the equipment sector in the military and the ethics of relevant industries," according to Xinhua.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of giant pandas are on their way from China to the United States where they will be cared for at the San Diego Zoo as part of an ongoing conservation partnership between the two countries, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, and Xin Bao, a 4-year-old female, departed from Ya'an City in Sichuan Province on Wednesday evening, embarking on a 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks a new round of giant panda protection cooperation between the two countries, following an agreement signed in February between the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the San Diego Zoo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance were on hand in Sichuan for the farewell ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This farewell celebrates their journey and underscores a collaboration between the United States and China on vital conservation efforts," Paul Baribault, the wildlife alliance president, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our long-standing partnership with China Wildlife Conservation Association has been instrumental in advancing giant panda conservation, and we look forward to continuing our work together to ensure the survival and thriving of this iconic species.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan and Xin Bao will transit through Hong Kong and are scheduled to arrive in the US on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The giant pandas are accompanied by experienced breeders and veterinarians during the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be several weeks before they will be viewable to the public in San Diego, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan's mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xin Bao is described as “a gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.” (Xinhua/AP)

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link to open on Sunday

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A mega transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan is expected to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes. Image: CCTV" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759256_1_20240627121736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan will open on Sunday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's expected to cut the travel time between the two Greater Bay Area cities to 30 minutes from the current two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to CCTV, the link will open to traffic on 3pm on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-kilometre link includes two bridges, two artificial islands and a two-way eight-lane sea tunnel, and took seven years to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It features the Lingdingyang Bridge, described as the world's largest offshore steel box girder suspension bridge, as well as a 6.8km sea tunnel, the world's largest and widest undersea steel shell concrete tube tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A cross-boundary bus service provider said it will increase the frequency of its service from Hong Kong to Zhongshan by about 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The general manager of Shum Kong Wing Lee Cross Border Bus, Freeman Cheung, said the company also plans to introduce an extra route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the agency he owns anticipates the number of tour groups visiting Zhongshan and Shunde will at least double over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new road will enable travel agencies to come up with new itineraries, including one-day trips to the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver surnamed Wang told RTHK that she has been travelling between Shenzhen and Zhongshan via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau Bridge, but plans to switch to the new road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s more convenient and closer. I can probably save half an hour per trip. The toll is also lower,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shenzhen taxi driver said he thinks the new road won't be of any use to him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he has never taken a passenger from Shenzhen to Zhongshan and this probably won't change just because the travel time is shorter.

  "The returner of [the] Chang'e-6 mission has landed successfully at Siziwang Banner, at the designated area. I would like to announce that the Chang'e-6 lunar mission has achieved a complete success," said Zhang Kejian, the director of the China National Space Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also extended his congratulations on the complete success of the lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a congratulatory message carried by state media, Xi said the "outstanding contributions" of the mission command "will be remembered forever by the motherland and the people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The re-entry capsule brought back lunar soil and rocks that it spent two days collecting by a drill and robotic arm from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth. It would be brought to Beijing for further studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre in Hainan on May 3, and descended into the moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday said the Chinese economy had gotten off to a "good start" this year, and that the nation will continue to strive to create an open environment for technological innovations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li made the remarks at a keynote speech at the opening of a World Economic Forum meeting – also known as Summer Davos – in Dalian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said: "The rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the start of this year the Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. It got off to a good start in the first quarter of this year... and continued steady growth in the second quarter. We're confident and capable in achieving the growth target of around five percent for this year," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also proposed that there should be a deepening of exchanges and cooperation in science and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Science and technology are key variables in future development and major sci-tech progress usually comes from unrelenting research accumulation and extensive cooperation," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier also told delegates that the nation's electric vehicles and lithium batteries were not only meeting domestic demand, but also enriching global supply amid trade tensions with the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 1,600 leading figures from the public and private sectors across nearly 80 countries and regions are attending the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions event which is being held until June 27. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the meeting Duda told Xi that relations between Poland and China remained strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russia-Ukraine conflict was on the agenda for talks, but no remarks on the issue were delivered before journalists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Over the past 75 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bilateral relations have maintained steady development, constantly injecting new vitality into the traditional friendship between the two countries,” Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides announced during the meeting that China would implement a 15-day unilateral visa-free policy for Polish citizens.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after the Commerce Ministry said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to consider both parties' reasonable concerns to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner, Wang said during a meeting with Habeck who is on a visit to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister added that China hopes that Germany will play a positive role in the EU, prompting the European side to meet China halfway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks," Habeck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. "We are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Habeck had said earlier on Saturday that the European Union's door was open for discussions regarding EU tariffs on Chinese exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission has announced provisional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese EVs by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has spoken out against the move, describing the higher duties as protectionist. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Long March 2-C rocket carrying a satellite jointly developed by China and France dubbed the Space Variable Objects Monitor, lifts off from a space base in Xichang, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said Friday that the European Union was to blame for escalating trade frictions with China, which could lead to a "trade war".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Responsibility lies entirely with the EU side," a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hoped the EU would meet it halfway, handle differences through dialogue and avoid escalating trade friction or allowing it to get out of control, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the European Commission proposed tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicle imports from China despite Beijing's protest, plunging trade ties to a new low and risking punitive action from the world's second-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry statement was published just before the arrival of German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Beijing, where he was expected to explain to Chinese officials the recent tariff announcement while allaying the risk of retaliation that could harm German businesses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Days of torrential rain, flash floods and landslides across southern China have forced authorities to enact emergency plans, as swollen rivers threaten to overflow further, potentially disrupting the lives of millions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Guangdong upgraded an emergency response plan for disasters like landslides and flooding to the second-highest level, helping to coordinate and deploy resources across the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other provinces have already activated a Level-IV emergency response for flood control as this year's flooding season kicked into high gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain and landslides in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have already killed at least nine people and left several people missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi in southwest China, raised a "red" flood warning signal, the highest level, late on Wednesday when the water level of the Li River, which runs through the city, reached 3.61 metres above the warning line, China Daily reported on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water level at the river's hydrological station in Rongjiang township hit a record high, threatening residents' lives and properties along the river, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guilin authorities urged departments, townships and scenic spots to help prevent and combat possible flooding in the coming days as water levels at major rivers continue to rise, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate to heavy rain is expected to start again from Friday through Monday in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in Asia, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. (Reuters)

  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday, renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with Malaysia," Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism and communications, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links topped the agenda of Premier Li Qiang's visit to the Australian city of Perth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China's economy has continued to rebound and improve, with its new growth drivers gaining momentum, against the backdrop of sluggish global growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the final leg of his trip to Australia, the premier said China was planning major measures for further comprehensively deepening reform and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, and the country's business environment will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip to Perth, Li inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Perth from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders on Monday held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two trading partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting. (Xinhua/AP)

 President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people have been killed in southern China from heavy rains that triggered landslides, knocked out power for entire villages and buried crops.

  Landslides triggered by severe flooding killed at least five people in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province.

  <br/>
  Fifteen others were missing, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four people were killed and two others were missing in Wuping county in Fujian province due to landslides caused by torrential rain.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday hit back at a G7 end-of-summit statement that took aim at China, accusing it of being "full of arrogance, prejudice and lies".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The G7 summit statement once again manipulated China-related issues, slandered and attacked China, rehashed cliches that have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no moral justification, and are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Group of Seven leaders met last week in Italy, souring trade relations with Beijing as well as tensions over Ukraine and the South China Sea were a focus of their discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement released at the end of the summit said China was sending dual-use materials to Russia which were helping Moscow's war in Ukraine. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)
