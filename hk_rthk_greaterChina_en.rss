<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Olympic Games less than two months away, dedicated Hong Kong-trained specialists are working tirelessly to ensure the country's elite athletes stay injury-free and perform at their very best in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For trainer Ivy Lui, a career highlight came when Liu Yang, one of the Chinese gymnasts she worked with, secured the gold medal on rings at last year’s World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I felt like my dreams from graduation have come true,” she said. “I knew I wanted to help an athlete achieve an honour at the international stage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gymnast also won gold in rings at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so he'll be defending his title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui's journey as a sports therapist began eight years ago when she graduated from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, a member institution of the Vocational Training Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending time with the Hong Kong Rugby Union, she began working with the gymnastics team in Guangzhou before joining the national gymnastics team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her days involve giving massages to the gymnasts, to help them relax after training sessions, and treating any injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her work goes beyond physical therapy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To ensure comprehensive preparation, we also recreate a live atmosphere and simulate actual playing time during our gym training sessions in China before going overseas,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dedicated professional Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from the Chinese University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang was already working with the national rugby team before he went on to pursue an advanced degree in Hong Kong, so he would have a deeper understanding of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The one-year study made my work more systematic,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we use force platforms to test athletes, which can indicate whether there’s discrepancy in their leg strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there is a big discrepancy, we will strengthen the weaker leg to prevent injuries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of Wang's key tasks is to make sure China's men and women rugby teams stay in top form, as they try to book a ticket to Paris through a qualification tournament later this month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Russia next week for a gathering of counterparts from the Brics group of emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang will meet with other foreign ministers for talks "on issues of common concern such as Brics cooperation and current and regional situations", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said that Brics is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries and that members "have always been committed to safeguarding multilateralism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting takes place on Monday and Tuesday in western Russia's Nizhny Novgorod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to work "to consolidate the Brics strategic relations, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, (and) promote shared development and joint self-reliance in the global South", Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bloc, its name derived from the initials of founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced last year a major expansion in membership, described at the time by President Xi Jinping as "historic". (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

    China women's hockey team hopeful for an Olympic medal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team has set their sights on a podium spot at this year's Olympics, even though they have a tough road ahead to clinch a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations have been underway for the Paris Games, with the team recently spending almost two months in the Australian city of Perth for a training programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhong Jiaqi, who's playing in her second Olympics, said the squad is more prepared this time than during the Tokyo Games in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we are more confident, and the whole team is in a very good condition,” Zhong said. “It could be because our result in the last Olympics was not satisfactory, so we want this year's Games to be good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow teammate and defender Zheng Jiali, who is representing China for the first time at the Olympics, said the team is aiming for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have strengthened techniques and strategies, as well as our fitness. There are overall changes and adjustments,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team achieved its best Olympic result on home soil during the 2008 Beijing Games, where they took silver. One of their coaches, Huang Yongsheng, said the team's success does not stop there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether it's 2008 or after 2008, the goal of the women's hockey team has never changed. We strive to do our best and always work to achieve the best results,” Huang said. “I feel like [the achievement in] 2008 is not our endpoint, it is just a starting point.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two years ago, Australia’s two-time Olympic gold medalist Alyson Annan took charge of the Chinese squad, and coach Huang said it has helped the team grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She brought some pioneering concepts from the West, merging them with what we already had in China, in the hope of better techniques and tactics that fit China more," Huang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team faces an uphill battle in Paris, having been placed in the same group as reigning Olympic champions the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other teams in the same group include Belgium, Germany, Japan and hosts France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team manager Guo Hong said he is certain the team will give their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everyone has an Olympic dream. But I think we should be realistic and do things gradually,” Guo said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for new overnight high-speed trains to the mainland went on sale on Wednesday, with the first service to Beijing selling out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains to the capital and Shanghai will run Friday-Monday from June 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queues for tickets formed at West Kowloon Station, while mainland app 12306 showed no places left for the first train to Beijing, although people could join a wait list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were really happy when we saw the news [regarding the new services], so we immediately decided to travel to Shanghai," a woman told RTHK at West Kowloon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The journey time was 19 hours before, and it's only 11 hours now. The duration is eight hours shorter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman said she arrived at the station 90 minutes before tickets went on sale, to book a spot on a train to Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the price, it's a bit expensive. Our tickets cost one thousand dollars each. But it's not convenient for us to travel by plane. We're old people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man said he normally drives to the mainland, but wants to try the overnight train instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically, I have to go to Beijing once a year and I like trying new things," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rising Chinese long jump star Zhang Mingkun said he is determined not to let the pressure get to him as he seeks qualification for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old said he is going to keep his mind at ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During a jump, your mind really goes blank. All you do is to enjoy it,” Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long jumper, who has a personal record of 8.13m, has been striving to reach the 8.27m entry standard for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll find out in about a month's time on whether his dream would come true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the rest of the track and field team, the sprinters have been training with a new foreign coach ahead of the Games, and they see the benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Here, our training is relatively traditional... but it’s more scientific overseas,” said runner Wang Shuang from Jiangsu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Female sprinter Huang Ziting knows that the odds are against them, but reaching the Olympic stage remains the ultimate goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m certain every athlete would want to stand on the Olympic podium, but it feels like it would be more difficult for Asians [to achieve that],” she said.

  Another sprinter, Chen Jinfeng, said getting to Paris requires not only strong performances but a bit of luck as well.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said tickets for overnight high-speed trains between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong would be available for sale from Wednesday noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overnight trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and West Kowloon Station from June 15 from Fridays to Mondays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said tickets would be available from Wednesday noon on the mainland's 12306 ticketing website or mobile app, and at ticket counters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares for one-way trips between Hong Kong and Beijing would be approximately between HK$937 and HK$1,448, while those between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be approximately between HK$682 and HK$2,128.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung welcomed the new arrangements which enhanced the services provided by the Hong Kong section of the express rail link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new sleeper trains...tailored to meet the passenger needs and provide them with a more convenient, comfortable and high-quality cross-boundary rail service, enhancing the travel experience for both business and leisure passengers," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Beijing resident said the new arrangement further encouraged him to visit Hong Kong one day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't like to travel by plane, so if high-speed trains have sleeping coaches, I won't feel tired even it's a long trip," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who's visiting Hong Kong, said she could manage time better if she travelled by high-speed trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to weather conditions these days, the situation of flight delays is very serious. My flight was delayed for almost eight hours, so travelling by high-speed trains may be more convenient," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said overnight high-speed trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from June 15, making transportation more convenient and cost-effective for passengers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Intercity passenger services, running at normal speed, used to carry travellers between Hung Hom and mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but all services were suspended following the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said high-speed trains would be used to replace the normal-speed trains, and trains would run to and from West Kowloon Station instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the overnight trains would run from Friday to Monday, and would feature sleeping coaches for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are departures at night time, meaning that you board the train at night, and you arrive at your destination the next morning. Passengers spend the evening on the train, and there are also sleeping coaches, so after a night's sleep, you will arrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very convenient, with a shortened journey time. You cut your travelling time by about 12 hours. You can also save on hotel accommodation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the journey time for overnight trains from West Kowloon Station to Shanghai and Beijing would be about 11 hours and 12.5 hours respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people would also be able to travel between Hong Kong and Hunan Province from June 15, with six new destinations including Zhangjiajie and Fenghuang Ancient Town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there would be more short-haul train services as well.

    Chang'e-6 lunar probe successfully lifts off from moon

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said a spacecraft carrying rock and soil samples from the far side of the moon lifted off from the lunar surface on Tuesday to start its journey back to Earth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ascender of the Chang’e-6 probe lifted off and entered a preset orbit around the moon, the China National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner -- like its predecessor Chang'e-5 -- was launched on May 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its lander-ascender combination touched down at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on June 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Missions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During its mission, the probe adopted two methods of moon sampling, including using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm. It automatically gathered diverse samples at different sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples collected will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the Inner Mongolia region on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission is the sixth in the Chang’e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e-5, which did so from the near side in 2020. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of China's top gymnasts said they have different ways of dealing with the pressure that comes with intense training ahead of the Paris Olympics, as they shared with RTHK their journeys to reach the highest level of their sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xiao Ruoteng, who won silver in the individual all-around and bronze in the floor event at the Tokyo Olympics, said he has been battling injuries, including shoulder, wrist and ankle problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old stressed the importance of pushing himself to the limit, adding that he still sees himself as a young athlete hungry for success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no going back if we want to get to the top. We have to do what ordinary people can't do... Although this will be my second time at the Olympics and people might think I'm experienced... my mentality is that of a first-time Olympian. I'm excited about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiao noted that the national team would focus on the team competition as a crucial opportunity to win the gold medal, which will then give them momentum in the subsequent individual events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan won gold on the parallel bars at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou acknowledged the pressure that comes with being in the spotlight, but said he got help from his teammates in handling that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all under pressure. Athletes need confidence during competitions, regardless of the pressure. Other athletes are under pressure too and I try to learn from my teammates. If they can handle it well, what can I do to be like them?" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qiu Qiyuan, a promising 16-year-old specialising in the uneven bars, said support from her coach and family helped her overcome the pressure and injuries she has faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pressure is definitely there, but we have to turn that pressure into motivation because if we can't take that pressure, there's no way we're going to fight for Olympic gold," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had this injury two years ago and I had an operation. It's not a big problem. I'm recovering well. Now I have adjusted mentally. My coach and my family are helping and encouraging me."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China believes all efforts should be recognised in supporting peace measures around the Russia-Ukraine war, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China has never "fanned fire or fuelled the flames", said Mao Ning, addressing a question on a peace summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia and China of attempting to undermine his planned global peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China attaches great importance to its relations with Ukraine and remains its largest trading partner, Mao said, adding that China's position on the peace conference is very "open and transparent".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that we can get the understanding and support of all parties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland is seeking a broad-based turnout from different parts of the world for the summit, which Bern hopes will lay the groundwork for a peace process in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    National team eye sweep of Olympic diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will be looking to complete a sweep of the gold medals in diving in the upcoming Paris Olympics, after falling just short in Tokyo three years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Zongyuan, who took gold in the men's synchronised 3m springboard at the Tokyo Games, said the national team are training hard, both physically and mentally, so they would make waves again in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China came first in seven of eight diving events in Tokyo, and Wang said it's the national team's dream to do even better this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, it is the entire diving team's dream to win all eight gold medals at the Olympics, but we have to do our best and work hard to keep on polishing our technique with just two short months before the Games begin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That way, we can thrive in the face of pressure and perform to the best of our abilities to hopefully capture those eight medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teenager Quan Hongchan, meanwhile, will be looking to defend her 10m platform title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guangdong native, as a 14-year-old, secured three perfect 10s to finish with an Olympic record 466.20 points in Tokyo, more than 40 points ahead of compatriot and silver medallist Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan said she will perform to the best of her ability in Paris, adding that a gold for either her or teammate Chen will bring honour to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For now, what I mainly want to do is perform my best dive, and not think of other issues. I will just think about my movements, how to do it, and how to dive well," Quan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, I do have confidence. No matter who wins gold between the two of us, as long as it’s a Chinese winning, that’ll be fine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen, who brought home a gold in the synchronised 10m platform event with Zhang Jiaqi in Tokyo, said members of the national diving team are very supportive of one another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since everyone is representing China, we should collectively aim to bring glory to our country. Whether it’s an individual or a pair event, we should fight hard and aim to bring honour together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the Olympics, we hope that everyone on the team can show their capabilities, their strength and their spirit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three athletes said their families, friends and fans have all been a big part of their athletic careers, so they want to do well to repay them.

    'Beijing committed to peaceful reunification'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence minister Dong Jun on Sunday said Beijing is committed to a peaceful reunification, calling the Taiwan issue a “core of core interests” for China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue conference in Singapore, Dong said the island’s Democratic Progressive Party was “pursuing separation in an incremental way” and was “bent on erasing the Chinese identity of Taiwan”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China stays committed to peaceful reunification, however, this prospect is increasingly being eroded by separatists for ‘Taiwan independence’ and foreign forces. The danger of national division is still there,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Chinese People’s Liberation Army will remain a strong force for upholding national reunification. We will take resolute actions to curb ‘Taiwan independence‘ and make sure such a plot never succeeds.“
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Anyone who dares to separate Taiwan from China will only end up in self destruction,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Dong told the security conference that China's military wants more military exchanges with the United States. His comments came after the first face-to-face talks in eighteen months between Chinese and US defence chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that many countries were closely monitoring Beijing's relationship with Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we see it, it is because the two militaries have differences that there is a greater need for communication," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we have different development paths, we should not pursue confrontation with each other."

 The national space agency announced early on Sunday that the Change'e-6 craft has touched down on the far side of the moon in a historic first for China’s space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The craft landed at the South Pole-Aitken Basin shortly before 6.30am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Change'e-6 will collect rocks and soil from the lunar surface for return to earth, the first time the moon’s far side has been studied in this way. The mission blasted off from the Wenchang base on Hainan Island a month ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese and American defence chiefs held talks in Singapore on Friday, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Dong Jun met with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between the defence chiefs of the two countries since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong and Austin began the talks at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of China-US relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides agreed after a summit between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks. That includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says it will halt tariff concessions from June 15 for some Taiwan products that currently enjoy preferential tariff rates stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), in response to the island's trade restrictions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement was made on Friday by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The special rates will be removed from 134 goods, including machine tools and industrial chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China in December suspended tariff concessions for some products under the ECFA, but the Finance Ministry said the island has not reciprocated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Taiwan region has unilaterally adopted discriminatory measures such as prohibiting and restricting the export of mainland products, which violates the provisions of the (agreement)," the ministry said. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced that China would host the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026, adding it would be another milestone in Beijing's relations with the Middle East region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the announcement as he delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.

  President Xi also called for a peace conference on the war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas as he addressed Arab leaders and diplomats.

  "The Middle East is a land bestowed with broad prospects for development, but the war is still raging on it," Xi said.

    Two giant pandas to head to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 2022. Two other giant pandas are heading to Washington's National Zoo later in the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will return giant pandas to Washington's National Zoo by the end of the year, US First Lady Jill Biden and officials said on Wednesday in a surprise announcement signalling a new era of panda diplomacy between the two superpowers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We are excited for children near and far to once again enjoy the giant pandas' adorable and joyful adventures at our @NationalZoo," the first lady posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing will send a new pair called Bao Li and Qing Bao under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a statement, hailing a "historic moment" that demonstrated the benefits of its partnership with Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, DC," said Brandie Smith of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, only a handful of the iconic black and white bears remain in the US, with three having left the national zoo in Washington six months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Xi Jinping said after meeting President Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to the United States as a gift, following then-president Richard Nixon's historic visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strained relations between the rival superpowers in recent years have led Beijing to call some of the pandas back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington – Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who arrived in 2000, and their three-year-old cub Xiao Qi Ji ("Little Miracle" in English) – flew back on a cargo plane to China in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The currently last remaining pandas in the US, at a zoo in the southern city of Atlanta, are due to return to China later this year, although China announced plans in February to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Egypt on Wednesday signed agreements deepening their cooperation during President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping and his Egyptian counterpart witnessed the signing in a ceremony that coincided with the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Egypt discussed bilateral relations and bringing stability to the Middle East in light of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a statement released by the Egyptian presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused a large number of innocent Palestinian civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely severe. China is deeply pained," Xi told el-Sisi, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top priority task now is an immediate ceasefire, in order to avoid spillover of conflict, impact on regional peace and stability, and so as to prevent a more serious humanitarian crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China is ready to work with Egypt to continue to assist the people of Gaza "and push for an early, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, have been engaged for months in talks aimed at securing a lasting truce between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreements signed between Beijing and Cairo on Wednesday include collaboration in the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state projects, including the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital east of Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investments between the two countries amounted to around US$14 billion in 2023, compared to US$16.6 billion in 2022, according to the latest data released by Egypt’s statistics agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment, and to further boost employment through development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a Politburo group study session, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We should] insist that employment of young people including college graduates is a top priority," Xi told the session. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilise the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for efforts to deepen the reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China created 4.36 million new urban jobs in the first four months, human resources ministry data showed, 36 percent of its annual job creation target. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning says Beijing called on all parties in the Gaza conflict to protect civilians and civilian facilities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)

    Douyin to tighten regulations for viral posts

    <![CDATA[<img alt='Douyin says it guides creators to record "true, good lives". File photo: AFP' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755047_1_20240528163706.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese social media giant Douyin has said it will start cracking down on posts that use so-called "hot events" to boost views, after state media reported that accounts for multiple influencers known for showing off their lavish lifestyles had been blocked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement released on Monday, Douyin said these videos use scenarios, such as staged medical crises or domestic disputes, in a bid to go viral.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Douyin guides creators to record true, good lives," the company added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes after Global Times newspaper earlier this month said the Douyin account belonging to content creator Wang Hongquan – which had more than 4.3 million followers – was no longer accessible last week amid a crackdown on influencers who flaunt their wealth online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang's Douyin page had featured videos where he showed off designer outfits, first-class flights and his jade jewellery collection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A screenshot of his Douyin profile page showed that the account had been banned for violating the platform's regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese social media platforms, including Tencent, Kuaishou, Weibo and Little Red Book, had jointly issued a statement on May 15 saying they will crack down on those showing off their wealth, according to Global Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Douyin said they removed over 4,701 pieces of inappropriate content and closed 11 accounts from May 1 to 7, while Little Red Book cleaned up more than 4,200 posts and shut 383 accounts in two weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, "Sister Abalone", a woman who filmed her elaborately decorated mansion and was regularly seen dripping with diamond and pearl necklaces, also appeared to have been targeted, with her videos on the YouTube-like Bilibili site no longer visible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And "Young Master Bo", an influencer who filmed himself test-driving Rolls-Royces and splurging on rare Hermes Birkin bags, was also missing from Douyin, with his account showing an error message that said he had "violated relevant laws and regulations". (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Shanghai rolls out measures to boost property market

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Shanghai have unveiled a set of measures to provide further targeted support for homebuyers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nine measures unveiled on Monday aim to meet the diversified living needs of residents, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They include easing home-purchase restrictions further for non-Shanghai residents and divorced couples, and allowing families with two or more children to purchase an additional home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai also said it would reduce the minimum down payment for commercial housing mortgages to 20 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement followed similar moves in major cities such as Hangzhou and Xi'an this month, reducing purchase restrictions for first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities had imposed restrictions and tough credit requirements on home purchases well over a decade ago in an effort to tamp down soaring prices and speculation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But they are now reversing those policies in a bid to stem an economic slump characterised by a debt crisis among developers, low demand and falling prices. (Additional reporting by AFP)

    Security still a factor in trilateral talks: academic

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang (right), Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (left) and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol hold a press conference.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A political academic in Shanghai has described trilateral talks between China, Japan and South Korea as a step in the right direction, although he said the security stances of Tokyo and Seoul may be problematic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Josef Gregory Mahoney from East China Normal University said Japan and South Korea had recently been gravitating towards the Aukus defence pact - between the US, Australia and the UK - and it remained to be seen how things would play out after the US presidential election later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main issues of whether Japan and South Korea will continue to draw closer to the US, as we've seen, especially since President Yoon took office in Seoul and whether or not we'll see a change in the US presidency this November and how that would affect US strategic positioning where we've seen, of course, Biden playing a very powerful role in advancing the Indo-Pacific concept and moving forward with Aukus," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And, of course, we've had recent reports that South Korea and Japan will be cooperating with Aukus, which most people interpret as a new sort of Pacific-based Nato that is the foremost part of American containment strategies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two-day talks in Seoul, which began on Sunday, were the first direct dialogue between the three countries in more than four years with Premier Li Qiang meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Mahoney also said he did not think a free trade pact would emerge soon, despite the countries agreeing to work towards one.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China, Japan and South Korea have agreed to discuss speeding up talks for a trilateral free trade agreement, according to a joint statement released on Monday following their three-way summit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries also reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearised Korean Peninsula at the ninth Trilateral Summit Meeting in Seoul.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The summit brought together Premier Li Qiang, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three countries announced they would keep discussions for speeding up negotiations for a trilateral free trade deal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said they had agreed not to turn "economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the leaders had "decided to create a transparent and predictable environment for trade and investment, and to establish a safe supply chain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After their talks, Li, Kishida and Yoon joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade among the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Premier Li called on relevant parties to exercise restraint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit, a move that violates United Nations sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would undermine regional and global peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said China, Japan and South Korea should properly handle sensitive issues and differences, and take care of each other's core interests and major concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon said the three leaders agreed to promote people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and work together to tackle shared environmental, health and other issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The trilateral cooperation system should be strengthened. We have decided to hold trilateral summits on a regular basis," Yoon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida said the three countries share a big responsibility for regional peace, and that Japan will chair the next round of the trilateral meeting. (Xinhua & Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Monday called on relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent further complications of the situation on the Korean Peninsula as China, South Korea and Japan kicked off a trilateral summit between the three countries in Seoul.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the premier said all parties should play a constructive role in pushing forward the political settlement process of the Korean Peninsula issue, and maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noting the current situation on the Korean Peninsula continued to be tense, Li said all parties should commit to easing the situation and restarting dialogue at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media also reported that Li urged South Korea and Japan to reject "protectionism" and economic decoupling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, business leaders from China, South Korea and Japan agreed to step up their trilateral cooperation in a bid to revitalise trade and stabilise supply chains, they said in a joint statement on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint statement said the three-way partnership had become a "more pressing task" after experiencing slowing economies in each country. (Xinhua/AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Profits of China's major industrial firms increased 4.3 percent year on year in the first four months of the year, official data showed on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The growth rate was the same with that registered in the first quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For April alone, profits were up 4 percent, versus a 3.5 percent slide in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial firms with an annual main business revenue of at least 20 million yuan saw their combined profits reach 2.09 trillion yuan during the January-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pickup in earnings followed export-led growth in factory output over the past month while retail sales unexpectedly slowed, underscoring uneven recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Domestic effective demand remains insufficient while the external environment is still complicated and severe," said NBS statistician Wei Ning in a separate statement, noting that the foundation for improvement in industrial profits needs to be consolidated. (Xinhua/Reuters)

 Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as well as leaders of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Tunisia will visit China this week, Beijing's foreign ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The leaders will from May 28 to June 1 "pay state visits to China and attend the opening ceremony of the 10th Ministerial Conference of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum", foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation will be Bahrain's King Hamad, Tunisian President Kais Saied and the UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting with Arab leaders in Beijing comes as China continues its role a mediator in the conflict between the Palestinian group Hamas and Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has historically been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and supportive of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and President Xi Jinping has called for an "international peace conference" to resolve the fighting. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a trilateral summit with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts. It's their first three-way talks in more than four years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three countries agreed to hold a summit every year starting in 2008 to boost regional cooperation, but the initiative has been disrupted by tensions and the Covid-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Their last trilateral summit was in late 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in Seoul said South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Li will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yoon is set to hold bilateral talks with Li and Kishida ahead of their three-way gathering on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kishida is also expected to meet separately with Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials and diplomats in Seoul warned not to expect breakthroughs on sensitive issues but said the summit could make progress in areas of practical cooperation like people-to-people exchanges and consular matters. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 "Black Dog," about a man released from prison who returns home to his remote town in China to rid it of stray dogs before the Olympics, only to befriend one of them, won the Cannes Film Festival's "Un Certain Regard" competition on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eddie Peng, who stars as Lang in the film by director Guan Hu, attended the ceremony at Cannes along with greyhound Xin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the second prize in one day for Xin, who donned the Palm Dog red collar after being picked for the Grand Jury Prize at a separate ceremony celebrating canine performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "Un Certain Regard" jury prize went to the French film "The Story of Souleymane," director Boris Lojkine's feature about a Guinean immigrant's struggle to survive in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best director prize was given to both Italy's Roberto Minervini for "The Damned" and Zambian-Welsh auteur Rungano Nyoni for "On Becoming a Guinea Fowl," while "Norah," by Saudi Arabian director Tawfik Alzaidi, received a special mention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan headed this year's five-strong jury for the competition focused on arthouse films that runs parallel to the main competition, the Palme d'Or.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were 18 films in total competing for the prize. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army on Friday continued joint drills surrounding Taiwan Island.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Integrated operations inside and outside the island chain are being conducted to test the command's capabilities to jointly take control of battlefield and launch joint strikes, and to seize control of crucial areas, according to Li Xi, spokesperson for the theatre command.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A coast guard fleet conducted law-enforcement drills in the waters east of the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gan Yu, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the drills focused on subjects including verification and identification as well as warning and expulsion to test the capabilities of joint maritime patrol and emergency response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China said the two-day military exercises, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, were launched to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and strongly punish separatist forces seeking "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing, spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end and China will never waver in its resolve to safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. (Xinhua)

 Premier Li Qiang will attend a trilateral summit with the leaders of Japan and South Korea on May 26-27 in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.

  It'll be the first such meeting in more than four years.

 One person was killed and three others were injured in an explosion in a residential building in Harbin, capital of the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local authorities suspect an exploding gas tank caused the blast which occurred at around 7am on Thursday morning in Xiangfang District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dashcam footage from a nearby vehicle driving along a highway showed a plume of smoke suddenly appearing, and debris strewn across the road, slowing down surrounding traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The injuries to the three people are not life-threatening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Further investigation into the cause of the explosion is underway. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command on Thursday started joint military drills surrounding Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drills – which began at 7.45am – are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait, the north, south and east of Taiwan Island, as well as areas around the islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu, and Dongyin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xi, theatre command spokesperson, said military services including the army, navy, air force and rocket force of the theatre command are being organised to conduct the joint drills, codenamed Joint Sword-2024A, from Thursday to Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drills focus on joint sea-air combat-readiness patrol, joint seizure of comprehensive battlefield control, and joint precision strikes on key targets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the drills also serve as a strong punishment for the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces and a stern warning against the interference and provocation by external forces. (Xinhua)

 China will continue to strengthen strategic cooperation with Iran, safeguard common interests, and make endeavours for regional and world peace, state media reported on Wednesday, citing comments from Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang made the remarks in talks on Tuesday with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahdi Safari, while attending a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Iran has lost outstanding leaders and China has lost good friends and partners, said Wang, according to Xinhua News Agency. "In this difficult time, China firmly stands by Iranian friends", he said, referring to the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Safari, for his part, thanked President Xi Jinping and Wang for expressing condolences at the earliest opportunity on the deaths of Raisi and Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and thanked China for its steadfast support for Iran.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that Iran's domestic and foreign policies will remain unchanged, and the country will continue to advance the process of national development under the leadership of the supreme leader.

 The Taiwan Affairs Office said the new leader of the Taiwan region, William Lai, sent "a dangerous signal" by seeking "Taiwan independence" and making provocations to undermine cross-strait peace and stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to Lai's speech as he took office on Monday, Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Chen Binhua said while the mainstream public aspiration on the island is for peace and development, Lai has ignored the public opinion, exposing his nature of being "a worker for Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen also said Lai sought independence by relying on foreign support.

  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said "Taiwan independence" is a dead end.

  "No matter how the political situation in Taiwan changes, it will not change the historical and legal fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China," Wang said. (Xinhua and agencies)

  The Commerce Ministry placed General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Boeing Defence, Space & Security on its "unreliable entities list".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms will be barred from engaging in China-related import or export activities, and are forbidden to make new investments in China. In addition, senior executives of the companies are prohibited from entering China, while their work permits will be revoked, along with their visitor and residential status, and the related applications they submit will not be approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move is the latest in a series of sanctions Beijing has announced in recent years against defence companies for weapons sales to the island. (Xinhua & agencies)

 Two Chinese warships docked on Sunday at a commercial port in Cambodia in preparation for joint naval exercises between the two countries, with Beijing's ambassador hailing their "ironclad" friendship.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan amphibious warfare ship and Qijiguang training ship sailed in to the Sihanoukville Port, as part of 15 days of land and sea drills involving 760 Chinese military personnel along with around 1,300 Cambodians and 11 Cambodian vessels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Qijiguang bore a banner reading "Bring peace and friendship to meet good friends" as it approached the port.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are ironclad friends," Chinese ambassador Wang Wentian told reporters on the shore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The cooperation between the two armies, between China and Cambodia, is conducive to the security of both countries and the security of the region."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Jingangshan and the Qijiguang are due to take part in exercises from the Ream Naval Base.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The joint training is the naval component of the ongoing Golden Dragon exercises, which are regularly held between the two countries. (AP & AFP)

    'Xia values Macau as an international metropolis'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing official Xia Baolong highly values Macau's position as an international metropolis and its cooperation with nearby Hengqin, Macau Chief Executive Ho Iat-seng said on Sunday as the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office wrapped up his week-long inspection trip to the gambling hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During his visit, Xia met representatives from various sectors, including healthcare, education and technology, to learn more about the latest social and economic developments in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said the senior Beijing official described Macau as "the apple of the motherland's eye" and stressed the need to use its advantages to build a "golden business card".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From my understanding, Director Xia's visit this time is to make an assessment of the current term of the SAR government. It's a great support for our work. They provide suggestions on areas where our work is insufficient," the Macau leader told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding our existing problems, they convey what the central government expects from us in meetings with executive, legislative and judicial bodies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Xia's second visit to Macau in as many years and came ahead of the 25th anniversary of the SAR's handover and a new term of government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said Xia didn't mention the Macau CE election during the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, he emphasised a lot the 'golden business card' of Macau, and he also emphasised that Macau is now an international city, or an international cosmopolitan," Agnes Lam, associate professor at the University of Macau and a former lawmaker, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think he didn't mention 'international' that many times last time. I think this is a new emphasis for Macau."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip, Xia visited the Guangdong-Macau In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and inspected a number of projects there, and Lam believes it shows the central government wants quicker integration of Macau and Hengqin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they urge the progress to be faster. This time, I think Director Xia also visited several key projects, including a residential project named Macau [New] Neighbourhood. And also he asked the whole society to support the government to speed up that project. So I think he also sent a stronger message about we should progress with that project."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Harbin on Friday to promote trade ties between the two nations on the final day of his state visit in China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lying just a few hundred kilometres from the border with Russia, Harbin has long served as a key hub for cross-border trade and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian president attended the opening ceremony of a China-Russia trade expo and was accompanied by Vice President Han Zheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Putin hailed energy ties between the two countries and promised to "strengthen" them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Russia is ready and able to continuously power the Chinese economy, businesses, cities and towns with affordable and environmentally clean energy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the world is on the threshold of the next technological revolution, we are determined to consistently deepen bilateral co-operation in the field of high technologies and innovations," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin arrived in Beijing on Thursday on his first trip abroad since his March re-election, meeting President Xi Jinping for talks in which the leaders framed their nations' ties as a stabilising force for the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men later ditched their ties for a less formal meeting over tea at the Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Footage from broadcaster CCTV also showed the leaders embracing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An editorial in the Global Times newspaper on Friday cited the importance of burgeoning trade ties between the two countries, saying China had been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 straight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These achievements are not easy and have been achieved by both countries overcoming various external challenges and unfavourable factors, highlighting the solid foundation of the China-Russia relationship," the editorial said. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday announced some of its most sweeping measures yet to stabilise and revive the country's beleaguered property sector, allowing local governments to buy "some" apartments, relaxing mortgage rules and pledging further efforts to deliver unfinished homes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier, fresh data showed the fastest drop in new home prices in more than nine years, highlighted continued problems for an industry which at its peak accounted for a fifth of economic activity and remains a major drag on confidence and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vice Premier He Lifeng told an online meeting with other authorities that municipal governments could buy homes at "reasonable" prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The homes would be used to provide affordable housing, He said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vice premier also said local governments could repurchase land sold to developers, and promised authorities would "fight hard" to complete stalled projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the People's Bank of China said it would further lower mortgage interest rates and down-payment requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers soared following the announcement. (Agencies)

    HK court delays Country Garden hearing till June

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition seeking liquidation of Country Garden. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753541_1_20240517125904.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court adjourned to June 11 a hearing of a petition on Friday seeking the liquidation of Chinese property giant Country Garden.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision provides some relief to the embattled developer amid Beijing's efforts to revive the crisis-hit property sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong firm filed the petition against Country Garden in February for non-payment of a US$205 million loan. The developer defaulted on US$11 billion of offshore bonds last year and is in the process of an offshore debt restructuring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Country Garden applied for the adjournment to prepare more evidence. The request was not opposed by the petitioner which filed the action against the company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If Country Garden is able to present progress on the debt restructuring talks with its offshore creditors, it would help the developer push back against the liquidation petition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key group of creditors, the ad hoc group of bondholders, have signalled their "neutral stance" towards the liquidation petition, according to the petitioner's lawyer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a letter to the court, the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, representing the ad hoc group, said they no longer intended to appear in the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing into the petition comes against the backdrop of Beijing stepping up efforts to revive the property sector, which slipped into an unprecedented debt crisis in mid-2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over the past few years, a growing list of developers has defaulted on debt repayment obligations and a handful of them, including China Evergrande, have been ordered to be liquidated. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was on Friday wrapping up his two-day state visit to China with a trip to the northeastern city of Harbin, which has historic ties with Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He will join trade and investment talks there a day after a meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping, who told him that China-Russia relations should be "cherished and cared for" by both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two also discussed the conflict in Ukraine, with Putin saying he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And hours after Xi and Putin met, US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said that China could not "have its cake and eat it too" with regard to the West and Moscow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It can't have it both ways and want to have [better] relationships with Europe and other countries while simultaneously continuing to fuel the biggest threat to European security in a long time," Patel said, referring to the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Alan Lung, a political analyst and Co-convenor (International) of the Path of Democracy think tank, said he believes that China is looking to play a mediating role in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are only two countries in the world that doesn't need another country and that is the US and Russia because of its vast territory, but China cannot do that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has bigger stakes and has to cooperate with the West, and this is why China, I think Xi Jinping, desperately wants to, if possible, broker peace in Ukraine on behalf of Russia, on behalf of the Europeans."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, Brian Yeung, who wrote a book on his time working in Russia, said he thinks China would not want the situation in Ukraine to undermine its ties with Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China might be the only, or at least the most important strategic partner to Russia," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Recently, Xi Jinping also visited Europe and had a very fruitful conversation with the French president. That also signals that China doesn't really want to mess up with Europe for the sake of the China-Russia relationship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xin Zhang, an associate professor at the School of Politics and International Relations at East China Normal University, said there are mixed opinions over the ongoing conflict, with some supporting Russia's narrative that the military operation is justified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also those who are very much on the pro-Ukraine side, looking at this as essentially a big power exploiting a small neighbouring power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The situation is complicated. There was a long, complicated historical cause for this conflict to escalate to such a degree. I try to emphasise that China is not the direct party in the conflict, and we would love to see a peaceful resolution through political negotiation."

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has pledged to work with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to "rejuvenate" their countries as the pair started a day of talks in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin, for his part, said he was grateful to China for trying to resolve the crisis over Ukraine, adding that he would brief Xi on the situation there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China hopes for the early return of Europe to peace and stability and will continue to play a constructive role toward this,” Xi said, speaking alongside Putin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing last year offered a broad plan for peace outlining general principles for ending the war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders also signed a joint statement on deepening China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership marking the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The China-Russia relationship today is hard-earned, and the two sides need to cherish and nurture it," Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to... jointly achieve the development and rejuvenation of our respective countries, and work together to uphold fairness and justice in the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that the two countries will continue to uphold a position of non-alliance and non-confrontation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian leader told Xi that their co-operation was a stabilising factor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is of crucial significance that relations between Russia and China are not opportunistic and are not directed against anyone," Russia's RIA Novosti news agency cited Putin as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin on Thursday began a two-day state visit to China that will include detailed talks on Ukraine, Asia, energy and trade with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin will also meet with Premier Li Qiang and visit the northeastern city of Harbin. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping told Russian President Vladimir Putin that China-Russia relations today have not come easily and should be cherished and cared for by both sides, state media said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when the two leaders met in Beijing, where he said China will be a good neighbour to Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this new journey, China will always be a good neighbour, friend and partner of mutual trust with Russia, and further consolidate the friendship of the people of the two countries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work together with Russia to achieve development and rejuvenation of our countries and uphold world equality and justice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin is in China for a two-day state visit. He was greeted by officials and an honour guard as he got off his plane in Beijing in the small hours of Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later in the morning, Xi held a welcome ceremony for Putin at the square outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During their meeting, Putin said: "Russia-China cooperation is not directed against any other power and is a stabilising factor for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election, and the second in just over six months to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before his visit, Putin, in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, had praised Xi for helping to build a strategic partnership between Beijing and Moscow based on national interests and deep mutual trust.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, Putin said: “We are open to a dialogue on Ukraine, but such negotiations must take into account the interests of all countries involved in the conflict, including ours.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are seeking a comprehensive, sustainable and just settlement of this conflict through peaceful means."

 Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Beijing's "genuine desire" to help resolve the Ukraine crisis, in an interview with Chinese state media published on Wednesday ahead of a two-day visit to the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Putin arrives in Beijing on Thursday to meet his "dear friend" Xi Jinping, seeking to win greater support from China for his war effort in Ukraine and isolated economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit, in which he will also travel to the northeastern city of Harbin for a trade and investment expo, is Putin's first trip abroad since his March re-election and his second in just over six months to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We commend China's approaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine," Putin told the Xinhua state news agency in a Moscow interview, which was also carried in English on the Kremlin website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Beijing is well aware of its root causes and global geopolitical significance," Putin said, referring to a 12-point position paper published by China in February 2023 on reaching a political settlement to the crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ideas and proposals contained in the document show the genuine desire of our Chinese friends to help stabilise the situation," Putin said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has spoken out against a move by the United States to hike tariffs on US$18 billion worth of Chinese imports such as electric vehicles (EVs), advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminium and medical equipment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tariffs are to be phased in over the next three years, with those that take effect in 2024 covering EVs, solar cells, syringes, needles, steel and aluminium and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariff rate on EVs is set to quadruple to 100 percent this year, the White House said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tariffs for semiconductors, meanwhile, will double from 25 percent to 50 percent by next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action is aimed at encouraging China to "eliminate its unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation," the White House said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry said China is opposed to the US tariff hikes and would take measures to defend its interests, urging Washington to cancel the measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said it's against unilateral tariff hikes in violation of World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China "will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests", spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency described it as "a protectionist move widely believed to imperil the American ambition to enhance competitiveness and slash carbon emissions".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tariffs come in the middle of a heated campaign between US President Joe Biden and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, in which both candidates are vying to show who's tougher on China. (Agencies)

 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said Russian President Vladimir Putin would make a two-day state visit to China from May 16 to 17.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying announced that Putin was coming at the invitation of President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry added Putin would meet Xi on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Kremlin also confirmed the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said this would be Putin’s first foreign trip since he was sworn in as president and began his fifth term in office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said Xi would discuss with Putin “cooperation in various fields of bilateral relations...as well as international and regional issues of common concern.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said Russia is increasingly dependent on China since the West hit it with sanctions over its military action in Ukraine.

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.
