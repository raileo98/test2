<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

Wang Yi meets Antony Blinken in Beijing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks across a range of complex issues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat is due to spend several hours with Wang across closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and a working lunch as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the "great ship" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, "but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China’s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken replied that "active diplomacy" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when they met in San Francisco in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy," Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that "we’re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese officials and state media have cast doubt over the extent of possible progress on several fronts, with a China Daily editorial saying that both sides "have been largely talking past each other".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US; and the US side should not turn it into one," it said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's latest Shenzhou-18 manned space mission blasted off on Thursday, with three astronauts making their way to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rocket, carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwest province of Gansu at 8.59pm. Xinhua reported that the crew completed their docking at about 3.30am and were able to board a couple of hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Lipeng, the centre's director, declared the launch mission a complete success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Long March-2F Y18 rocket has sent Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to the intended orbit accurately... I hereby announce that Shenzhou-18 has been launched successfully," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio will stay in orbit for six months, during which they will carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material and life science, space medicine and space technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will create an "aquarium" and raise zebrafish and algae in zero gravity, to study how the space environment affects their growth and the aquatic ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew will also cultivate plants in an experiment to help with designing crops that adapt to outer space conditions. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

Manage China-US relationship 'responsibly': Blinken

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China and the United States to manage their relationship "responsibly" as he went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, ahead of talks with top central government officials in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken's visit to Shanghai has seen him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting with Chen Jining, Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, America's top diplomat said US President Joe Biden was committed to "direct and sustained" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen too stressed the need to build stable ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken on Thursday also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the US was committed to welcoming Chinese students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also met American business leaders in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then headed for Beijing, where he's expected to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping on Friday. (AFP & agencies)

 The Transport Department said some high-speed rail services to and from the mainland were cancelled on Thursday due to bad weather conditions.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of State Antony Blinken (right) talks with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns (centre) and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Scott Walker, during a basketball game in Shanghai.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is due to meet business leaders in Shanghai on Thursday, the second day of a three-day visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is due to wrap up his visit in Beijing on Friday, with talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an increase in contacts between China and the US recently - including a summit between President Xi and President Joe Biden - a Shanghai-based expert says he's pessimistic about the future of relations between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remain a pessimist. I've been a pessimist on US-China relations since the Alaska meetings that took place shortly after Biden took office. I was hopeful that we would see a significant improvement after the Trump years," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics at East China Normal University, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very concerned that Trump may be re-elected. I think a lot of people in the world are concerned about that. But whether he's re-elected or not, you know, if Biden is re-elected or Trump, I think we all anticipate that things are going to continue to get worse," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mahoney stressed there were some areas where both countries must work together - in their own best interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that they have to cooperate on some very basic issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included the global financial system "because both countries depend on that substantially, not only for their own bilateral trade, but for the global trade system as a whole", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If China doesn't go along with the dollar or the way that the system works from the US point of view, then that threatens the US economy as well. So there is some shared concern there. We've also heard reports that they might be discussing other issues that won't be well-publicised, perhaps including militarisation in space," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said issues like climate change and increased cooperation seem to have "slipped far from the conversation, despite it being a growing existential concern" for both sides.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)

    China slams US military aid package to Taiwan

China slams US military aid package to Taiwan
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750359_1_L_20240424163309.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

China introduces fresh crew for Tiangong space station
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750316_1_L_20240424122837.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday introduced the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission, the latest in a programme that aims to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of astronauts will be led by Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye, along with Li Cong and Li Guangsu are scheduled to blast off at 8.59pm local time on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. They will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team who are currently on the Tiangong space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Jiuquan, Ye said the mission will be a special one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very special time and also carries special meaning. During the mission this time in China's space station, we will celebrate China's 75th anniversary of its founding and today is also China's ninth Space Day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye also stressed that China believes in international collaboration when it comes to space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us, we all actually pursue our dream to establish a space station, explore space, and also to make contributions. I believe we'll make great contributions to build a community of shared future for mankind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also sincerely invite our international peers to explore the vast universe together and to create a better future for mankind with joint efforts, and a China space station you can always look up to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tiangong is the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme – which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon – and made China the third country to put humans in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new crew will replace the Shenzhou-17 team, who were sent to the station in October, and stay in orbit for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhou-17 crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30. (Additional reporting by AFP and Xinhua)

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_L_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue operations were underway after unseasonably heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides in Yingde city in flood-ravaged Guangdong province, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes as the latest figures showed that four people have died as a result of the heavy rain, and 10 others are still missing. Provincial authorities have relocated some 110,000 residents so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue and emergency workers were seen tending to stranded residents on rescue boats in residential areas as well as commercial streets, in video aired by CCTV. The broadcaster also reported emergency supplies including food, water and other amenities were being provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one village, farmers stood at a flooded intersection along with belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everything's gone, all the seedlings are gone," said Huang Jingrong, 61.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all flooded, flooded beyond repair," he said, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, massive flooding has occurred in Beijiang River in the Pearl River basin on Monday due to the continuous heavy rain, according to the Ministry of Water Resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall since Thursday, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the region's annual flooding season. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell says China is adamant about clean sport. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749950_1_L_20240422120145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are so adamant on having clean sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

4 dead, 10 missing in Guangdong floods

<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Guangdong on Monday said four people were killed and 10 people were missing after continuous heavy rainfall hit many parts of the province over the past few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three deaths were reported in Zhaoqing City, while the remaining one is a rescuer in Shaoguan City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong's provincial emergency management department said search and rescue operations were still underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rain affected many cities including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, resulting in damaged houses, blocked roads and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it has so far relocated some 110,000 residents, with 25,800 people being urgently resettled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of homes either collapsed or were badly damaged, resulting in an economic loss of over 110 million yuan according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rainfall was forecast to continue over the coming three days across the southern regions, with rainstorms hitting parts of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the National Meteorological Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Persistent heavy rain has affected south China since April 19, with precipitation reaching record highs in several areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vast regions of the country's south and southwest were expected to see a 50 to 80 percent increase in precipitation in late April compared with the same period in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said due to the heavy rain, water levels in 44 rivers within the Pearl River basin had exceeded warning levels as of April 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China issued a yellow alert for rainstorms on Monday morning, the third most severe level in the country's four-tier, colour-coded weather warning system. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xie Feng said the Chinese and US sides had continued to work together in a number of areas.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.

    'Once a century' floods to hit southern China: CCTV

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in southern China injured at least six people and trapped others, state media reported on Sunday, as the region braced for severe floods "seen around once a century."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Torrential downpours across swathes of Guangdong province since Thursday have swollen rivers in the Pearl River Delta and triggered deluges in mountainous areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday that rains had sparked landslides affecting six villages in the northern Guangdong town of Jiangwan, "causing people to become trapped."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photographs published by CCTV showed waterfront homes destroyed by a wall of brown mud, and people in fluorescent-coloured ponchos sheltering in a soaked public sports court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No deaths were immediately reported and the total number of trapped people was not specified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But CCTV said six people who were "trapped and injured" in the landslides had been airlifted to the nearby city of Shaoguan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency workers were racing to restore communications to the stricken area "as soon as possible," CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that more than 80 rescuers were working "through the day and night" to assist people in the disaster zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pearl River Delta is China's manufacturing heartland and one of the country's most densely populated regions, with Guangdong alone home to around 127 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aerial footage by CCTV on Sunday showed murky flood-waters lapping close to street level in some towns, leaving riverside promenades and pavilions inundated and a pagoda protruding from the deluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have launched a level-two emergency response in the Pearl River Delta, the second-highest in a four-tier system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national weather office imposed weather alerts across central Guangdong and warned of major storms in coastal areas through Sunday evening and into Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the provincial hydrology bureau, CCTV said three monitored locations in the Bei River basin would "experience flooding seen around once a century... due to the impact of heavy precipitation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods of up to 5.8 metres above the warning limit would strike the areas starting early on Monday morning, according to CCTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other monitored tributaries in the basin would endure the kind of floods seen once every 50 years, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no initial reports of mass evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the neighbouring provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian were also forecast to see severe rainstorms. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triple world champion Max Verstappen took pole position on Saturday for the Chinese Grand Prix, 0.322 seconds ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso third.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.660 seconds to cap a perfect day after earlier winning the sprint race at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for Sunday's race, the first grand prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell's Mercedes eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a dominant day for the Dutchman who overcame electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the morning sprint, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win increased his championship lead over teammate Perez to 25 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Hamilton's joy at coming second in the sprint turned to despair in the first qualifying stint when the Englishman locked up near the end of his final flying lap, relegating him to only 18th fastest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first time since the 2022 Saudi Grand Prix that the seven-time world champion had been knocked out in Q1. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race on Saturday, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman charged past the seven-time world champion Hamilton's Mercedes on lap nine of the 19-lap dash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez was third after a thrilling battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first few laps were hectic," said Verstappen after claiming the eight points on offer for the winner of the first sprint of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wind is changing a lot which makes it difficult to drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once we sorted (the battery) out we were OK," Verstappen added as he extended his championship lead to 25 points over Perez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leclerc and Sainz ended up fourth and fifth after swapping places numerous times in the dramatic tussle for the minor places with Perez and Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin's Alonso came out worst as he went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris, having to retire his car on lap 18 with a puncture suffered in the skirmish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019, huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China's first Formula One driver, make his home debut in his third season in the premier racing class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for Sunday's main race sold out in minutes and fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started from 10th and in dry conditions for the race and moved up one place after the opening skirmishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou agonisingly finished just out of the points in ninth after being passed late on by Russell, who started down in 11th on the grid but made the most of starting on quicker soft tyres. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The top three in Sunday's Beijing half marathon have been stripped of their medals, organisers said, following an investigation into the finish that saw China's He Jie controversially win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Today the 2024 Beijing Half Marathon Organising Committee issued a decision on the investigation and handling of the men's race results," a state media report said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "The trophies, medals and bonuses will be recovered."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race's bizarre finish saw He cross the line first after two runners from Kenya and one from Ethiopia seemed to deliberately allow him to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were "punished" and their results cancelled, CCTV reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Athletics Association said earlier this week they had met, issuing a statement vowing to make improvements to the sport in the country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland immigration authorities on Thursday said the country saw a total of more than 141 million inbound and outbound trips in the first quarter of this year, up 117 percent from the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 60 million of the trips were made by residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, up 100 percent year-on-year. Thirteen million trips were made by foreign nationals, which was triple the number last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration (NIA) noted that a number of measures were introduced to boost cross-border travel in the first three months of the year, including visa-free entry policies with some foreign countries, as well as the individual visit scheme for residents of Qingdao and Xi’an to travel to Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it granted 1.98 million foreign travellers visa-free entry during the period, up over 260 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NIA spokesperson Lin Yongsheng said the trend of residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan heading to the mainland is continuing, as is the trend of mainlanders heading to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such traffic has resumed to the level seen in 2019, Lin said, with record breaking daily cross-border trips made at various ports in Hong Kong. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Indonesia want to maintain peace and stability in the region, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday after holding talks with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marsudi said the two countries would strengthen relations, and said Jakarta was looking to deepen cooperation and investment in energy transition, infrastructure and the downstreaming industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also called for all parties in the Gaza conflict to exercise restraint, and said the United States should support a United Nations resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both ministers expressed resentment over the humanitarian disaster due to the Palestine-Israel conflict. We agree that the UN Security Council resolution on a ceasefire must be fully implemented and without any condition," Wang said after the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang is on an official visit to Indonesia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea from April 18 to 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry has said he will chair the fourth meeting of the China-Indonesia High-Level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism and the seventh meeting of the China-Cambodia Intergovernmental Coordination Committee during the trip. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    China slams Biden calls for hikes in steel tariffs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In a speech addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh, US President Joe Biden accuses steel companies in China of cheating. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749405_1_L_20240418111247.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Embassy in the United States has criticised proposals by US President Joe Biden to impose higher tariffs on Chinese metal products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the embassy, Liu Pengyu, said "the US is making the same mistake again and again" by seeking higher tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, he also dismissed levies already in place as “the embodiment of unilateralism and protectionism of the US”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden on Wednesday called for sharply higher American tariffs on Chinese metal products as part of a package of policies aimed at pleasing steelworkers in the swing state of Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he campaigned for re-election in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Biden aides said he was proposing raising to 25 percent the tariffs imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump on certain Chinese steel and aluminium products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China's steel companies don't need to worry about making a profit," Biden said. "They're not competing, they're cheating and we've seen the damage here in America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is also pressuring neighbouring Mexico to prohibit China from selling its metal products to the US indirectly from there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration is launching an investigation into Chinese trade practices across the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors, which could lead to more tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commerce Ministry said the “US petition is full of false accusations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It ”misinterprets normal trade and investment activities as damaging to US national security and corporate interests," the ministry said in a statement. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin has spoken with Defence Minister Dong Jun. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749234_1_L_20240417104836.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence Minister Dong Jun has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, the first engagement the defence chiefs of the two countries have had in more than a year as Beijing and Washington seek to restore military ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry cited Dong as telling Austin on the phone that China and the US should explore ways to "get along" and "gradually accumulate mutual trust" by building a "non-conflict, non-confrontation", pragmatic and cooperative relationship between their militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong also said the US should recognise Beijing's position on the South China Sea, and respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests there. He also stressed that the Taiwan issue is "core of China's core interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and the US should... take peace as the most precious, stability as the most important," Dong told Austin, according to a ministry readout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The military sphere is the key... to stabilising the development of the relationship and preventing major crises from occurring," Dong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Austin "underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea", according to the Pentagon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said the two also discussed the Ukraine war, North Korea, and Washington's commitment to the one China policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phone call comes as President Xi Jinping and his counterpart, Joe Biden, have sought to manage tensions; the two leaders last year agreed to resume direct military talks. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that China and Germany should be vigilant against rising protectionism and view the issue of production capacity objectively.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said the industrial and supply chains of the two countries are deeply intertwined and their markets highly interdependent, and that co-operation was not a "risk" but a guarantee for stable ties and an opportunity for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must view and develop bilateral relations in an all-round way from a long-term and strategic perspective," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz arrived in China on Sunday for a three-day visit, his first since his government launched a "de-risking" strategy last year to avoid relying excessively on Chinese suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also coincided with European Union concerns about the threat to European businesses from Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and other green technologies, flooding its markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to students at Tongji University in Shanghai on Monday, Scholz called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while urging the EU not to act out of protectionist self-interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his meeting with Xi, Scholz also touched on areas where he said the two countries could cooperate, including climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders also discussed Ukraine, with Xi proposing four principles to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First, we should prioritise the upholding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains. Second, we should cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Third, we need to create conditions for the restoration of peace and refrain from further exacerbating tensions. Fourth, we should reduce the negative impact on the world economy and refrain from undermining the stability of global industrial and supply chains," Xi said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while also urging the European Union not to act out of protectionist self-interest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The one thing that must always be clear is that competition must be fair,” Scholz, who's on a three-day visit to China, told students at Tongji University in Shanghai, according to German news agency dpa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In other words, that there is no dumping, that there is no overproduction, that copyrights are not infringed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course we would like our companies to have no restrictions, but conversely we behave exactly how we are demanding here.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz is expected to raise the issue of fair competition at a meeting with President Xi Jinping on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German chancellor also made comparisons to reservations years ago when Japanese and Korean automakers entered the German market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There was great agitation in the newspapers: ‘Now the Japanese cars will come and clean up’... nonsense,” he told the Tongji University students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there are German cars in China that were made with Chinese manufacturers, and at some point there would also be Chinese cars in Germany and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Union is mulling tariffs to protect its producers against Chinese electric vehicle imports. But the head of Germany’s auto industry association, the VDA, expressed opposition to such tariffs ahead of Scholz’s visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hildegard Müller told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper the tariffs would not help the European and German auto industries and instead “could quickly have a negative effect in a trade conflict.” (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry in Beijing on Sunday expressed deep concern over escalation in the conflict in the Middle East, after Iran launched a massive drone and missile attack on Israel in response to an Israeli strike on its consulate in Damascus.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson for the ministry called on all parties to exercise calm and restraint after the attacks in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The ongoing situation is the latest spillover of the Gaza conflict,” the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There should be no more delays in implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2728 and the conflict must end now.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added: “China calls on the international community, especially countries with influence, to play a constructive role for the peace and stability of the region.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Sunday, the Chinese embassy in Iran advised Chinese nationals and companies in the country to strengthen security precautions, according to official broadcaster CCTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A UN Security Council meeting is scheduled to take place later on Sunday. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's top legislator and a senior North Korean official emphasised opening a "new chapter" of Beijing-Pyongyang relations, the North's state media said Saturday, as they met for one of the most high-level talks between the allies in years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing's third highest-ranking official Zhao Leji - the NPC Standing Committee chairman - is on a goodwill visit to the North as the two countries mark 75 years of diplomatic ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is North Korea's most important economic benefactor and diplomatic ally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhao and Choe Ryong-hae, who is the chairman of North Korea's Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, attended an opening ceremony for the "year of DPRK-China friendship" in Pyongyang on Friday, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said, using the acronym for the North's official name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with the DPRK to implement the important consensus reached by the top leaders of the two parties and the two countries, promote traditional friendship, deepen strategic mutual trust and enhance exchanges and cooperation, so as to jointly write a new chapter of the China-DPRK friendship," Zhao said in a speech, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  North Korea's Choe said the two countries' relationship "has greeted a new heyday under the wise leadership" of their leaders, KCNA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choe and Zhao were seen sitting next to each other watching performances by what KCNA said were "prestigious art troupes" of the two nations at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, AFP footage showed. (AFP and Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday urged the United States to play a "constructive role" in the Middle East during a phone call with his US counterpart Antony Blinken.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, China's top diplomat expressed Beijing's strong condemnation of a deadly Israeli airstrike that destroyed an Iranian diplomatic building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foreign minister emphasised the "inviolable" right to security of diplomatic institutions, and the need to respect the sovereignty of Iran and Syria.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said this round of escalation is the latest manifestation of the spillover from the Gaza conflict, adding that it's imperative for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that China will continue to play a constructive role in the resolution of the Middle East issue, and urged the US to do the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US State Department says Blinken asked Beijing to use its influence to dissuade Iran from striking Israel, after Tehran threatened to retaliate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iran had urged the international community to take action against Israel following the attack. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports contracted sharply in March while imports also unexpectedly shrank, underlining the task facing the country’s policymakers as they try to shore up a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Figures from the General Administration of Customs showed that shipments from China slumped 7.5 percent year-on-year to US$279.7 billion, marking the largest fall since last August and missing market forecasts of a 3 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came in sharp contrast to a 7.1 percent rise during the January-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, also declined last month, dropping 1.9 percent year-on-year to US$221.1 billion, missing an expected 1.4 percent rise. The first two months of the year had seen growth of 3.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures left the country’s trade surplus at US$58.6 billion last month, compared with US$125.1 billion in the January-February period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first quarter, however, both imports and exports rose 1.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By region, exports to the US fell 1.3 percent, while imports from the US fell nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Shipments to Russia rose 3 percent, while those from Russia rose 7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) remained China’s largest trading partner with exports to the region rising 4.1 percent during the first quarter and imports from the region growing 1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang Lingjun, vice minister of the General Administration of Customs, said that while geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism have brought challenges to global trade, there are signs of a gradual recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects the country’s trade to stabilise in the second quarter. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday criticised the United States, Japan and the Philippines and defended its actions in the South China Sea as "lawful" after US President Joe Biden hosted a trilateral meeting in Washington.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Biden on Thursday pledged to defend the Philippines from any attack in the South China Sea at the White House summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, China hit out at the joint summit in Washington, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning saying Beijing "firmly opposes the relevant countries manipulating bloc politics, and firmly opposes any behaviour that provokes or lays plans for opposition, and hurts other countries' strategic security and interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We firmly oppose engaging in closed cliques that exclude others in the region," Mao told a regular press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Japan and the Philippines can of course develop normal relations with other countries, but they should not invite factional opposition into the region, much less engage in trilateral cooperation at the cost of hurting another country's interests."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also summoned a Japanese diplomat on Friday to express concern and dissatisfaction over negative comments about it aired during a summit of the leaders of the United States, Japan and Philippines, the Foreign Ministry said. (Agencies)

    China relay satellite successfully enters lunar orbit

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Long March-8 rocket, carrying the relay satellite Queqiao-2 for Earth-Moon communications, blasts off at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in Hainan province, China on March 20, 2024. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1748592_1_L_20240412140452.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Queqiao-2 satellite has recently completed in-orbit communication tests, with its platform and payloads working normally, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA) on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The functions and performance of Queqiao-2 meet mission requirements, and it can provide relay communication services for the fourth phase of China's lunar exploration project and future lunar exploration missions of China and other countries," said the CNSA.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queqiao-2 will be used as a communications bridge between the ground operations on earth and upcoming lunar probe missions on the far side of the moon until at least 2030.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queqiao-2 researcher and developer Xiong Liang described the satellite as "the main switch" of the whole fourth phase of lunar missions, according to state television CCTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when the main switch is flipped on, all the communications can kick off," Xiong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The satellite successfully completed a communication test on April 6 with Chang'e-4, which is now carrying out an exploration mission on the far side of the moon. From April 8 to 9, it conducted communication tests with the Chang'e-6 probe, which is yet to be launched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queqiao-2 was launched on March 20 and entered its target highly elliptical orbit on April 2 after midway correction, near-moon braking and orbital maneuver around the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two communication and navigation technology test satellites, Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2, were sent into space together with Queqiao-2 and are now conducting a series of tests on communication and navigation technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The landing and sample collection sites of China's moon missions in the coming years are mainly in the lunar south pole region or on the far side of the moon.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight National Games competition events will be staged in Hong Kong as the SAR co-hosts the country's sporting extravaganza with Guangdong and Macau in November 2025.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Organising Committee of the 15th National Games announced after its inaugural meeting in Guangzhou on Thursday that the city will host track cycling, fencing, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, golf, triathlon, men's handball and men's under-22 basketball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR will also host bowling as a mass participation event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Games will be held between November 9 and 21, 2025. The opening ceremony will take place in Guangzhou and the closing ceremony will be held in Shenzhen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the first time that the SAR will be co-hosting the National Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A majority of the events will be held by Guangdong, while Macau will host 3x3 basketball, table tennis and women's volleyball.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These events are popular and highly competitive, they make for a good spectacle. So compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau can enjoy all these games at their doorsteps," said Zhang Xin of the General Administration of Sport of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that officials are designing the routes for marathon and road cycling that will go through all three places to promote further integration among them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, who led a Hong Kong delegation at the meeting, said the government will adhere to the principle of "simple, safe and wonderful" in organising the Games, making full use of existing venues and the soon-to-be-completed Kai Tak Sports Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sports minister Kevin Yeung said the Kai Tak Sports Park will host the handball, rugby sevens and fencing competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the other events, triathlon will take place at the Central Harbourfront; basketball at the Hong Kong Coliseum; track cycling in the Tseung Kwan O Velodrome; beach volleyball at Victoria Park; and golf at the Fanling Golf Course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG) will take place between December 8 and 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong will host boccia, wheelchair fencing and para table tennis (TT11) under the NGD and table tennis under the NSOG, along with a mass participation event Para Dance Sport.

    Overall inflation in China slows in March

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer price index (CPI), a main gauge of inflation, edged up 0.1 percent year on year in March, official data showed on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That was below the 0.4 percent gain forecast by a Bloomberg poll of analysts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a monthly basis, the nation's CPI went down 1 percent in March, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The core CPI, deducting food and energy prices, went up 0.6 percent year on year last month, maintaining a mild increase, according to the NBS.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure represented a slower rate of growth from 0.7 percent in February when consumer prices emphatically bucked a deflationary trend stretching back to August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In March, under the impact of factors such as the seasonal decline in consumer demand after the holidays and the overall sufficient market supply, the increase in the nationwide CPI... somewhat declined," the NBS said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slowdown "indicates that China still faces the risk of deflation, as domestic demand remains weak", said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese pianist Lang Lang was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles on Wednesday, in the category of live performance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lang is the first Asian pianist who has received a star on the iconic sidewalk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Internationally renowned pianist Lang Lang has sold millions of albums worldwide, topping classical charts and achieving simultaneous mainstream success," said Steve Nissen, President and CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the most influential classical musicians in the entire world, Lang Lang has over 20 million social media followers," said Nissen, adding that everything the pianist does is underpinned by his belief that "music makes life better - it heals, unites and inspires, and it makes us better people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is proud to recognize Lang Lang's outstanding contributions to the world of classical music and celebrate his extraordinary talent with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame." Ana Martinez, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lang recalled his upbringing and memories of Los Angeles, saying that music is the common ground for people from different cultural backgrounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Music is an important part of the cultural exchanges between China and the United States, the pianist told Xinhua. He hopes that more musicians and artists from China can serve as cultural bridges in the future and bring the elegance of Chinese culture to Western audiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The world communicates through music," Lang said, adding that he hopes to inspire as many people as possible to learn a musical instrument. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Former Kuomintang leader Ma Ying-jeou met President Xi Jinping, in his capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party, in Beijing on Wednesday, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi praised Ma for supporting the one-China principle and the 1992 consensus governing cross-strait relations, and his opposition to "Taiwan independence".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, for his part, said people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should avoid conflict or confrontation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair last met in Singapore in November 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ma, a former Taiwan leader, is on an 11-day visit to the mainland, his second in as many years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Wednesday, a spokeswoman of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Zhu Fenglian, praised Ma's efforts in promoting cross-strait youth exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also stressed the need for the peaceful development of ties across the Taiwan Strait.

    China says Fitch downgrade 'regrettable'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Finance on Wednesday said Fitch's downgrade of Chinese credit outlook was "regrettable" after the ratings agency announced the change earlier that day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "It is regrettable to see Fitch downgrade its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating," the finance ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From the results, it can be seen that the indicator system of Fitch's sovereign credit rating methodology has failed to effectively and proactively reflect Beijing's efforts to promote economic growth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded China's sovereign credit outlook to negative, citing increased risks to the country's public finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The "outlook revision reflects increasing risks to China's public finance outlook as the country contends with more uncertain economic prospects," Fitch said in a press statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Fitch affirmed China's credit rating at "A+", a move it said reflected the country's "large and diversified economy, still solid GDP growth prospects relative to peers, integral role in global goods trade, robust external finances, and reserve currency status of the yuan". (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Popular video games including "World of Warcraft" will return to China this summer, US developer Blizzard and local partner NetEase said on Wednesday, over a year after a contract dispute pulled them from the market leaving millions of fans bereft.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Beloved video game titles from Blizzard Entertainment that captivated millions of players in China will return to the market sequentially, beginning this summer, under a renewed publishing deal," the companies said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that titles including WoW spin-off card game "Hearthstone" and other games in the "World of Warcraft" (WoW) and "Overwatch" franchises would also return to the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WoW's Chinese servers went offline in January 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Massively popular worldwide, particularly in the 2000s, WoW is an online multiplayer role-playing game set in a fantasy Medieval world where good battles evil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is known for its immersive and addictive gameplay, and players can rack up hundreds of hours of game time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blizzard's games launched in China in 2008, through collaboration with internet giant NetEase -- under local law, foreign developers are required to partner with Chinese firms to enter the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after 14 years and acquiring millions of players in China, the two firms announced in November 2022 that talks over renewing their operating contract had failed to lead to an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After continuing discussions over the past year, both Blizzard Entertainment and NetEase are thrilled to align on a path forward to once again support players in mainland China and are proud to reaffirm their commitment to delivering exceptional gaming experiences," the companies said in their statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing would "strengthen strategic cooperation" with Moscow, as he met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in the capital for talks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lavrov also met President Xi Jinping on Tuesday as part of his two-day official visit to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lavrov arrived in Beijing earlier, with the two countries looking to further solidify diplomatic ties as Russia's war in Ukraine grinds on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In meetings on Tuesday, Wang promised "China will support Russia's stable development under the leadership of [Vladimir] Putin," according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair also pledged that Beijing and Moscow would continue their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, including through multilateral mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The promise came after last month's deadly attack in Moscow left more than 130 people dead, an atrocity which was blamed on the Islamic State terror group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said they discussed the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign Minister Lavrov and I had an in-depth communication about several international and regional hotspot issues... including the Ukraine and Palestine-Israel conflicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to emphasise that as a responsible major power, China always decides its own positions independently based on the individual rights and wrongs of each situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, as a force for peace and stability, China will stick to playing a constructive role on the international stage... and will never add oil to the flames," Wang said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will travel to China on Saturday for a three-day visit that will include talks with President Xi Jinping.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scholz will meet Xi and Premier Li Qiang in Beijing at the end of his trip on April 16, the chancellor's spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said at a press conference on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The German chancellor will also travel to the central city of Chongqing on Sunday, before heading to Shanghai on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Along the way, Scholz will hold talks with German business executives and give a speech at a university in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will be accompanied by a trio of cabinet ministers and a German industrial delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit to China is Scholz's second since he became chancellor, with the first in November 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz has insisted there will be no "decoupling" from its biggest trading partner, but Germany has also been cautiously nurturing relationships with other countries in Southeast Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as trade issues, the war in Ukraine will also be on the agenda during the talks with Xi. "I think China has influence on Russia and our wish would be for China to be able to exercise the influence it has," Hebestreit said. (AFP)

    China pushes back at US overcapacity concerns

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Monday dismissed as "groundless" US concerns that a surge of low-cost Chinese exports posed a risk to global markets, as Washington's treasury chief Janet Yellen wrapped up her China visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a trip to Paris, Wang said that "the accusations of 'overcapacity' by the United States and Europe are groundless".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency reported that Wang had pointed out that Beijing would support businesses in defending their interests, and that authorities have repeatedly dismissed concerns over so-called vast state support for industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The comments came as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has wrapped up high-level talks in China, said that Americans would not accept a situation where underpriced Chinese goods flood the global market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen also said she had raised concerns about China's weak domestic demand and over-investment in industries such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar products, fueled by what she described as "large-scale government support".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang had said Chinese electric vehicle makers' rapid growth was due to innovation and established supply chains, not subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, bilateral ties have stabilised with both sides willing to cooperate on issues including climate change, debt restructuring, and anti-money laundering. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in China for an official visit on Monday, his ministry said, as the two countries look to strengthen diplomatic ties as Russia's military offensive in Ukraine grinds on.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It announced Lavrov had touched down in Beijing in a post on X on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will spend two days in the capital and hold meetings with his counterpart Wang Yi, according to a previous readout from the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "An in-depth exchange of points of view is expected on a certain number of 'burning subjects'," the statement said, citing "the Ukrainian crisis and the situation in the Asia-Pacific region".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added they would "discuss a wide range of questions linked to bilateral cooperation, as well as cooperation on the international scene".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lavrov last visited Beijing in October for an international forum on President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang expressed hope on Sunday that the United States and China can be "partners, not adversaries", addressing US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at the start of a bilateral meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Noting that Chinese internet users have closely followed Yellen's visit since her arrival in Guangzhou this week, Li said this shows "expectation and hope for the China-US relationship to continue to improve".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Sunday, Yellen told Li that the ability to have difficult conversations has put the two economic superpowers on "a more stable footing" over the past year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen added that the two countries had a "duty" to responsibly manage a complex relationship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we have more to do, I believe that, over the past year, we have put our bilateral relationship on more stable footing," Yellen said in prepared remarks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This has not meant ignoring our differences or avoiding tough conversations. It has meant understanding that we can only make progress if we directly and openly communicate with one another."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Saturday in Guangzhou, Vice Premier He Lifeng and Yellen agreed to launch a new dialogue focused on "balanced growth", a forum that Yellen said she intends to use to advocate for a level playing field with China to protect US workers and businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a further sign of stabilising ties, President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden sought to manage tensions over the South China Sea in a nearly two-hour call on Tuesday, their first direct talks since a summit in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And military officials from both countries met last week for a series of rare meetings in Hawaii focused on operational safety and professionalism. (AFP/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Vice-Premier He Lifeng held "candid, pragmatic and constructive" discussions with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the official news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday, as the pair wrapped up two days of talks in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xinhua said the two officials agreed that a working group would further discuss issues such as the balanced growth of the Chinese, US and world economies, as well as financial stability, sustainable finance, and cooperation in countering money-laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Chinese side expressed grave concern over US economic and trade measures restricting China and responded fully to the issue of production capacity,” it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen had said ahead of her visit that her top priority was addressing what she said was excessive Chinese production capacity in fields such as electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy technology. State media had described her comments as a pretext for protectionist US policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement released after the talks, Yellen said the exchanges "will facilitate a discussion around macroeconomic imbalances, including their connection to overcapacity, and I intend to use the opportunity to advocate for a level playing field for American workers and firms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She characterised the discussions as productive and frank, and said capacity issues had been discussed for two hours.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two more people have been found dead in eastern Taiwan, raising to 12 the number of fatalities in the strongest earthquake to hit the island in 25 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities on Friday discovered two bodies on a hiking trail in quake-ravaged Hualien County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers also found more survivors, including nine from a winding cave known as the Tunnel of Nine Turns, which is popular with tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than a dozen people were still unaccounted for and about 700 others were trapped, with roads blocked off by landslides and rockfalls in the quake-hit areas, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of aftershocks have been reported since Wednesday's 7.3-magnitude tremor that left more than 1,000 injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And authorities on Friday began tearing down the Tien Wang Hsing, or Uranus, Building in Hualien City, which tilted at a 45-degree angle after the quake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Demolition work is expected to last about a week. (Agencies)

    Yellen meets business leaders in Guangzhou

Yellen meets business leaders in Guangzhou

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday called for a level playing field between American and Chinese companies, telling officials during a visit to Guangzhou that Beijing's industrial subsidies threatened that balance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing has dismissed those concerns, last month condemning a European Union probe into its subsidies for electric vehicles as protectionism and part of a Western effort to politicise international trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen said at the start of a meeting with Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong that she will emphasise the need for a level playing field for American workers and firms, and that Beijing and Washington must maintain open and direct communication on areas where they disagree.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This includes the issue of China's industrial capacity, which the United States and other countries are concerned can cause global spillovers," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has pushed back against over-capacity concerns expressed by both the US and Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While it is just basic economics that surplus products naturally seek out markets elsewhere once domestic demand is met, and Western nations have been doing that for centuries, when it comes to China, it becomes an 'overcapacity problem' threatening the world," the China Daily said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen on Friday will also meet with international business leaders in Guangzhou and participate in an American Chamber of Commerce event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She'll meet with Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier He Lifeng during her second visit to China in less than a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen's trip came after a phone conversation between Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden this week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is also expected to visit China in the coming weeks as bilateral ties stabilise. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities in Taiwan say the death toll from Wednesday's powerful earthquake rose to 10 on Thursday, after a body was found on a hiking trail at a nature reserve in Hualien County.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But most of the roughly 50 hotel workers, marooned on a highway as they headed to a resort in the park, have been located. Authorities also said 660 people remain trapped, most of them in hotels in the park, after a road was cut off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six miners, trapped on a cliff near Hualien, were also ferried to safety by a helicopter in a dramatic rescue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All those trapped in buildings in the worst-hit city of Hualien have been rescued, but many residents unnerved by more than 300 aftershocks spent the night outdoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aftershocks were terrifying," said Yu, a 52-year-old woman, who gave only her family name. "It's non-stop. I do not dare to sleep in the house."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Too scared to return to her apartment, which she described as being in a "mess", she slept in a tent on a sports ground being used for temporary shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of residents queued outside one badly damaged 10-storey building, waiting to go in and retrieve belongings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each was given 10 minutes to collect valuables in huge garbage bags, though some saved time by throwing items out of windows into the street below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This building is no longer liveable," said Tian Liang-si, who lived on the fifth floor, as she scrambled to gather her laptop, family photographs and other crucial items.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She recalled the moment the quake struck, sending the building lurching and furniture sliding, while she rushed to save the four puppies she keeps as pets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm a Hualien native," she told Reuters. "I'm not supposed to fear earthquakes. But this is an earthquake that frightened us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quake, measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by the China Earthquake Networks Center, struck in waters off the island's east coast, near the city of Hualien.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the strongest quake to hit the island in 25 years. Authorities put the tally of those injured at 1,067. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese contractor has resumed construction on a major dam site in northwestern Pakistan after being provided with extra security, officials said on Wednesday, following a deadly attack on Chinese engineers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Power China and the China Gezhouba Group Company had halted work on a pair of dam projects last month in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after a suicide bomber killed five Chinese nationals and a Pakistani driver, causing their van to plunge into a deep ravine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of Chinese people are employed at the Dasu and Diamer Bhasha dam construction sites, located around 100 kilometres apart in the mountainous region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Power China resumed work on the Diamer Bhasha dam on Monday after security was "significantly increased", Nazakat Hussain, a spokesman for the project, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pakistani police have detained more than 12 people, including Afghan nationals, in connection with the bombing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Chinese workers earlier this week, vowing to put in place "foolproof" security arrangements and promising "exemplary punishment" of attackers. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit China from April 4-9, the Finance Ministry said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This is Yellen's second trip to China in less than a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the US Treasury Department, her visit will begin in Guangzhou where she will meet with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Guangdong governor Wang Weizhong, and speak with representatives of US firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She'll then head to Beijing for talks with Premier Li Qiang, Finance Minister Lan Fo'an and central bank governor Pan Gongsheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yellen's visit came after Presidents Xi Jinping and Joe Biden spoke on the phone this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said while China-US relations were beginning to stabilise, both countries need to pay attention to “negative factors” and avoid sliding into conflict or confrontation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The China Daily wrote in a recent editorial that Yellen is known for her "often pragmatic and relatively positive tone" in managing bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Contrasting Yellen with "anti-China hawks in Washington," the report said she is well-suited for a "bridging role" as she has built trust with counterparts. (AFP & Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescuers are working to reach people trapped in rubble or tunnels after a powerful earthquake damaged dozens of buildings, destroyed roads and prompted tsunami warnings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people were killed and more than 1,000 injured by the quake which struck early on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of people were believed safe but unreachable in areas cut off by massive landslides triggered by the quake -- many in tunnels that cut through the mountains that bisect the island from north to south.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the quake was the strongest to shake the island in decades, and warned of more tremors in the days ahead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strict building regulations and widespread public disaster awareness appear to have staved off a major catastrophe for the earthquake-prone island, which lies near the junction of two tectonic plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were very lucky," said a woman surnamed Chang, who lived next door to a printing press warehouse near the capital that virtually pancaked in the quake, but all 50 inside at the time were plucked to safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many of the decorations at home fell on the floor, but people were safe."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu Chien-fu, director of Taipei's Central Weather Administration's Seismology Center, said the quake was the strongest since one of 7.6-magnitude struck in September 1999, killing around 2,400 people in the deadliest natural disaster in the island's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wednesday's magnitude-7.4 quake hit just before 8:00am Hong Kong time, with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) putting the epicentre 18 kilometres south of Taiwan's Hualien City, at a depth of 34.8 kilometres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three people among a group of seven on an early-morning hike through the hills that surround the city were crushed to death by boulders loosened by the earthquake, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, three died while driving when their vehicles were hit by tumbling rocks, while another died at a mine quarry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Fire Agency said all the fatalities had been in Hualien county, adding that 1,011 people across Taiwan had sustained injuries without specifying how seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media was awash with shared video and images from around the island of buildings swaying as the quake struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was shaking violently, the paintings on the wall, my TV and liquor cabinet fell," one man in Hualien told broadcaster SET TV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dramatic images were shown on local TV of multi-storey structures in Hualien and elsewhere tilting after the quake ended, while a printing warehouse in New Taipei City crumbled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mayor there said more than 50 survivors had been successfully plucked from the ruins of the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Local TV channels showed bulldozers clearing rocks along the main route to Hualien, a mountain-ringed coastal county of around 300,000 people that has been cut off by landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The major roads leading to Hualien's main city pass through an extensive series of strongly built tunnels -- some of them kilometres long -- and officials said dozens of people could be trapped in vehicles inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dozens of miners were also out of reach at a quarry in Hualien.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must carefully check how many people are trapped and we must rescue them quickly," president-elect and current Vice-President Lai Ching-te told reporters in Hualien.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By nightfall, the county was still experiencing rolling aftershocks as rescuers continued combing through debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Taiwan's capital, the famed Taipei 101 commercial building lit up to memorialise the victims of the quake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Taiwan, Japan and the Philippines, authorities initially issued tsunami warnings but by around 10;00am, officials said the threat had "largely passed". (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Xinping has held his first conversation with President Joe Biden since a summit in November. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1747270_2_L_20240403015101.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Joe Biden in a phone call on Tuesday that while Sino-US ties are beginning to stabilise, both sides also need to pay attention to “negative factors” that have been growing in the relationship, according to Xinhua News Agency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It quoted the president as saying that measures by Washington to “suppress China's trade and technology development, are not ‘de-risking,’ but creating risks.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua said while President Xi said China’s door will always be open if the US is willing to seek mutually beneficial cooperation, “if it is adamant on containing China's high-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, China is not going to sit back and watch.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua also quoted Xi as saying that China and the United States should not cut ties or turn their back on each other, much less slide into conflict or confrontation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the president stressed the need for both sides to strengthen dialogue in a mutually respectful way, manage differences prudently, advance cooperation, and step up coordination on international affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua also said Xi stated that the Taiwan issue is a “red line” that must not be crossed, and that China would not “sit on its hands” in the face of separatist activities and external support for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A readout from the White House said Biden had in turn emphasised the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, while characterising the talks as “candid and constructive”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The press release also said the leaders exchanged views on issues ranging from counternarcotics cooperation to climate change and military-to-military communication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that both sides welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open channels of communication and manage their relationship through high-level diplomacy and working-level consultation, including during upcoming visits by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was the first conversation between the two leaders since a historic in-person summit in California in November.

    Israel pledges probe into food charity raid deaths

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Relatives and friends mourn the death of Saif Abu Taha, a World Central Kitchen staff member killed in an Israeli airstrike. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1747257_1_L_20240402222646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday an airstrike that killed seven people working for celebrity chef Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity in Gaza was unintended and "tragic", and the military pledged an independent inquiry.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military confirmed the deadly strike on a WCK convoy that killed citizens from Australia, Britain and Poland as well as Palestinians and a dual citizen of the United States and Canada.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WCK said they were travelling in two armoured cars emblazoned with the charity's logo and another vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The military expressed "sincere sorrow" and promised an independent investigation into the incident, which drew widespread condemnation and ratcheted up pressure for steps to ease the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unfortunately in the past day there was a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants in the Gaza Strip," Netanyahu said in a video statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This happens in war. We are conducting a thorough inquiry and are in contact with the governments. We will do everything to prevent a recurrence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has long denied accusations that it is hindering the distribution of urgently needed food aid in Gaza, which it has besieged in a war since October, saying the problem is caused by international aid groups' inability to get it to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite coordinating movements with the Israeli military, the convoy was hit as it was leaving its Deir al-Balah warehouse after unloading more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza by sea, WCK said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war," said Erin Gore, chief executive of WCK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is unforgivable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Israeli military said it was conducting a thorough review at the highest levels to understand the circumstances of what it called a tragic incident, and pledged an investigation by "an independent, professional and expert body".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has been under rising international pressure to alleviate the severe hunger in Gaza, which has been devastated by months of fighting the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Much of the densely populated territory has been laid waste and most of its 2.3 million population displaced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Andres, who started WCK in 2010 by sending cooks and food to Haiti after an earthquake, said he was heartbroken and grieving for the families and friends of those who died in the airstrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing. It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WCK, which said last month it had served more than 42 million meals in Gaza over 175 days, announced it was pausing its operations in the region immediately and would make decisions soon about the future of its work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, Australia and Poland, countries which have generally been friendly towards Israel, all demanded action to protect aid workers, underlining Netanyahu's increasing diplomatic isolation over the situation in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed the death of 44-year-old aid worker Lalzawmi "Zomi" Frankcom and said his government had contacted Israel to demand those responsible be held accountable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland, which also lost a citizen, objected to the "disregard for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, including humanitarian workers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also condemned the killing of aid workers in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said civilians should never be the target of attacks, and that Beijing supports an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video obtained by Reuters showed a large hole in the roof of a four-wheel-drive WCK vehicle and its burned and torn interior, as well as paramedics moving bodies into a hospital and displaying the passports of three of those killed. (Reuters, additional reporting by RTHK)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping held talks with President-elect of the Republic of Indonesia and Great Indonesia Movement Party General Chairman Prabowo Subianto, who is on a visit to China, in Beijing on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi congratulated Prabowo on winning the election and asked Prabowo to relay sincere greetings and best wishes to President Joko Widodo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the rapidly developing and fruitful bilateral ties over the past decade under the guidance of the two heads of state, Xi said both sides have made Jakarta-Bandung High-speed Railway an exemplar of high-quality bilateral cooperation and entered a new stage of building a community with a shared future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China views its relations with Indonesia from a strategic and long-term perspective, and is willing to deepen all-round strategic cooperation with Indonesia, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China will work with Indonesia to build a China-Indonesia community with a shared future that has regional and global influence, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and contribute to regional and world peace, stability and prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo conveyed President Joko Widodo's sincere greetings to Xi, and said he is delighted to make China the first country he visits after being elected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Prabowo said he supports the development of a closer relationship with China and will continue the country's friendly policy towards China. (Xinhua)

Wang Yi cautions Europe over 'de-risking' strategy

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday said China would import even more high-quality products and services from France and believes the European country would provide a fair business environment for Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a joint press event with his French counterpart, Stephane Sejourne, Wang also said China hoped that de-risking was not targeted at specific countries and should not violate WTO rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "De-coupling with China is the biggest risk," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Europe has been pursuing a de-risking strategy and reducing dependency on China to retain its industrial edge and competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sejourne said France wanted "China to send very clear messages to Russia" over its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are convinced that there will be no lasting peace if it is not negotiated with the Ukrainians," speaking alongside Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will be no security for Europeans if there is no peace in accordance with international law," the French Foreign Minister continued.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And China, he said, could play a "key role" in ensuring respect for international law was maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sejourne's visit is the second to China by a French foreign minister in less than six months, following a trip by his predecessor, Catherine Colonna, in November. (Reuters/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 More than 70 Hong Kong students and teachers on Friday started a national education study tour in Beijing, aimed at giving participants a better understanding of the country and to heighten their awareness of national security.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government said the many of the participating students had made outstanding achievements in a territory-wide inter-school competition on national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group is being led by Education Secretary Christine Choi, who said in a statement that she hopes that the experience will help students develop “correct national, historical, ethnic and cultural perspectives, foster their patriotic sentiments and increase their awareness of the responsibility to safeguard national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said besides the capital, the group will also visit Shanghai and Hangzhou, and will learn about the national political system, cultural innovation, as well as the country’s historical and cultural heritage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, greeted the study tour in Beijing as an opening ceremony was held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said Choi also met officials of the Ministry of Education and visited Beijing Normal University to exchange views on recent education developments. She’ll next head to Shaanxi, where she’ll lead a delegation of Chinese history teachers on a study tour to the city of Yan'an.

    Huawei sees revenue and profit rebound in 2023

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tech giant Huawei more than doubled its profits last year as it recovers from tough US sanctions. File photo: AP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1746851_1_L_20240329184314.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Huawei Technologies on Friday said it saw its fastest growth in four years in 2023, with a rebound in its consumer segment and income from new businesses like smart car components.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-based company reported a net profit of 87 billion yuan, helped by strong sales and an improved product portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Revenue rose nearly 10 percent from a year earlier to 704.2 billion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei’s rotating chairman Ken Hu said the company’s figures were in line with forecasts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’ve been through a lot over the past few years. But through one challenge after another, we’ve managed to grow,” Hu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While Huawei did not break down the consumer figures, the segment includes its handset business, which saw a resurgence last year as the company returned to the mainstream 5G smartphone market with the Mate 60, apparently overcoming US restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington had been restricting Huawei's access to US technology since 2019, accusing the company of being a security risk, which Huawei denies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year marked the third consecutive year of growth for Huawei after revenue plummeted by almost a third in 2021 when the company started to exhaust chip reserves, though revenue remains below its 2020 peak of 891.3 billion yuan. (Reuters/AP)
