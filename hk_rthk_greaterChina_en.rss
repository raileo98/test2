  <div class="itemFullText">
   Central government leaders have pledged to deploy "necessary fiscal spending" to meet this year's economic growth target.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a Politburo meeting on Thursday chaired by President Xi Jinping, they also vowed to revitalise the property sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to Xinhua News Agency, the meeting was held "to analyse and study the current economic situation and make further arrangements for economic work".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is necessary to take a comprehensive, objective and calm view of the current economic situation, face the difficulties squarely and remain confident," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Politburo agreed that new economic problems demanded a "sense of responsibility and urgency" as Beijing seeks to achieve the 2024 GDP growth target of about 5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The country should effectively implement existing policies, step up efforts to roll out incremental policies, further make policy measures more targeted and effective, and strive to accomplish the targets and tasks for this year's economic and social development," according to the meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Leaders also said they would take measures to boost the property sector.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We must respond to the people's concerns, adjust housing purchase restriction policies, lower interest rates on existing mortgage loans... and promote the construction of a new model for real estate development," Xinhua said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China announced a series of measures, including cuts in mortgage rates and lowering the amount of cash banks have to keep in reserve, to help spur the world's second-largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The stimulus measures represent a "shift towards a more aggressive easing stance, given the sustained weakness in domestic growth", said Zhu Chaoping, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   And the Politburo's endorsement of further stimulus "represents a strategic shift in macro policy, from piecemeal policies to a highly orchestrated package in the right direction," said Bruce Pang, chief economist China at Jones Lang LaSalle. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The central government on Friday cut the amount banks must hold in reserve, a bid to boost its economy by releasing an estimated US$142.6 billion in liquidity into the financial market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing has this week unveiled a raft of measures to boost its economy, which it has targeted to grow five percent this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Thursday, the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of its top body, the Politburo, to "analyse and study the current economic situation".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing on Friday also cut the seven-day reverse repo rate, the short-term interest paid by the central bank on loans from commercial lenders.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The central bank announced it cut the key rate from 1.7 percent to 1.5 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Growth in China is being dragged down by a prolonged debt crisis in the property sector, sluggish domestic consumption and high youth unemployment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Some new situations and problems have emerged in the current running of the economy," the Xinhua news agency reported after Thursday's Politburo meeting.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We must view the current economic situation comprehensively, objectively and calmly, face difficulties squarely, (and) strengthen confidence," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Politburo members also agreed on the need to "further improve the focus and effectiveness of policy measures" aimed at lifting the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The raft of measures unveiled by Beijing, including key rate cuts and policies intended to encourage home purchases, have been welcomed by investors, with stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong up more than nine percent so far this week. (AFP)

      CUHK says satellite will predict floods, landslides

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Chinese University researchers on Monday said the first ever satellite funded by the government’s Innovation and Technology Commission is ready to help predict natural disasters in the territory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A team from CUHK helped develop the Hong Kong Youth Science and Technology Innovation Satellite which was put together on the mainland and launched into orbit last Tuesday from a sea platform off the coast of Haiyang, Shandong province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Equipped with remote sensing cameras, the satellite will be used to take detailed images of Earth, with a focus on the environmental and geographic information of Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The satellite is also the first in the world to be integrated with an AI model, allowing crucial data to be processed onboard rather than relying on transmission to ground stations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Professor Kwan Mei-po, the director of CUHK’s Institute of Space and Earth Information Science, said the satellite can operate for three to five years, adding that data collected will be fed to government agencies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We'll share with the Civil Engineering and Development Department with the data. But more importantly, this is not just the data, but also the modelling, AI, machine learning models, that we will try to help with the landslide control and also disaster management. We’ll also share with the observatory,” she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Professor Ma Peifeng, who’s part of the team, said the satellite will provide more accurate predictions of floods and landslides.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “We can improve the prediction accuracy because we can know the accurate location of the disasters. Generally speaking, the accuracy can be higher than 85 percent,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The university’s vice chancellor, Rocky Tuan, thanked the China National Space Administration for its guidance, saying the project lays the groundwork for better disaster response, not only in Hong Kong but worldwide.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The research team said this project is just the initial phase of a much larger initiative involving numerous satellite launches, with the next one expected in 2025.

   Top leaders including Premier Li Qiang and National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji, along with about 3,000 Chinese and foreign guests, attended the event.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi paid tribute to the people of all ethnic groups in China as well as officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police Force, among others, and extended greetings to the people of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, along with overseas Chinese.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said the central task of the party and the nation is to build China into a strong country and achieving national rejuvenation on all fronts by pursuing Chinese modernisation.
   <br/>

   Advancing this unprecedented great cause steadily is the best way to celebrate the anniversary of the People's Republic of China, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi emphasised that to advance Chinese modernisation, it is imperative to always uphold the core role of the party in exercising overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides, unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, deepen reform across the board and expand opening up, uphold a people-centred approach, and remain committed to peaceful development.

   The China Manned Space Agency has unveiled plans to launch the Shenzhou-19 mission later this month, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new set of astronauts will travel to the country's space station and take over from the Shenzhou-18 crew, who have been in orbit for almost half a year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The trio of Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021, and teammates Li Cong and Li Guangsu, will wrap up their time in space shortly and return to Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "At present, the Chinese space station has entered the operation and development stage. I believe there will be more footprints of Chinese astronauts in space in the future," Ye said in a televised interview with CCTV on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another astronaut Li Guangsu said the team had carried out experiments on fish in space, and that the more than 90 projects planned for the mission had been progressing smoothly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li Cong, for his part, said the crew will prepare to welcome three other astronauts to the space station, to continue racing in "the relay of the Shenzhou family".

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The sole candidate in Macau's chief executive race, Sam Hou-fai, made the first community visit of his campaign on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sam met grassroots residents of Iao Hon, a densely populated area in the northern part of the SAR that is undergoing redevelopment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He talked to people in a park, had lunch with young people in the area's municipal market complex, and also spoke to stall keepers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There's not enough recreational space overall [for people] to move around. This has to be considered when you're planning the overall layout of the district for the future," Sam told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I also feel that traffic is congested in the area, and the pavements are rather narrow. There's also limited space to park cars and motorbikes, or even public transport vehicles. So we'll all have to think about ways to improve this."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The former top judge also said he wanted to learn more about prices and people's everyday lives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He said such visits help with his team's research and will enable better policy planning when he becomes CE.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Macau's 400-strong Election Committee is due to vote on Sam's appointment on October 13.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China on Wednesday called on the international community to prevent the situation in the Middle East from spiralling out of control, following the latest escalation the region.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese side calls on the international community, especially major influential powers, to truly play a constructive role and prevent the situation from further deteriorating," a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese side is deeply concerned about the turmoil in the Middle East," the online statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has vowed to make Iran "pay" for firing a barrage of missiles at its territory and warned on Wednesday it would launch an even bigger attack if it is targeted.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Iran launched its second direct attack on Israel in history on Tuesday, firing what it said were 200 missiles, including hypersonic weapons, that sent Israeli civilians into shelters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China said it "opposes any act that violates Lebanon's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity and opposes the intensification of conflicts".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hezbollah began low-intensity strikes on Israeli troops a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas staged the October 7 attack, which triggered Israel's devastating assault on Gaza.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese side believes that the failure to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza is the root cause of the current turmoil in the Middle East," according to the Foreign Ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "All parties should work for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible." (Xinhua/AFP)

   A fire at a hospital in southern Taiwan killed nine people on Thursday morning as the island was battered by a typhoon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Eight victims were confirmed dead after being taken away for treatment, and another was later found dead at the scene, according to the island's fire agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The fire occurred in Pingtung county as Typhoon Krathon made landfall, lashing the area with torrential rains and heavy winds while bringing parts of the island to a standstill.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The deaths were attributed to smoke that arose from a source still under investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dozens of other patients were evacuated and moved to shelters nearby.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Soldiers from a nearby base were mobilised to help medical workers and firefighters in the evacuation of patients and putting out the flames.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Krathon made landfall in the major port city of Kaohsiung, packing maximum sustained winds of 126 kilometres per hour near its centre, with gusts of 162 kilometres per hour, according to authorities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Two storm-related deaths were reported, with more than 120 others injured.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The slow-moving typhoon has doused eastern and southern parts of the island over the past five days, forcing thousands to evacuate from mountainous or low-lying areas.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Schools and government offices have been shut for two days and all flights within the island have been cancelled. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   European Union members face a pivotal vote on Friday on whether to impose tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles in the bloc's highest profile trade case, which risks retaliation from Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission, which oversees the bloc's trade policy, proposed final duties for the next five years to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies after a year-long anti-subsidy investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under EU rules, the Commission can impose the tariffs for the next five years unless a qualified majority of 15 EU countries representing 65 percent of the EU's population votes against the plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Reuters reported on Wednesday that France, Greece, Italy and Poland would vote in favour, enough to avert a blocking majority against tariffs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the absence of a qualified majority either way, the EU executive can adopt the tariffs. However, it could also submit an amended proposal if it wanted to secure greater backing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The region's top economy and major car producer, Germany, will vote against the introduction of tariffs, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters late on Thursday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   German carmakers, for which China represents almost a third of their sales, have been particularly vocal against tariffs. Volkswagen said they were "the wrong approach".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The economy minister in Spain, a previous tariff backer, also said in a letter to European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, seen by Reuters on Thursday, that instead of imposing tariffs, the EU should "keep negotiations open... beyond the binding vote" to strike a deal on prices as well as the relocation of battery production to the bloc.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had already said on a visit to China that the EU should reconsider its position.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some EU members are nervous about Beijing's response. In moves seen as a retaliation, Beijing this year launched its own probes into imports of EU brandy, dairy and pork products.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the EU's stance towards Beijing has hardened in the past five years, now viewing China as a potential partner in some issues, but also as a competitor and a systemic rival.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commission says China's spare production capacity of 3 million EVs per year, which needed to be exported, is twice the size of the EU market. Given 100 percent tariffs in the United States and Canada, the most obvious outlet for those EVs is Europe.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The EU executive has said it is willing to continue negotiating an alternative to tariffs with China and could re-examine a price undertaking - involving a minimum import price and typically a volume cap - having previously rejected those offered by Chinese companies.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   One option under negotiation is minimum import prices calculated using criteria such as the range, battery performance and length of the electric vehicle, along with whether it is two- or four-wheel drive, a source familiar with the matter said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The tariffs range from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for SAIC and other companies deemed not to have cooperated with the EU investigation. These tariffs are on top of the EU's standard 10 percent import duty for cars. (Reuters)

      EU greenlights new tariffs on Chinese EVs

  <div class="itemFullText">
   EU countries on Friday gave a definitive green light to hefty additional tariffs on electric cars (EVs) made in China, despite strong opposition led by Germany.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ten countries including France and Italy supported slapping tariffs of up to 35.3 percent, on top of the current 10 percent, EU diplomats said, while five including Germany and Hungary voted against and 12 abstained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission provisionally approved additional duties in June after an inquiry concluded that Beijing's state aid to auto manufacturers was unfair.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has slammed the new tariffs as "protectionist" and warned they would trigger a trade war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Brussels says it aims to protect European carmakers in a critical industry that provides jobs to around 14 million people across the EU.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Canada and the United States have in recent months imposed much higher tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric car imports.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned the EU was headed for an "economic cold war" if it placed tariffs on Chinese EVs.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   German auto giant Mercedes-Benz said the tariffs were a "mistake", urging the European Commission to delay their implementation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We are convinced that punitive tariffs worsen the competitiveness of an industry in the long term," the company said in a statement. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Commerce Ministry in Beijing has firmly opposed the European Union’s decision to impose punitive tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, describing the move as protectionist and a grave violation of World Trade Organisation regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement on Friday, the ministry added the tariffs disrupted the international trade order, and threatened the global effort to tackle climate change.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China has all along demonstrated the utmost sincerity to resolve the differences through dialogue. Since the end of June, the two sides have engaged in more than 10 discussions on the matter," a spokesman said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The imposition of tariffs will not solve matters, and instead “rattle and impede” the confidence and determination of Chinese enterprises to invest in Europe, he warned.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The spokesman once again urged the EU to return to the negotiating table, and vowed to take all necessary measures to defend the interests of Chinese firms.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   More than 200 Chinese citizens have been safely evacuated from Lebanon, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "These people, who have been evacuated in two batches, include three Hong Kong residents and one Taiwan compatriot," the ministry said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese Embassy in Lebanon remains firm in Lebanon and continues to assist Chinese citizens remaining there in taking security measures," it added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The move comes after conflict in the Middle East has intensified following Iran's missile strike on Israel on Tuesday and Israel's incursion into Lebanon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a South Korean military transport aircraft returned 97 citizens and family members from Lebanon, the foreign ministry there said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A KC-330 aircraft left Beirut on Friday afternoon with the evacuees, who include Lebanese family members, and arrived at a military airfield on the south of Seoul, the ministry added. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two Chinese nationals were killed in an explosion near the international airport of the southern Pakistani city of Karachi on Sunday night, according to the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, in what it described as a "terrorist attack".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In a statement emailed to journalists, separatist militant group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the explosion was an attack carried out by them using a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device targeting Chinese nationals, including engineers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan broadcaster Geo News reported at least 10 people were injured in the blast in addition to some fatalities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The nature of the blast was not immediately clear, Geo News cited a provincial official as saying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Chinese embassy said a convoy from the Port Qasim Electric Power Company was attacked near the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese Embassy and Consulates General in Pakistan strongly condemn this terrorist attack, express deep condolences to the innocent victims of both countries and sincere sympathies to the injured and (their) families," the statement said, adding the Chinese side was working with Pakistani authorities in the aftermath.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The embassy called for practical and effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions, and projects in Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan remind Chinese citizens and companies in Pakistan to be vigilant, pay close attention to the local security situation, strengthen security measures, and make every effort to take safety precautions."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The BLA seeks independence for the province of Balochistan, located in Pakistan's southwest and bordering on Afghanistan and Iran.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, it launched coordinated attacks in the province, in which more than 70 people were killed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   BLA specifically targets Chinese interests - in particular the strategic port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea, accusing Beijing of helping Islamabad exploit the province.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It has previously killed Chinese citizens working in the region and attacked China's consulate in Karachi. (Reuters/Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) says the central government was committed to supporting the development of Hong Kong and Macau, and more preferential policies for the two SARs were on the way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In an article published on Sunday, the HKMAO said Beijing had rolled out favourable policies according to the needs of Hong Kong and Macau, such as raising the duty-free shopping allowance and increasing the number of mainland cities for individual travel to Hong Kong and Macau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The office also noted the recent improvements in Hong Kong's international rankings in finance, business environment, and IPO fundraising, while Macau had retained its title of Asia's best convention city.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Hong Kong and Macau's 'golden signboards' are shining brighter, and their economies are increasingly 'coming alive' and 'heating up'," the HKMAO wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The HKMAO added the two SARs would continue to flourish by leveraging their high levels of internationalisation, market-oriented systems, and rule of law.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "With the strong backing of the great motherland, the compatriots of Hong Kong and Macau will certainly create a better future," the article read.

  <img alt="Economy-boosting stimulus measures from Beijing have sent mainland markets soaring. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773613_1_20241008094444.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland stocks soared more than 10 percent at the open on Tuesday as traders resumed a blistering rally after a week-long break hoping for more economy-boosting measures from Beijing, which unveiled a slew of stimulus last month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shanghai Composite Index surged 10.13 percent, or 337 points, to 3,674, to its highest point since mid-2022 while the Shenzhen Composite Index piled on 11.37 percent, or 219 points, to 2,146, its best level since December 2021.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before the break, China announced the most aggressive stimulus measures since the pandemic and the CSI300 gained 25 percent over five sessions. Turnover soared as heavy buying strained brokers and trading systems, and last Monday the CSI300 and the Shanghai Composite both notched their largest gains since 2008.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have cut rates and hinted at fiscal support to shore up an economy that, by Chinese standards, is ailing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before the Golden Week holiday break, hedge fund manager David Tepper said on CNBC the moves were encouraging enough that he would buy "everything" on China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But gains have been so large that others now urge caution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China's weighting in the MSCI EM Index rose from 24 percent in August to 30 percent now, and its continued out-performance may drive a self-reinforcing 'pain-trade' before the year-end," Bank of America analysts said in a note on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they said, the "'buy everything' stage will be over soon," with market momentum, fiscal support, earnings, the US election and further policy settings all part of the outlook.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Consumer, property (and) broker stocks could be profit-taking candidates ... big cap internet and high-yield SOEs are our preferred exposure," they said. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China was "fully confident" of achieving its full-year economic and social development targets, the chairman of the country's economic planner Zheng Shanjie said on Tuesday, adding some of 2025's budget would be issued this year to support projects.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A package of economic stimulus measures unveiled by authorities since late September sent Chinese shares soaring on Tuesday to two-year highs, extending a rally after markets reopened from a week-long National Day holiday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Investors and economists were expecting more policy support on the fiscal side to underpin the market's optimism.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's economy remains largely stable but is facing more complex internal and external environments, Zheng, chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told a press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The downward pressures on China's economy is also increasing with some industries seeing rat-race competition," Zheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   To support local governments, China will issue 100 billion yuan from next year's central government budget and another 100 billion yuan for key investment projects by the end of this year, Zheng said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The country will also quicken fiscal spending and "all sides should keep making efforts more forcefully" to strengthen macroeconomic policies, he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Zheng also said China would study new policies in a timely manner to promote steady growth, structural improvement and sustained development of the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The NDRC will "closely follow changes of the economic situation, evaluate the effects of policy implementation, and conduct preliminary research on more supportive policies and maintain policy options," said Zheng.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government set a growth target of around five percent this year, but economic indicators showed growth momentum waned since the second quarter.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China unveiled its most aggressive monetary stimulus package since the COVID-19 pandemic and a flurry of property market support in late September, a sign officials are becoming increasingly anxious and keen to reverse the economic downturn.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A vice NDRC chairman said at the same press conference that China's economic growth remained "generally stable" over the first three quarters. (Reuters/Xinhua)

      China to impose anti-dumping measures on EU brandy

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China has imposed temporary anti-dumping measures on brandy imports from the European Union (EU), hitting brands from Hennessy to Remy Martin.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday that an investigation has preliminarily determined that dumping of brandy, or the act of exporting goods to a foreign market at a low price, from the EU is threatening the nation's own brandy sector with "substantial damage".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It added that as of October 11, importers of brandy originating in the EU will have to put down security deposits, mostly ranging from 34.8 percent to 39 percent of the import value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   France, which supported tariffs on mainland-made electric vehicles (EVs), accounted for 99 percent of China's brandy imports last year, with brandy shipments from the country reaching US$1.7 billion.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hennessy and Remy Martin were among the brands worst-hit, with importers having to pay security deposits of 39 and 38.1 percent, respectively.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The measures came on the heels of the EU's move to adopt tariffs on China-made EVs by the end of October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In that decision, the bloc set tariff rates ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla to 35.3 percent for SAIC and other producers deemed not to have cooperated with the EU's anti-subsidy investigation. These will come on top of the EU's standard 10 percent car import duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing called the tariffs protectionist and a violation of World Trade Organisation regulations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission has said it's willing to continue negotiating an alternative, even after tariffs are imposed. (Reuters)

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Commerce Minister Wang Wentao has urged the United States to lift sanctions on Chinese firms as soon as possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang on Tuesday held a phone conversation with US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang "focused on expressing serious concerns about US semiconductor policy on China and its restrictions on China's network-connected cars", according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He "stressed that it is particularly necessary to clarify national security boundaries in economic and trade fields", the ministry said, adding that would allow for maintaining the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The commerce minister also called on Washington to pay attention to the concerns of Chinese enterprises and improve the business environment for Chinese firms in the US.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A statement released by the US Commerce Department said Raimondo had reiterated that US national security is "not negotiable".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She pointed to the US government's approach of being targeted with security policy "while leaving space for healthy trade and investment", the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Washington has raised tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries and solar cells, and is planning to ban the sale of connected vehicles incorporating Chinese and Russian technology, citing national security risks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wang also said China-US economic and trade ties should become the "ballast" in bilateral relations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The talks between the two commerce chiefs were described by Beijing as candid, in-depth and pragmatic, focusing on the implementation of the consensus reached between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in their meeting in San Francisco last year. (Xinhua/AFP)

      SAR, Commerce Ministry sign amendment to CEPA

  <img alt="Paul Chan (centre) says the CEPA amendment will make it easier for local professionals to tap into the mainland market.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Local enterprises and professionals will be able to access mainland markets more easily thanks to the latest amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He made the comment after the SAR government and the Ministry of Commerce signed an agreement to amend the CEPA framework on trade in services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The free trade agreement, first signed between the SAR and the mainland in 2003, allows qualifying Hong Kong companies and residents to enjoy preferential access to the mainland market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The changes, which will take effect from March 1 next year, include removing or loosening restrictions on business scope in setting up enterprises, and relaxing qualification requirements for professionals from certain sectors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm sure for the professional sectors, people are very keen to expand their foothold into the mainland by using the Greater Bay Area as the starting point. So this will be a very positive impact on Hong Kong," Chan told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the relaxation agreement, there are certain industries directly benefiting, including the testing and certification sector, telecommunications, filming, television, financial services, and tourism."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the amendment, local surveying enterprises will be allowed to provide services in Guangdong province through the filing of records, and Hong Kong telecom service suppliers can sell international phone cards which cannot be activated in the mainland across the border.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For tourism, the 144-hour visa-exemption policy for foreign tour groups entering Guangdong from Hong Kong will be optimised.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In banking, foreign bank branches set up by Hong Kong companies will be allowed to offer bank card services.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Asked about the recent fluctuations in the stock market, Chan said the financial market is affected by many factors including external interest rates, adding that investors should manage risks carefully.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner will face Daniil Medvedev in the Shanghai Masters quarter-finals after both had straight-set victories on Wednesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner put some old demons to rest in overcoming American Ben Shelton 6-4, 7-6 (7/1), while Medvedev took out Greece's Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shelton, ranked 16, knocked Sinner out at the same stage last year, but on Wednesday the Italian looked confident from the start as he won in 88 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The US Open champion pulled ahead in the ninth game of the first set, breaking when Shelton hit long, then dominated the second set tiebreak.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough, you don't have so much control when you play against him... I just tried to stay strong mentally," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   World number five Medvedev and Tsitsipas were meeting for the 14th time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Greek started the second set strongly, breaking in the first game, but Medvedev broke in the fourth and eighth to progress.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Medvedev and Sinner have met four times this year already in the final stages of tournaments.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner beat Medvedev in the semi-finals at Miami, the quarter-finals at the US Open and in the Australian Open final, but the Russian ended the Italian's hopes in the last eight at Wimbledon in an epic five-set battle.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm gonna bring the fight," said Medvedev.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I could have done much better in the US Open... I didn't explore enough my potential during this match. So I'm going to try to explore this potential tomorrow," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also through to the quarterfinals is world number two Carlos Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in the China Open final a week ago.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 21-year-old was facing off against veteran Gael Monfils, winning 6-4, 7-5 for a 12th straight victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 38-year-old Frenchman had upset Alcaraz at their last meeting in August at Cincinnati, and the Spaniard admitted that "was on his mind" during the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I'm just really, really happy I won the match, and that I stayed calm through the whole match," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Playing against Gael is never easy... You need to be focused on every ball," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in action on Wednesday are four-time Shanghai champion Novak Djokovic and world number three Alexander Zverev. (AFP)

      Central bank opens up 500bn yuan swap facility

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's central bank said on Thursday it would start accepting applications from financial institutions to join a newly created funding scheme, initially worth 500 billion yuan, to aid the capital market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can apply to join the swap scheme, which gives them easier access to funding to buy stocks.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC first announced the scheme on September 24 as part of a broad package of policies to stimulate the economy and boost capital markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the swap facility, eligible securities firms, fund companies and insurers can use their assets including bonds, stock ETFs and holdings in constituents of the CSI 300 Index as collateral in exchange for highly liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The initial scale of the swap program is set at 500 billion yuan, and can be expanded in the future.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The announcement came after mainland stocks tumbled on Wednesday following a blistering rally in response to one of Beijing’s most aggressive stimulus package in years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PBOC had slashed interest on one-year loans to financial institutions, cut the amount of cash lenders must keep on hand and pushed to lower rates on existing mortgages.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Several major cities – including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen – have also further eased restrictions on buying homes, and top officials including Premier Li Qiang have called for more effective implementation of the slate of measures.(Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China will resume imports of Australian lobster by year-end, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday, marking the end of a four-year diplomatic fight that saw tens of billions of dollars of Australian exports locked out of China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Albanese said he agreed on the timeline to resume full lobster trade by year end during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Laos.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This, of course, will be in time for Chinese New Year and this will be welcomed by the people engaged in the live lobster industry in places like Geraldton, and South Australia and Tasmania, and so many parts of particularly regional Australia," Albanese said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China first imposed unofficial bans and tariffs on Australian goods ranging from coal to wine and rock lobster in late 2020 after years of tensions that culminated in Canberra calling for an inquiry into the origins of COVID-19.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before Thursday's announcement, all the restrictions on bar lobster had been removed as relations between the major trading partners improved.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li said the progress reached on the issue showed that China-Australia relations were promising, as long as the two sides continued to work towards a common goal. (Reuters/Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned the leader of the Taiwan region, Lai Ching-te, saying he was trying to increase tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his political self interest.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular press briefing that Taiwan has "no so-called sovereignty", as it is part of China, and that Lai had sought to "deliberately sever" the historical connection between the two in a speech he gave earlier in the day.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It again exposed his stubborn stance of 'Taiwan independence' and sinister intention of increasing tensions in the Taiwan Strait to seek political gain," Mao said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   She added that Lai had used "all manner of tactics to peddle the fantasy of ‘Taiwan independence’".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lai had said the mainland has “no right” to represent Taiwan, but added that the island is willing to work with authorities in Beijing to combat challenges like climate change.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   President Xi Jinping on Friday met with foreign guests while attending the China International Friendship Conference and conference marking the 70th founding anniversary of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, in Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi had a group photo taken with the foreign guests and spoke highly of the long-term dedication of international friends to cementing friendship with China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He pointed out that people-to-people friendship is the foundation for stable and long-term international relations and an unremitting driving force for promoting world peace and development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Over the past 75 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China has united and led the Chinese people in blazing a path of modernization that has not only developed the country itself but also benefited the world," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Xi said that looking back on the journey, China's achievements in various fields would not have been realized without the support of people from other countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Numerous foreign enterprises, institutions and individuals have actively participated in advancing China's socialist modernization, thus achieving mutual benefits and making important contributions to promoting friendly exchanges and cooperation between China and other countries," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We will always remember your important contributions to China and the sincere friendship that has been developed with the Chinese people," Xi added. (Xinhua)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Hong Kong residents flocked to the mainland on Friday for the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend holiday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   RTHK spoke to some residents queuing for a bus to Heung Yuen Wai Control Point at Fanling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I will explore around Liantang, just to walk around, and I will return today," a man surnamed Wong said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Yip said she travels to Shenzhen every month.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I am going to Shenzhen to have fun, maybe I'll get hotpot. I'm heading there because it's a holiday today, and my mom is with me. I want to relax myself, because I always stay in Hong Kong. I want to go to other places and walk around."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Special transport arrangements were made to accommodate travellers. The transport department said the vehicle clearance plaza towards Zhuhai direction at Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge remained busy, and waiting times for the shuttle bus were extended.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The department reminded residents travelling to Zhuhai or Macau to plan ahead and allow more time for journeys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At West Kowloon station, announcements were made to remind the public to leave sufficient time to complete immigration procedures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Police earlier called on the public to make use of different ports to enter the mainland, as waiting times for cars to cross the border at Shenzhen Bay Port may exceed one hour.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   MTR said train services will be strengthened during the long weekend period, with waiting times shortened on the East Rail Line and Island Line.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   According to the Immigration Department, more than 570,000 people left the city on Thursday, which was more than 1.5 times the number the day before.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Among the people who made their departures, around 480,000 of them were Hong Kong residents.

  <img alt="Serbia’s Novak Djokovic celebrates winning against Czech Republic’s Jakub Mensik during their match at the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774140_1_20241011213250.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Novak Djokovic proved his staying power on Friday, beating an opponent 18 years his junior 6-7 (4/7), 6-1, 6-4 to claim the last spot in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 37-year-old's victory over the Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik came a day after one of his greatest rivals and contemporaries, Rafael Nadal, announced he would retire in November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Serb, who is aiming for a 100th singles title in Shanghai, will next face world number seven Taylor Fritz after the American beat Belgium's David Goffin 6-3, 6-4 earlier on Friday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Overall, big battle, it took the best out of me to win it," said Djokovic after the match.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both Djokovic and 65th-ranked Mensik brought serious firepower to the court, their hard-hitting rallies driving the stadium wild with tension.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The first set was closely fought, with Djokovic's break in the ninth game matched immediately by Mensik in the next.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The veteran pulled ahead early in the tiebreak, but seemed to lose focus, allowing the 19-year-old to come from behind to win.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 24-time Grand Slam champion dominated the second set though, breaking in the second and sixth game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Mensik recovered to pile on the pressure again in the third, but Djokovic got a crucial break in the fifth game to be crowned winner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Djokovic called his opponent "one of the best players we have on the tour".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "He's only 19 and he's already playing at such a high level, managing situations of high pressure so well for someone who doesn't have much experience," he said. "I think the future is very bright for him." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's finance minister said on Saturday that the country would "significantly increase" government debt issuance to offer subsidies to people with low incomes, support the property market and replenish state banks' capital as it pushes to lift economic growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Commercial banks are also moving separately to ease the burden on homeowners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Without providing details on the size of the fiscal stimulus being prepared, Finance Minister Lan Foan told a news briefing in Beijing that there will be more "counter-cyclical measures" this year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There is still relatively big room for China to issue debt,” he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lan noted that local governments still have a combined 2.3 trillion yuan to spend in the last three months of this year, including debt quotas and unused funds.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Local governments will be allowed to repurchase unused land from property developers, Lan said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Separately, China's major national commercial banks unveiled detailed measures to adjust interest rates for outstanding mortgage loans in line with the central bank's policies to stabilize the property market.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Major lenders - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank - said the adjustment would take effect from October 25.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They said the mortgage rates for first homes, second homes and more will be reduced to 30 basis points below the loan prime rate.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The People's Bank of China last month asked commercial banks to lower interest rates for outstanding mortgage loans as the country aims to ease property owners' financial burdens. (Xinhua, Reuters)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The annual return rate of the pension funds entrusted for investment by local governments in China has reached 5 percent since the end of 2016, according to a report released on Saturday by the National Council for Social Security Fund (NCSSF).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The local pension fund is part of the basic pension fund. The central government started market operation of the basic pension fund in December 2016, with the aim of preserving and increasing its value.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, the local pension funds managed by the NCSSF have earned an investment income of 306.67 billion yuan, achieving an average annual investment return rate of 5 percent, according to the report.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2023, investment income of the local pension funds amounted to 39.58 billion yuan, with an investment return rate of 2.42 percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report went on to say that the total assets of the basic pension funds had reached over 2.23 trillion yuan by the end of 2023. (CCTV)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   World number one Jannik Sinner reached the final of the Shanghai Masters after convincingly defeating the Czech Republic's Tomas Machac 6-4, 7-5 on Saturday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sinner will take on Novak Djokovic in the final, who fought through a knee problem to defeat Taylor Fritz 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) in an "incredible fight" on Saturday, setting up a blockbuster Shanghai Masters showdown.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 33rd-ranked Machac was looking to repeat his giant-slaying of Thursday, when he knocked out world number two Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The semi-final got off to an electric start when the Czech broke Sinner in the first game.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But the two-time Grand Slam champion kept his cool to break back in the fourth, then claimed the tenth game to clinch the set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the second set neither was able to break serve until the 12th game, when the Italian hit a winner to book his place in Sunday's final.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was very tough... he is playing with so much confidence and he can hit a ball really hard, and is serving very well," said Sinner.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I tried to stay there mentally... I'm very happy about how I'm fighting at the moment." (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka fought back from a set down to beat Coco Gauff 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday and reach the Wuhan Open final for the third time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A champion in Wuhan in 2018 and 2019, Sabalenka improved her perfect record in the tournament to 16-0.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gauff, who was on a nine-match winning streak on the back of her title run in Beijing last week, played a perfect first set but committed a whopping 21 double-faults during a semi-final lasting two hours, 26 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka has now won 19 of her last 20 matches, a stretch that includes titles in Cincinnati and at the US Open.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The atmosphere was incredible," said Sabalenka, who was 2-4 down in the second set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It definitely felt like one of the biggest matches of my career because the crowd made it feel like it was a Grand Slam final."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sabalenka struggled on serve early on and couldn't control her forehand as a clinical Gauff leapt to a double-break 5-0 lead inside 19 minutes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The American dropped a mere two points behind her first serve and limited the Belarusian to just two winners throughout that opening frame.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If the first set was a rout, the second was a dogfight with six of the first eight games going against serve.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After 78 minutes of play, Sabalenka found herself in the lead for the first time in the match, inching ahead 5-4 to up the pressure on Gauff, whose serve abandoned her when she needed it most.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Gauff's double-fault count rising, Sabalenka took full advantage and broke serve to level the contest and force a decider.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A marathon third game that witnessed seven deuces and three break points saw Sabalenka win a seventh consecutive game and hold for a 3-0 lead in the final set.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Despite Gauff's best retaliatory efforts to level for 4-4 Sabalenka held on to close out a gritty victory. (AFP)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   The Commerce Ministry said on Saturday that talks in Brussels over the European Union's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles have ended with "major differences" remaining.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last Friday, Brussels voted to impose additional new tariffs of up to 35.3 percent on imports of Chinese-made electric cars.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Representatives from Beijing and the 27-member bloc have held eight rounds of talks over the issue in Brussels since September 20.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "There are still major differences between the two sides," a ministry statement said, adding that it has invited EU negotiators for further discussions in China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Negotiators "made important progress in some areas," the statement said, but "have not reached a solution acceptable to both sides".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It is hoped that the EU can meet China halfway, arrange to come to China as soon as possible, and accelerate the consultations with a constructive attitude, so as to reach a proper solution as soon as possible," the statement said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier this month, China slapped provisional tariffs on EU-made brandy, alarming French producers. (Xinhua/AFP)

      Sam Hou-fai wins Macau's CE election

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Former Macau top judge Sam Hou-fai on Sunday won the SAR's Chief Executive election, receiving all but six votes from a 400-strong election committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Electoral authorities said there were four blank ballots cast, with no invalid votes. Two members were absent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sam, 62, is from Zhongshan in Guangdong, making him the first Macau leader born in mainland China. He graduated from Peking University's law school and moved to Macau in 1986.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE-elect described the victory as the highest honour of his life, saying he's humbled and excited. He added that he’s fully prepared to devote himself to serving the city that he "deeply loves".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Right now, Macau is welcoming the best period for development. Let's grasp the opportunities and meet the challenges, work hard together and reform. We strive for development and prosperity, and build our homes in a better way together," Sam said in his acceptance speech.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We contribute Macau's power for our national rejuvenation and the building of a strong nation... I stand here today, full of emotions. Because my life's path has always shared the same fate with the country, and Macau."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sam added that he will unswervingly uphold One Country, Two Systems; and safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests to promote a diversified economic development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The CE-elect, who's due to take office in December, had served as the chief judge at Macau's top court since the SAR was established in 1999. He resigned in August this year to run in the election.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The outgoing Chief Executive, Ho Iat-seng, announced in August that he wasn't seeking another term because his health "hadn't fully recovered".

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Beijing officials responsible for Macau affairs on Sunday offered their congratulations to the SAR's former top judge, Sam Hou-fai, on winning the Chief Executive race.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sam took 394 out of 400 votes from the Election Committee, with four blank votes and two members absent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said the result indicates that the Macau society widely recognises Sam's character, vision, ability and style.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The election process and result...are significant in the full implementation of the principle of 'patriots governing Macau', and further pushing forward the successful implementation of the One Country, Two Systems principle with Macau characteristics," the office said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Beijing's Liaison Office in Macau, meanwhile, noted that this was the first CE poll since amendments were made to the electoral laws in Macau.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It described the election as open, fair, impartial, legal, smooth and orderly.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee, also congratulated Sam for his victory.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He described the two SARs as core cities in the Greater Bay Area that serve as engines for regional development.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I have every confidence in working closely with Mr Sam in the future to achieve complementarity and mutual benefits for Hong Kong and [Macau], giving full play to the cities' strengths to serve the country's needs," Lee said in a statement.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   National and regional flags are being flown at half mast at key facilities across the country as the nation mourns the death last Tuesday of Wu Bangguo, former chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Wu, who passed away at the age of 84, is to be cremated in the capital Beijing on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Flags at Tiananmen Square, the Great Hall of the People, other government buildings, ports and facilities across the country – including in Hong Kong and Macau – as well as Chinese embassies and consulates, were flown at half-mast to mourn his passing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities have praised Wu in an obituary, calling him “an excellent Party member, a time-tested and loyal communist soldier and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman and leader of the Party and the state.”

      China holds military drills in Taiwan Strait

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China launched military drills near Taiwan on Monday, in what it said was a stern warning against the "separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Captain Li Xi, spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills, dubbed Joint Sword-2024B, "test the joint operations capabilities of the theater command's troops".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The command published a map showing nine areas around Taiwan where the drills were taking place – two on the island's east coast, three on the west coast, one to the north and three around smaller islands next to the mainland coast.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ships and aircraft are approaching Taiwan in "close proximity from different directions", focusing on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, blockading key ports and areas, assaulting maritime and ground targets and "joint seizure of comprehensive superiority", Li said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of 'Taiwan independence' forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The coast guard was also dispatched to conduct inspections around the island. A diagram released by the coast guard showed four fleets encircling Taiwan and moving in an anticlockwise direction around the island.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The drills come after Taiwan leader Lai Ching-te gave an speech last Thursday saying China had no right to represent the island, drawing condemnation from Beijing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since then, state media have run a series of stories and commentaries denouncing Lai's speech, and on Sunday the Eastern Theatre Command released a video saying it was "prepared for battle".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The PLA's Liberation Army Daily newspaper wrote on Monday that "those who play with fire get burned!".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "As long as the 'Taiwan independence' provocations continue, the PLA's actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop," the paper said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Taiwan’s mainland affairs council has condemned the drills as "blatant provocations" that it said seriously undermined regional peace and stability.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Authorities on the island also said “appropriate forces” have been dispatched. (Xinhua, agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Premier Li Qiang landed in the city on Monday ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li's visit is the first by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years, Pakistan's Prime Minister's Office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at the airport.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government has announced a three-day public holiday in Islamabad, with schools and businesses shut and large contingents of police and paramilitary forces deployed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan army troops will be responsible for the security of the capital's Red Zone, the location of the parliament and a diplomatic enclave and where most of the meetings will take place, according to the interior ministry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The threat alert has been high in the South Asian nation ahead of the SCO summit, especially after the killing of two Chinese engineers and shooting to death of 21 miners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tensions have mounted after jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan called for a protest on October 15 to press for his release and agitate against the coalition government, following violent clashes between his party loyalists and security forces.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Islamabad has sought to curb all movement of Chinese nationals in the city, citing fears they could be targets for violence from separatist militants.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The 23rd meeting of the SCO, which comprises nine full members including China, India, Iran and Russia, is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Islamabad.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As well as attending the SCO summit, Li is also undertaking a four-day bilateral visit to Pakistan from Monday to Thursday, accompanied by senior officials, Pakistan's foreign office said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead their respective delegations to discuss economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li will also inaugurate the CPEC funded Gwadar International Airport in restive southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, Pakistan's prime minister's office said.

      China's export growth slows sharply in September

  <div class="itemFullText">
   China's exports grew at the slowest pace in five months in September, suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from several trade partners and that global demand for Chinese goods is softening.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 2.4 percent year on year by value last month, customs data showed on Monday, missing a forecast of six percent increase by a poll of economists.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Exports rose 8.7 percent in August.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Imports edged up 0.3 percent, missing expectations for a 0.9 percent increase and in contrast to the previous figure of 0.5 percent growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's exports grew at their fastest pace in nearly 1.5 years in August, but economists cautioned that officials in the country should avoid becoming too reliant on global demand as they work to bolster overall growth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, officials in Beijing announced plans to ramp up debt issuance to aid local governments in managing their debt problems and provide increased support to low-income earners.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, they did not state the size of the fiscal stimulus at the highly anticipated news conference, disappointing markets.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts anticipate it will take a long time to restore consumer and business confidence and get the US$19 trillion economy on a more solid footing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A housing market recovery, in particular, could be a long way off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Last week, the head of China's state planner said he was "fully confident" of achieving the government's full-year growth target of around five percent.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Manufacturing activity shrank for a fifth straight month in September, with new export orders falling to their worst in seven months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Analysts have attributed previous months' strong export performance to factory owners slashing prices to find buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The European Commission last week saw its motion to impose additional duties on electric vehicles built in China of up to 45 percent pass in a divided vote of EU member states, joining the US and Canada in tightening trade measures against China.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China's overall trade surplus narrowed to US$81.71 billion in September from US$91.02 billion in August and missed a forecast of US$89.80 billion. (Reuters)

      Two pandas depart China for US capital

  <img alt="Giant Panda statues are seen at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774560_1_20241015110842.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Two giant pandas on Tuesday departed the mainland for a zoo in the US capital.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bao Li, a male panda, and female Qing Bao, both three years old, were headed to the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington under a decade-long breeding and research agreement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China and the United States have made orderly arrangements... to ensure that the two giant pandas will arrive at the Washington National Zoo safely and smoothly," the China Wildlife Conservation Association said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Lu Yongbin, party secretary of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda committee, said at the farewell ceremony in Sichuan that the new round of China-US cooperation will boost bilateral collaboration in endangered species and biodiversity protection and enhance the friendship between the Chinese and American people.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Bao Li and Qing Bao were accompanied by an experienced breeder and a veterinarian to help them adapt quickly to their new environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Only a few of the beloved black-and-white bears remain in the US after almost all were returned to China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts – including all three of the National Zoo's pandas last November.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   President Xi Jinping said after meeting his counterpart Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In August, San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to be sent by the nation to the US in 21 years.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Anticipation for the pandas' arrival in Washington was high, with the National Zoo's website emblazoned with a banner that read: "The pandas are coming."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Something "giant" is "coming to Washington", the zoo said in a post on X, adding that it would be closed on Tuesday but that for "the safety of the pandas and staff, we will not disclose any additional timing".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Preparations were well underway at the zoo, where pandas have been star attractions for decades. Renovations have been undertaken at the panda habitat "to enhance the safety of the facilities and maximise space for the bears to roam", according to the zoo's website.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The new structures constructed for the pandas include shallow pools to allow them to bathe and bamboo stands that require the bears to mimic the foraging techniques they would use in the wild.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The bears will not, however, be available to the public for more than a month after their arrival, as they will need to be quarantined and to acclimate to their new habitat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   While en route, the pandas' in-flight meals will include bamboo shoots, carrots and Chinese cornbread, the China Wildlife Conservation Association said. (AFP/Xinhua)

      Li Qiang inaugurates Beijing-funded Pakistan airport

  <div class="itemFullText">
   After arriving in Islamabad, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, on Monday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Pakistan's capital was under strict security lockdown as Li landed in the city ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation this week.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Both the premiers held delegation-level talks. Sharif's office said that he and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   They both also inaugurated virtually the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in southwestern Balochistan province in a ceremony telecast live by Pakistan's state run TV.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Li hailed the new international airport as a vivid illustration of the special friendship between China and Pakistan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Under the strategic guidance of President Xi and Pakistani leaders, the China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership has been continuously deepened, and the China-Pakistan ironclad friendship, which has stood the test of changes in the international situation, is unbreakable, Li said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Premier also met with the country's top military officials including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Army Sahir Shamshad Mirza, according to Xinhua news agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Noting that since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China and Pakistan have always respected and supported each other, Li said that the two countries are good brothers and good partners who have stood the test of the changing international landscape and truly shared weal and woe and helped each other.

  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   Regional leaders on Tuesday arrived in Pakistan's capital Islamabad to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Security in the city is tight for the 23rd SCO summit, with Pakistan deploying 10,000 security personnel, including the army.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The SCO is the world's largest regional bloc in terms of geographic scope, and covers more than 40 percent of the world's population.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Shakeel Ahmad Ramay, CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-Civilisation Research and Development, said enhancing economic opportunities will be high on the summit's agenda.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "China is creating economic linkages through trade and establishing special economic zones," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "In the last few years, China has increased its trade with SCO members, it's around US$383 billion right now."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Another topic that will likely top the agenda, according to Ramay, is regional cooperation to combat terrorism, which has been a big issue for host Pakistan, with the country suffering the recent deadly attacks in Karachi in early October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Ramay also said that more countries, like Saudi Arabia, are looking to join the SCO, but he underscored the difference between the SCO and other regional groups.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "SCO is a partnership organisation, not an alliance or a bloc, like BRICS, thus leaves it more to its members to decide to what extent they want to enhance cooperation," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier, Premier Li Qiang received the honour guard at the Prime Minister's House, where he met his Pakistani counterpart, Shehbaz Sharif, ahead of the summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sharif and Li discussed economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, a US$65 billion investment in the South Asian country under the Belt and Road Initiative.

   China unveiled an ambitious mid to long-term development plan for its space science programme on Tuesday, which will guide the country's space science missions and space research from 2024 to 2050.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The programme, the first of its kind at the national level, was jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the China National Space Administration and the China Manned Space Agency at a press conference on Tuesday.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It outlines the development goals of China's space science, including 17 priority areas under five key scientific themes, as well as a three-phase roadmap.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The five key scientific themes include the extreme universe, space-time ripples, the panoramic view of the Sun and Earth, the search for habitable planets, and the study biological and physical sciences in space. This includes examining black holes and finding signs of extraterrestrial life.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Our country’s space science research in general is still in an initial stage,” Ding Chibiao, a vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said at a news conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “It’s a weakness that must be addressed on the path of building an aerospace power.”
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In the first phase, leading up to 2027, China will focus on the operation of its space station, implementing its manned missions to the moon as well as expanding its planetary exploration missions. (Xinhua/AP)

   President Xi Jinping said a successful partnership between China and the United States is an opportunity for the two countries to be enablers for each other's development rather than an obstacle.

   "China is willing to be a partner and friend with the United States. This will benefit not only the two countries, but the world," Xi said in remarks from a letter to the 2024 annual awards dinner of the National Committee on US-China Relations, according to a CCTV news report.

   Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday proposed closer three-way ties with Russia and Mongolia at a meeting with counterparts from the neighbouring countries on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Speaking to Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Li said the nation is willing to make contributions to the development and revitalisation of the two countries and the prosperity and stability of the world.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He told Mishustin that China was willing to strengthen trade and energy ties with Russia.

   Li added that enhancing cooperation and promoting deeper and practical trilateral cooperation with Russia and Mongolia would better benefit the people of the three countries.

   Mongolia is not a member of the SCO, having chosen instead to be an observer state since 2004. The landlocked nation is on the planned route of a major pipeline that Russia wants to build to carry 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas each year from its Yamal region to China.

   <br/>
   Meanwhile, Eurasian leaders have gathered in the Pakistani capital Islamabad for the SCO summit.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Addressing the event, Li said the SCO is an important platform for safeguarding regional peace and stability and promoting the development and prosperity of all countries.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the expansion of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   “Flagship projects like the Belt and Road Initiative of President Xi Jinping, the China-Pakistan economic corridor, which is in its second phase and the international north south transport corridor, should be expanded focusing on developing road, rail and digital infrastructure that enhances integration and cooperation across our region," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Also in attendance was India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who is the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan in nearly a decade with ties between the nuclear-armed rival neighbours continuing to be frosty. (Agencies)

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

  <div class="itemFullText">
   Far beneath the lush landscape of southern China, a sprawling subterranean laboratory aims to be the world's first to crack a deep scientific enigma.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   China has emerged as a science powerhouse in recent years, with the country's leadership pouring billions of dollars into advanced research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its latest showpiece is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno), a state-of-the-art facility for studying the minuscule subatomic particles.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The project is an "exciting" opportunity to delve into some of the universe's most fundamental -- but elusive -- building blocks, according to Patrick Huber, director of the Center for Neutrino Physics at the American university Virginia Tech, who is not involved in the facility's research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   International media was recently given a tour of the observatory in Kaiping, Guangdong province, organised by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the country's national science agency.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The lab is reached by a funicular train that travels down a tunnel to a cavern built 700 metres underground to limit radiation emissions.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Inside stands the neutrino detector, a stainless steel and acrylic sphere around 35 metres in diameter, crisscrossed by cables.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "No one has built such a detector before," Wang Yifang, Juno's project manager and director of the Institute of High Energy Physics, said as workers in hard hats applied the finishing touches to the gleaming orb.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "You can see from the scale, it was technologically complicated," Wang said as he waved a laser pen over different parts of the installation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Started in 2014, Juno has cost around 2.2 billion yuan to build and is due for completion next year.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It aims to solve a fundamental physics puzzle about the particles' nature faster than scientists in the United States, a world leader in the field.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Its research could also help us better understand planet Earth, the Sun, and other stars and supernovas. (AFP)

      China boosts credit to shore up property market

  <img alt="Housing and Urban-Rural Development Minister Ni Hong leaves at the end of a press conference on China's property sector. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774941_1_20241017114222.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
  <br/>
  <div class="itemFullText">
   China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a "white list" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million "urban villages" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun," Ni told reporters.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In January, China announced a plan for a "white list" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Approved loans for the "white list" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)
