<div class="itemFullText">
 China clinched a third boxing gold at the Paris Olympics, as Li Qian was crowned women's middleweight champion after winning the bout against Panama's Atheyna Bylon on a 4-1 split decision.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li, who took silver in Tokyo, was adjudged as the better performer in two of the three rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old top seed has now collected Olympic medals of all colours, having also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro eight years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said after the bout that by winning gold, she had made amends for the "regret" in Tokyo, and a fitting response to both herself and the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's boxers have won three golds and two silvers in Paris, with all of them coming in women's events.

    China achieves artistic swimming double

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi withstood pressure to clinch the duet, completing an artistic swimming double for China.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 For the third time on Saturday, China secured a clean sweep of gold medals in a sport after Wang Qianyi and Wang Liuyi clinched the duet in artistic swimming.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old twin siblings from Shenzhen performed last out of 17 nations at the Aquatics Centre, after finishing first in the technical routine on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They came back only fourth in the free routine, but the combined score of 566.4783 points was still enough to be crowned champions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Great Britain's Kate Shortman and Isabelle Thorpe won silver at nearly eight points adrift, while the Dutch twins of Bregje and Noortje de Brouwer rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result marked a perfect ending for China, who already struck gold in the team event on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national artistic swimming team were runners-up in both events in the past two Games, losing to Russia on all four occasions. But the defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the country's conflict with Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both the Wang sisters will return to school next month, having already been admitted to the Education University of Hong Kong's Doctor of Education (Chinese prospective) programme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's team completed the country's clean-sweep of table tennis gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after defeating Japan 3-0 in the final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha, Chen Meng and Wang Manyu outclassed a fighting Japanese team of Hina Hayata, Miwa Harimoto and Miu Hirano for China's fifth gold in the sport, after the nation had earlier won both the men's and women's singles, the men's team as well as mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first match of the women's team final, Chen and Wang teamed up in the doubles against Hayata and Harimoto. The Chinese pair came back from two one-game deficits to force a deciding fifth game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Japan raced to a 9-5 lead in the pivotal game, before Chen and Wang went on a 7-1 spurt to win 12-10 and take the first match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hirano then took on Sun in the second match, as she raced to a 7-1 start to open the matchup. However, the world number one Chinese player came roaring back to win the first game 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun then took the next two games, 11-6, 11-6, for a 2-0 lead overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall, Japan's Harimoto put up a fight in the third match by taking the first game against Wang, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese player stormed back to win the next three games, 12-10, 11-7, 11-6 to bring home the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the game, all three Chinese players said Japan proved to be difficult opponents, noting the Japanese were able to lead twice in the opening doubles match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said for her, it was important to come from behind and take the first singles game, adding it was a total team effort for the country to take home all Olympic table tennis golds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy for us to take home all five gold medals. I very much thank our motherland, our team, there are many supportive forces behind us," she told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually today, it wasn't just the three of us competing, the whole Chinese table tennis team were behind us, giving us support."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the introduction of the women's team category in 2008, China has won all five of the event's gold medals.

    Mission accomplished: China sweeps all diving golds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's Cao Yuan (centre) edged out Japan's Rikuto Tamai (left) and Great Britain's Noah Williams to snatch the eighth and final diving gold medal on offer in Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China completed an historic clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Paris Olympics, after Cao Yuan retained his 10m platform title to make it eight wins out of eight for the powerhouse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  As much as the nation has dominated the sport in recent years, it has never taken home every gold medal at a single Games. It came close twice in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, with seven wins
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the once-elusive achievement did not come easy. Cao was locked in a tight battle against Japan's Rikuto Tamai, with the pair separated by less than three points after four rounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But that all changed in the penultimate round, when Tamai committed a serious error on his routine and dropped out of contention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao finished with 547.50 points after six rounds, compared to 507.65 for the Japanese, which was good for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Noah Williams of Great Britain propelled himself to a bronze with a sensational final dive worth 94.35 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Yang Hao, the reigning world champion who beat his compatriot Cao at the World Aquatics Championships in Doha in February, not only was a surprise omission from the podium, but finished last out of the 12 finalists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's rhythmic gymnasts won the group all-around final at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with Israel taking silver and Italy completing the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Each team of five gymnasts had to produce their best performances with five hoops, as well as three ribbons and two balls. The scores were then added up to create a final total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the scoreboard with 36.950 points in the first routine with hoops and a medley of five musical compositions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team continued their strong performance with ribbons and balls to score 32.850, to a total of 69.800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China took home gold by a 0.950-point gap to beat Israel, who came in second with a cumulative of 68.850 points. Italy scored 68.100 to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bulgaria, who won gold at the Tokyo Games, narrowly missed out on a medal despite an impressive comeback from an initial mistake.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team received the highest score in the second routine, recovering from an error in the first performance where two hoops clashed in the air.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weightlifter Liu Huanhua on Saturday won the men's 120-kilogramme division in his debut at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He got to 186 kilogrammes in the snatch at the South Paris Arena, and lifted 220 kilogrammes in his first clean and jerk attempt before failing the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old completed four out of six lifts but it was enough for him to finish with a total score of 406, beating Uzbekistan's Akbar Djuraev by two kilos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Djuraev also failed the final two attempts in the clean and jerk. Yauheni Tsikhantsou took home the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu previously set world records in both the clean and jerk at 232 kilogrammes, as well as the total of 413 kilogrammes in his weight class during the IWF World Cup in Phuket this year.

    PBOC to increase buying and selling of treasury bonds

Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765596_1_20240810084940.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's central bank will seek to "enrich" its monetary policy toolbox and will gradually increase buying and selling of treasury bonds in its open market operations, its second-quarter monetary policy implementation report said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will also seek to steadily lower companies' financing and household credit costs, the report said, adding that prudent monetary policy should be "flexible, moderate, precise and effective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will "guide credit to grow reasonably and balance the supply of credit while keeping liquidity reasonably ample," said the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay attention to changes in long-term bond yields during economic recovery and said it will conduct stress tests on the risk exposures of bond assets held by financial institutions and prevent interest rate risks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's necessary to enrich the monetary policy toolbox, enrich and improve methods of monetary base injection, and gradually increase buying and selling of government bonds in the central bank's open market operations," the PBOC said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The central bank will pay close attention to changes in the monetary policies of major overseas central banks, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economic growth missed forecasts in the second quarter, depressed by a property downturn and sluggish domestic demand, while some July economic indicators showed a mixed and unbalanced recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC will also study plans to appropriately narrow its interest rate corridor and deliver clearer signals of interest rates adjustments to markets. The central bank last month launched temporary repo or reverse repos to make open market operations more efficient and keep the banking system liquidity ample.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the Chinese yuan, the PBOC vowed it will prevent the formation and self-reinforcement of unilateral expectations and will guard against risk of exchange rate overshooting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The yuan is up 0.7 percent against the dollar this month, in tandem with a surging Japanese yen, as an unwinding of short positions snowballed following a surprise rate hike by the Bank of Japan and weakness in US economic indicators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To achieve a stable and sound development of the property sector, the PBOC said it will step up support to construction and seek to boost supplies of affordable housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Keeping prices stable and ensuring moderate inflation will still be a significant consideration of the bank's monetary policy, the bank said, adding it will keep prices at a "reasonable level."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's consumer prices rose at a slightly faster-than-expected rate in July, partly due to weather disruptions in food supplies, while producer deflation persisted, official data showed on Friday. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Controversial boxer Imane Khelif is officially queen of the ring, winning an Olympic gold medal amid a gender row which has cast a shadow over her Paris campaign.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Algerian defeated China's Yang Liu by unanimous decision in the women's 66kg gold medal bout, with all three rounds going in her favour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang, the reigning Asian Games champion, was unable to repel Khelif's fast and powerful punches, often retreating while failing to land good hits on her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The result was written on the wall even before the umpire made the announcement, with Khelif already holding one arm in the air looking ready to celebrate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was consolation for China earlier on Friday night, after Wu Yu clinched gold in the women's 50kg by taking a 4-1 split decision over Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu.

  It was China's second silver medal in the sport, equalling their best-ever finish in Beijing in 2008 when they were also defeated by the Dutch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China nearly pulled off a remarkable upset after Chen Yi put the underdogs ahead just six minutes into the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands then laid siege in front of the Chinese goal, but couldn't find the equaliser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They finally broke down the stubborn defence nine minutes from time, when Yibbi Jansen found just enough space to fire home from a penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides were unable to score again in regulation, and the match had to be decided by a shootout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anne Veenendaal put on a goalkeeping clinic, making three saves to deny China, and helping the Dutch claim their fifth women's crown in six Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing said on Friday it had filed an appeal with the World Trade Organization over the European Union's imposition of additional tariffs on imports of electric vehicles from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In July, the EU slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese EVs after its executive arm concluded in an investigation that they were unfairly undermining European rivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On August 9, China appealed to the World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism over the EU's temporary anti-subsidy measures on EVs," a spokesperson for the country's commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said the appeal aimed to "safeguard the development rights and interests of the electric vehicle industry and cooperation over the global green transformation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU's preliminary ruling lacks a factual and legal basis, seriously violates WTO rules, and undermines the overall situation of global cooperation in addressing climate change," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We urge the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices and jointly maintain the stability of China-EU economic and trade cooperation as well as EV industrial and supply chains."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brussels said it took note of Beijing's move but was "confident" its probe and provisional measures were WTO-compatible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU is carefully studying all the details of this request and will react to the Chinese authorities in due course according to the WTO procedures," a European Commission spokesperson told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Geneva, WTO spokesman Ismaila Dieng said the organization had received the Chinese request.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Further information will be made available once the request has been circulated to WTO members," Dieng added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Definitive duties are due to take effect by November for a five-year period, pending a vote by the EU's 27 states. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s men’s table tennis team of Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Fan Zhendong on Friday took gold at the Paris Olympics, beating the seventh seeded Swedish team 3-0.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This is the fifth straight gold medal for the men's team at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three matches between the teams went the distance and went on for more than two and a half hours at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma and Wang dropped the opening game against Swedish duo Anton Kallberg and Kristian Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the national team came back strong and won the next two games 11-4 and 11-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They lost the fourth game to Sweden 6-11 and took the final game 11-7 to win the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the men’s singles in Paris, took on Sweden’s Truls Moregard in the second match. It went back and forth before Fan pulled through for a 3-2 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number one paddler Wang started strong in the third match and won the first two games 11-9 and 11-5, before losing the next two to Sweden’s Karlsson.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang beat Karlsson 11-2 in the fifth and decisive game, sealing gold for China.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Chen Yiwen triumphed in the women's 3m springboard final on Friday at the Paris Olympics, putting the national team one gold medal away from achieving all eight diving crowns at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chen, who is a first-time Olympian, performed five stellar dives leading the scoreboard throughout all five rounds. She earned a total of 376.00 to top the podium – over 30 points ahead of the silver medallist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 25-year-old attempted a forward 3 ½ somersaults pike in the fourth round, making this her best dive and earning her a 77.50.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Chen’s second gold at these Games, where she also won the women’s synchronised 3m springboard with teammate Chang Yani.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia’s Maddison Keeney came in second, maintaining the silver spot throughout the competition with a score of 343.10. Her last forward 2 ½ somersaults 2 twists pike dive earned her a 78.20, the highest score received in the entire competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chang wasn’t able to replicate the success she had in the synchronised diving having had a rough start finishing at the end of the pack in round one, but she was able to catch up by the fourth round to secure the bronze with a 318.75.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men’s 10m platform final – the last diving event of the Games – begins on Saturday at 9pm Hong Kong time, where China is looking to complete a clean sweep of golds in all eight diving events.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese pair of Xu Shixiao and Sun Mengya powered to victory in the women's canoe double 500 metre final at the Paris Games on Friday, setting a new Olympic record of 1:52.81 and breaking the mark of 1:53.73 that they set earlier in the day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine's Liudmyla Luzan and Anastasiia Rybachok came in second to take silver, with Canada's Sloan Mackenzie and Katie Vincent finishing third to claim bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a tailwind providing some of the choppiest waters seen at the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Xu and Sun got off to an excellent start but the Canadians kept the pressure on them before fading over the final stretch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the national team's second canoe sprint medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's freestyle wrestler Zou Wanhao was not able to make a comeback in the men’s 57 kilogramme category at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 26-year-old lost by a final score of 7-4 to Kyrgyzstan's Bekzat Almaz Uulu in the repechage, bringing his debut Olympic run to an end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uulu will next face Gulomjon Abdullaev of Uzbekistan in the bronze medal bout. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese boxer Chang Yuan dominated from the opening bell to land gold in the women's 54kg final at the Paris Olympics on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old from Hebei province landed a series of blows on her opponent, Turkey's Hatice Akbas, to win a unanimous points victory from the judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang was ahead on four of the five cards after the first round, when Akbas showed occasional signs of danger, but took full control for the latter two three-minute sections, scoring ahead on every card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In truth, Chang had been tested more heavily in earlier rounds, including in a split decision victory over the North Korean, Pang Cholmi, in the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the national team's 29th gold of the Games and the first in boxing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Chinese fighter, Li Qian, made it to the women's 75kg final thanks to a victory by unanimous decision over Caitlin Parker of Australia in Friday's semi-final.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's weightlifter Luo Shifang set three new Olympic records as she claimed gold in the women's 59kg category at the Paris Olympics on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Luo, who's making her Olympic debut, lifted 107kg in the snatch and 134kg in the clean and jerk to go with a winning total of 241kg, all new highs at the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old's total in Paris was 7kg short of her own world record, set in Thailand in April this year at the weightlifting World Cup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canada's Maude Charron took home silver with 236kg, and the champion of the Tokyo Games, Chinese Taipei's Kuo Hsing-Chun, snatched bronze with 235kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the third weightlifting gold for the national team in two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, China's Shi Zhiyong was unable to complete his dream of winning his third gold in as many Olympics, after not being able to complete a lift in all three of his clean and jerk attempts in the men's 73kg category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had built himself a 10kg lead on the field after the snatch, having lifted 165kg in his second attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's Rizki Juniansyah, who lifted an Olympic record of 199kg in clean and jerk for a total of 354kg, took his country's first gold medal in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thailand's Weeraphon Wichuma got silver Bulgaria's Bozhidar Andreev won bronze. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Xie Siyi on Thursday successfully defended his diving crown in men's 3m springboard at the Paris Olympics, with teammate Wang Zongyuan taking silver.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The result means the national team has now sealed six diving golds in its quest for a clean sweep in Paris, with just two more left to contest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two teammates went neck and neck from the start, with only several points separating them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his last of six dives, Xie finished with a 100.7 – the first of only two dives in the final that scored more than 100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It ensured that he finished atop the podium again in Paris, having done the same in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, for his part, made a mistake in the second to last dive, meaning he finished the competition with 530.2 points, 13.4 less than his compatriot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie, who came out of a brief retirement to compete in Paris, said he was nervous during the first two rounds of the final, when he was trailing Wang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the third round, I told myself: I need to slow down. There are so many spectators today – in the previous round there weren't that many," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So with so many people around suddenly, I needed to enjoy the atmosphere, the cheers. They may be for other teams, but I took them as though they were for me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mexico's Osmar Olvera Ibarra grabbed bronze with just a little over 500 points.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lin Yu-ting, one of two boxers at the centre of a gender dispute at the Paris Olympics, moved a step closer to the Olympic title when she beat Turkey's Esra Yildiz by unanimous decision in the women's featherweight semi-finals on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin, twice world champion, and Algerian boxer Imane Khelif have been in the spotlight at the Olympics over a gender row that has dominated headlines and been the subject of much discussion on social media platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old Lin, who is looking to clinch Chinese Taipei's first Olympic title in boxing, faces Poland's Julia Szeremeta in the final on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The feeling of entering the gold-medal match is one of gratitude to myself for making it this far," Lin told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin and Khelif were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) from the 2023 World Championships in New Delhi, with the body saying in a press conference on Monday that a gender test had ruled both of them ineligible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two boxers are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin used her longer reach to keep her Turkish opponent at bay, landing several jabs, but Yildiz would not back down and tried to break through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having lost the first two rounds, the Turk went all in during the last one and landed a right hook, but it was too little, too late to turn the tide in a one-sided affair. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China claimed a second weightlifting gold of the night in dramatic fashion on Thursday morning, as reigning champion Hou Zhihui produced a stunning comeback on the final attempt of the evening to retain her 49kg title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mihaela Cambei of Romania put herself on pole position after clearing 93kg in the snatch, 4kg more than her Chinese opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cambei then thought she had gold in the bag after registering 112kg in the clean and jerk, extending her advantage over Hou to 6kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With her back against the wall, Hou had to clear 117kg on her last attempt – 1kg more than her own Olympic record set in Tokyo three years ago – to leapfrog Cambei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed the clean, then, as the crowd held its breath, mustered just enough energy to execute the jerk, pushing the barbell high above her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old pumped her fists in the air and let out a victorious roar as her lift was confirmed, while Cambei gracefully congratulated her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bronze went to Surodchana Khambao of Thailand.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Guo Qing took silver for China in the women's 49kg taekwondo in the early hours of Thursday, losing to Panipak Wongpattanakit of Thailand in the Olympic final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Guo opened strongly in the final at the Grand Palais, scoring an early head kick before conceding a penalty point, or gam-jeom, and kicks to the head and the body, losing the first round 6-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese athlete made more of a contest of it in the second round, scoring with a punch and a body kick but conceding two gam-jeom to take a 3-2 win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Knowing that any mistake could cost them the title, the two fighters started the final two-minute period cautiously, with the first score coming Panipak's way with just 29 seconds left, care of a head kick adjudicated by video replay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen seconds later, the Thai athlete did the same again, scoring another kick to the head care of a video ruling. Two gam-jeom late in the round put Guo on the scoreboard, but there was no way back for China's representative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There's more taekwondo interest on Thursday, when Lo Wai-fung becomes the first athlete to represent Hong Kong, China in the sport. He's in men’s under 68kg action.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's synchronised swimmers have made history in the pool in the early hours of Thursday, as they put on a dominant performance on the final day of competition to secure their first-ever gold medal at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team were already runaway leaders after the first two routines which took place in the past two days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the silver medallists in Tokyo had everything to lose coming into the last performance, the acrobatic routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Going last out of 10 teams, the octet of Chang Hao, Feng Yu, Wang Qianyi, Wang Ciyue, Wang Liuyi, Xiang Binxuan, Xiao Yanning and Zhang Yayi once again finished first on 283.6934 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That pushed their accumulative score to 996.1389 points, near 82 ahead of the United States and 95 in front of Spain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That broke a two-decade stronghold by Russia, as the six-time defending champions were banned from the Olympics over the conflict with Ukraine.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team will play for a first ever Olympic gold medal after a shock 3-2 shoot-out victory against Belgium on Wednesday, following a 1-1 draw in regulation time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The national team, whose only previous medal at the Olympics came on home astroturf in 2008, looked bound for the final for much of the game, with Zou Meirong putting them ahead from a penalty corner in the 18th minute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Belgians, who had beaten China at the group stage, put the pressure on and finally equalised a minute before the end of regulation though Emma Puvrez from another penalty corner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Drama was to follow in the shoot-out ... in which five players are given eight seconds to run at goal and attempt to score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen Yang saw her attempt saved, allowing the Belgians to take an early lead, but three saves by goalkeeper Ye Jiao gave China victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, who finished only fourth in their group, had already stunned Australia with a 3-2 victory in the quarter final. They'll take on the Netherlands, another giant of the sport, in the final at 2am on Saturday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Netherlands beat China 3-0 in group play, where China had also lost to the Belgians.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s Li Fabin on Wednesday defended his Olympic gold in the men’s 61kg weightlifting, boosting his chances with a new Olympic record in the snatch category.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li lifted a combined 310 kg at the South Paris Arena, slightly lower than his record of 313 kg at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s 7 kg more than Thailand’s Theerapong Silachai in second place, and 12 kg more than Hampton Morris from the US who took bronze and holds the world record for the clean and jerk category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li successfully lifted 137kg, 140kg and 143kg in the snatch event, with the third lift setting a new Olympic record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 31 year old's attempt to clean and jerk 172kg, to equal his own Olympic record from Tokyo, fell narrowly short, with Li buckling as the weights reached his chest. He settled for the 167kg he managed on his second attempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first weightlifting gold and the 23rd gold overall for the national team at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday booked semi-final places in both men's and women's team table tennis at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The men's national team took on South Korea in the last eight at South Paris Arena 4, a day after brushing aside India in the round of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the opening doubles match, Ma Long and Wang Chuqin dominated the South Korean pair of Cho Dae-seong and Jang Woo-jin, winning 11-5, 11-9, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ensuing singles match, Fan Zhendong and Lim Jong-hoon split the first two games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan, who struck gold in the singles contest, then went on to win 11-9, 11-6, putting China up 2-0 in the best-of-five quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Jang then squared off in the next singles match, which went back and forth before Wang pulled through for a 3-1 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China won 3-0 and will take on France in the semi-finals on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a similar result in the women's draw, where Chen Meng, Wang Manyu and Sun Yingsha comfortably saw off Chinese Taipei 3-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded trio did not drop a single game against Chen Szu-Yu, Chien Tung-Chuan and Cheng I-Ching, as they move one step closer to defending their Tokyo title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They take on South Korea in the semi-finals on Thursday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Growth in China's exports slowed last month while imports returned to the black, customs data showed on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Exports were up 7 percent in July year on year after posting an 8.6 percent increase the month before, the strongest rise in 15 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's figure was the weakest since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of the year taken together, exports rose 6.7 percent from a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, meanwhile, rose at a robust 7.2 percent last month, compared with a 2.3 percent contraction in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  July's imports growth was the fastest in three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports climbed 5.4 percent in the January-July period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's trade surplus narrowed to US$84.65 billion in July from US$99.05 billion in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, the trade surplus expanded by 7.9 percent year on year to US$518 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Concerns remained for the world's second-largest economy after second-quarter GDP growth slowed to 4.7 percent from 5.3 percent in the January-March period, keeping alive calls for policymakers to roll out more support to reach the government's full-year growth target of around 5 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ireland's Kellie Harrington has retained her Olympic title, beating China's top seed Yang Wenlu in a much-anticipated gold medal bout.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The women's 60kg showdown took place in front of a raucous crowd inside Court Phillipe Chatrier at Roland Garros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harrington got off to a good start, taking the first round when four of five judges ruled in her favour. Yang tried to respond but lost round two 4-1 on the cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the verge of victory, Harrington turned defensive in the final round, looking to run down the clock instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her tactic worked, as she won by a 4-1 split decision to become the first Irishwoman to win back-to-back Olympic golds. The 34-year-old amateur boxer was in tears as her victory was confirmed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier in the ring, Algeria's Imane Khelif remains on course for a gold medal after ousting Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand on 5-0 unanimous decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Khelif, who was disqualified by the now-suspended International Boxing Association last year after failing gender tests, will take on China's Yang Liu in the women's 66kg final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang advanced after beating Chinese Taipei's Chen Nien-chin by a split decision of 4-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her compatriot Wu Yu also progressed to the women's 50kg gold medal bout, after the top seed defeated Kazakhstan's Nazym Kyzaibay.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Cole Hocker delivered one of the all-time Olympic shocks when he won the 1,500 metres gold with a stunning finish to blast past world champion Josh Kerr as defending champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen faded to fourth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race had been billed as a showdown between Ingebrigtsen and Kerr and the Norwegian set a hot pace as he led coming into the last 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Briton Kerr, just as he did in last year’s world championships, surged past him and looked set for victory, only for Hocker to find a way through on the inside.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His winning time of three minutes 27.65 was an Olympic record and a massive personal best by more than three seconds. Kerr posted a national record 3:27.79 and Yared Nuguse took bronze for the US in another huge pb of 3:27.80.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ingebrigtsen finished fourth in a time faster than his Olympic record set in Tokyo, but the double world champion over 5,000m has another shot at a medal as he goes in the heats over that distance on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Gabby Thomas finally claimed the global title she has promised for so long when she delivered a dominant performance to take Olympic 200 metres gold, denying silver medallist Julien Alfred a sprint double.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, 27, took bronze in Tokyo and silver in last year’s world championships, but she was in control throughout the final, coming home in 21.83 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alfred, who claimed Saint Lucia’s first Olympic medal when she won the 100m on Saturday, was a clear second in 22.08, with Brittany Brown taking bronze for the US in 20.20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's Zhao Jie claimed bronze in the women's hammer throw, behind Camryn Rogers, who won gold for Canada, and Annette Echikunwoke of the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greece's Miltiadis Tentoglou retained the gold medal in the men's long jump. Jamaican Wayne Pinnock took silver and Italy's Mattia Furlani claimed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bahrain's Winfred Yavi won the women's 3,000 metres steeplechase. Uganda's Peruth Chemutai took silver and Kenya's Faith Cherotich claimed bronze. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of a first-ever men's wrestling gold were dashed early on Wednesday as Cao Liguo was beaten by Japan's Kenichiro Fumita in the 60kg Greco-Roman final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile there was history in the 130kg Greco-Roman final, when Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual gold medals in the same event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita won by a cumulative score of 4-1 over two periods, and led from start to finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao requested a challenge out of desperation as time expired, but the judge ruled the result would stand and the 25-year-old Guangxi native had to settle for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zholaman Sharshenbekov of Kazakhstan and North Korean Ri Se-ung earlier took bronze in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has only two Olympic wrestling golds, with the last one coming in 2008 when Wang Jiao clinched the women's 72kg freestyle. Since then the team has racked up three silvers and four bronzes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fumita, meanwhile, becomes the first Japanese entrant to win a Greco-Roman gold since 1984.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the 130kg final, Lopez, who turns 42 in two weeks' time, defeated Chile's Yasmani Acosta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With his victory, Lopez broke a tie for four successive individual Olympic golds he shared with Carl Lewis (athletics/long jump), Michael Phelps (swimming/200m medley), Katie Ledecky (swimming/800m freestyle), Al Oerter (athletics/discus), Paul Elvstrom (sailing) and Kaori Icho (wrestling).

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's teenage sensation Quan Hongchan comfortably defended her diving gold in the 10 metre platform, fending off teammate Chen Yuxi who took silver while Kim Mi-rae of North Korea rounded up the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That marked a second gold medal for 17-year-old Quan in Paris, having clinched the 10 metre synchronised platform title with Chen earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China remains on track for a clean sweep of diving gold medals at the Games, clinching five so far, with three more up for grabs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performing last out of the 12 finalists, Quan showed composure and led after each of the five rounds for a wire-to-wire victory. She couldn't replicate her Olympic record of 466.2 points set in Tokyo, finishing with 425.6 this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By comparison, Chen accumulated 420.7 points, and 372.1 for Kim. The North Korean clinched her country's first Olympic medal in an individual diving event.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The youngest Olympian in Paris, 11-year-old Zheng Haohao from China, had a strong first run in the women's park skateboarding preliminaries on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough for her to advance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng had an opening score of 63.19 with a clean run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she fell in her second and third runs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Each competitor had three runs, and their ranking is determined by the highest score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The score of 63.19 placed Zheng 18th out of 22 athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australian teenage skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew won the Olympic gold, edging out Japan's Cocona Hiraki in silver and Britain's injured Sky Brown in bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trew, 14, in her trademark pink helmet, nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round to leap to the top of the rankings, bringing some of the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde stadium. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's volleyball team on Tuesday crashed out of the Paris Olympics, suffering a 3-2 defeat to Turkey in a nail-biting quarter-final clash at South Paris Arena 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China, who are three-time Olympic champions, claimed the first set 25-23 before dropping the next two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They took the fourth set to force a tie-breaker, but fell short 15-12 in the deciding fifth set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Melissa Teresa Vargas scored 42 points to lead the Turkish women to victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was tied 11-all in the fifth set before a smash of Vargas and a spiking error from Wu Mengjie of China pushed Turkey up 13-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gong Xiangyu had a smash to pull China within 13-12, but another kill of Vargas and a smart play of Elif Sahin – who replaced injured starting setter Cansu Ozbay in the last three sets – sealed the victory for the Turkish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Vargas played a great game," said China head coach Cai Bin. "We tried our best to stop her, but could not do that well enough."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey next face Serbia or Italy in the semi-finals. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

 Defending champions China on Tuesday eased past India in the round of 16 in men's team table tennis at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma Long and Wang Chuqin drew first blood in the opening doubles match.

    China will launch satellites to rival Starlink: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carries Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764990_1_20240806155559.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A state-owned enterprise is close to launching the first batch of satellites for a megaconstellation designed to rival US company Space X's Starlink's near-global internet network, a mainland newspaper has reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A successful launch would mark an important step in Beijing's strategic goal of creating its own version of Starlink, a growing commercial broadband constellation that has about 5,500 satellites in space and is used by consumers, companies and government agencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch, led by Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), will take place at Taiyuan Satellite Launch Centre, one of the nation's main satellite and missile launch centres, located in the northern province of Shanxi, the China Securities Journal reported on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The launch is part of SSST's "Thousand Sails Constellation" plan, also known as the "G60 Starlink Plan", which began last year and aims to deploy more than 15,000 low Earth orbit (Leo) satellites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo satellites usually operate at altitudes of 300km to 2,000km from the Earth's surface and have the advantage of being cheaper and providing more efficient transmission than satellites at higher orbits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starlink, operated by billionaire Elon Musk, has tens of thousands of users in the United States so far and plans to add tens of thousands more satellites to its system, which is the largest of its kind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's "Thousand Sails constellation" is one of three "ten-thousand star constellation" plans China is hoping will allow it to close the gap with SpaceX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SSST's plan is to launch 108 satellites this year, 648 satellites by the end of 2025, provide a "global network coverage" by 2027, and get to 15,000 satellites deployed before 2030. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rebeca Andrade of Brazil got the better of American Simone Biles in the women’s floor exercise final on Monday, bringing the artistic gymnastics competition to an end at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Andrade brought flair to her routine at the Bercy Arena, as she executed every move with precision to earn a difficulty score of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.266, to bring the total to 14.166.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the Brazilian's first gold medal in Paris after she won two silvers in the all-around and vault and a bronze in the team event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles, who was the floor champion in Rio in 2016, brought the highest difficulty of 6.900 to the competition with skills named after her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She completed her routine with incredible height and technique, but she stepped out of bounds which led to a penalty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles ended up with a final score of 14.133 to win silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old finished the Paris Games with three golds and one silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles’ teammate Jordan Chiles was the final performer of the competition, and was fifth after her routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her score was bumped to a 13.766 after an inquiry, beating out Ana Barbosu of Romania for the bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Ou Yushan finished eighth of the nine competitors with a score of 13.000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Shinnosuke Oka of Japan has captured his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics, winning the horizontal bar final on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Oka executed a clean routine to come away with a score of 14.533.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a difficulty of 5.900 and an execution score of 8.633.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Colombia’s Angel Barajas also had a score of 14.533 but had to settle for silver because Oka had a higher execution mark.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both were competing in their first Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the fourth medal in Paris for Oka, who has already won gold in the team event and the all-around as well as a bronze in the parallel bars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Zhang Boheng and Tang Chia-hung of Chinese Taipei shared the bronze medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang, also a first-time Olympian, completed his routine with clean technique and execution, but the 24-year-old wasn’t able to stick his dismount, falling forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He earned a 13.966 with a difficulty of 6.500 and execution of 7.466.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had a small fall in the middle of his routine, but the rest of his technique was able to pull him to a 13.966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The horizontal bar final saw its share of errors and falls, including China’s Su Weide who was unable to land on his feet, leaning forward to catch himself with his hands. He finished in fifth place.

<div class="itemFullText">
 American Simone Biles fell out of medal contention in the women’s artistic gymnastics balance beam final on Monday at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Italy’s Alice D’Amato finished a solid routine to earn a score 14.366, with a difficulty score of 5.800 and an execution score of 8.566, for her first Olympic gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s Zhou Yaqin earned silver thanks to a strong finish. She started off the competition with a clean routine, adding many connecting elements to boost her difficulty score.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 18-year-old gymnast lost her balance at one point, but she was able to stay on the beam to earn her a 14.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou finished a close second behind Biles at the World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Italian gymnast, Manila Esposito, completed the podium in Paris with a score of 14.000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biles slipped and fell off the apparatus at the end of her acrobatic series, unable to complete the last flip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to finish her routine and stick the landing, and the 27-year-old was tied for fourth.

 China’s Zou Jingyuan retained his title in the men’s artistic gymnastics parallel bars on Monday at the Paris Olympics, while compatriot Zhang Boheng missed out of the podium after being edged out by Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The reigning champion executed his routine with precision, hitting each handstand and hold to earn him a difficulty score of 6.900 and an execution score of 9.300, for an overall 16.200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukraine’s Illia Kovtun won silver with the highest difficulty of the competition of 7.000, to earn a 15.500 total.

  <br/>
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 South Korea's An Se-young consolidated her status as the top player in women's badminton by winning the Olympic title on Monday, beating China's He Bingjiao in the final in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Reigning world champion An, who has held the number one ranking for the past year, beat her sixth-seeded opponent 21-13, 21-16 at a lively La Chapelle Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old An is the dominant force in women's badminton and won eight titles on the world tour last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She became South Korea's first Olympic women's singles champion since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He, who lost the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, progressed to the final when her opponent Carolina Marin retired from their semi-final after collapsing with a knee injury.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was looking to win China's third badminton gold of the Paris Games, following successes in mixed and women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He made An work for every point in a fast and furious first game, until the South Korean began to ease ahead towards the finish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She closed the first game out when He smashed a return into the net.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An quickly gained the upper hand in the second game and her march towards the title began to look inevitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He slowed her progress with an incredible smash return midway through the game but An would not be stopped and she sealed the win on her third match point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My golden age isn't here yet because I'm still young," the South Korean gold medallist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will still have more experiences and I will be able to play even better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said she was happy to take home the silver medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think from the moment I qualified for the Olympics it’s been a hard journey, since at the time I was only able to come here because I won by a slight margin by the end. So I treasure this opportunity a lot, and I am very happy that I can come all the way from preliminaries to the end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung won the bronze by default after Marin's semi-final retirement. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Veteran sharpshooter Li Yuehong claimed his maiden gold medal in his third Olympic appearance with victory in the men's 25m rapid fire pistol on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 34-year-old world-record holder made 32 hits in the final to secure China's fifth shooting gold in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  South Korea's Cho Yeong-jae won silver, scoring 25, while Li's compatriot Wang Xinjie took bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's been an incredible experience for me – all of my personal hard work and the effort my team put into this game have finally paid off," Li said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a victory not only for myself, but rather for the whole team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li won bronze at both the Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's shooting pair of Jiang Yiting and Lyu Jianlin took home bronze in the mixed skeet event, with Lyu not missing a single shot in their 44-43 win against India.

<div class="itemFullText">
 At the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris, a pavilion has been set up on the sidelines of the Olympic Games to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between China and France.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The China House – featuring Chinese-style galleries, exhibits and ancient Olympic sports – was launched by the Chinese Olympic Committee two days before the opening of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The committee's deputy secretary general Yu Jianyong said the China House "is a bridge to promote friendly exchanges between China and foreign countries and promote the mutual construction of civilisations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A team of volunteers maintains its operation, some of whom are from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said it was a dream come true to be part of the Games and experience the Olympic hype in the French capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raheema, a Chinese-Pakistani studying in the SAR, said the experience allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and meet people from all over the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As someone that is really introverted, it's really hard for me to be able to communicate with others,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics is about bringing different people with different backgrounds and different stories all together, being able to communicate with everyone I can broaden my horizons and also understand more about different people.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another volunteer, Annie, said she was inspired after seeing the earliest forms of Olympic sports at the China House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We feel like we can learn a lot more about the whole historical part and at the same time to really experience the whole Olympic atmosphere in person right in France this year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Annie added that she also found it inspirational to speak with athletes from the national team there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the visitors at the China House was a diving gold medallist at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, He Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he thinks people should just enjoy the Games and not put too much pressure on athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we should look at these [athletes] with a more rational perspective. They are here to join the world's top sports event and chase their dreams. We should not focus on how many gold medals they can win for China."

 China dethroned the United States in the men's 4x100m medley relay, winning gold in a time of three minutes, 27.46 seconds, edging the US into silver by 0.55 seconds at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  France won the bronze, handing swimming star Leon Marchand his fifth medal of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu Jiayu and Qin Haiyang kept the Chinese in contention in the back and breast strokes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  France's Maxime Grousset and the US's Caleb Dressel pulled ahead of Sun Jiajun in the fly portion of the race, but an incredible 45.92 anchor leg from Pan Zhanle, the world record holder in the 100 metres free, ensured the win for China who ended America's 64-year unbeaten run in the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in the women's medley relay, the Americans dominated, smashing their own world record in the event to close the swimming meet at the Olympics with the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia took the silver and China grabbed bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US quartet of Regan Smith, Lilly King, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske touched out with a final time of 3 minutes 49.63 seconds at the La Defense Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  American Bobby Finke smashed the men's 1,500 metres freestyle world record as he retained the Olympic gold medal in a thrilling swim.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After 30 lung-busting laps, Finke touched the wall in 14 minutes, 30.67 seconds, eclipsing Chinese star Sun Yang's 12-year-old mark of 14:31.02 set at the London Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Gregorio Paltrinieri took silver, 3.88 seconds behind Finke, with Daniel Wiffen, the 800m gold medallist, taking the bronze for Ireland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Swedish sprint star Sarah Sjostrom completed a freestyle sprint double by adding the women's 50 metres gold to her 100 title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia's Meg Harris took the silver as the only other woman under 24 seconds and China's Zhang Yufei the bronze for her sixth medal of the Games and 10th of her career. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese Taipei badminton stars Lee Yang and Wang Chi-lin successfully defended their men's doubles title on Sunday, defeating China's Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang 2-1 in a thrilling final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Taipei pair, unseeded at the tournament, jumped out to a 5-2 lead and maintained a three-point edge until midway through the first game against Liang and Wang, ranked number one in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides then traded 4-0 runs, before Chinese Taipei closed on a high to take the first game 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee and Wang kept it going to start the second game, taking an early 4-1 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Team China refused to give in, tying the score on several occasions before winning the game 21-18 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first part of the final game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than two and Chinese Taipei taking a 11-10 lead into the break.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a 12-11 edge, Chinese Taipei's Wang managed to save a couple of smashes from the floor before eventually conceding the point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the younger Liang and Wang shared a few smiles during breaks in the tight moments, they made several key mistakes, with Wang being called for a service violation that gave the Chinese Taipei pair a 16-13 advantage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China managed to close the gap to 18-19, before the defending champions took control late to win the third game, 21-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who announced before the tournament his plans to retire next month after the Taipei Open, slumped to the floor alongside Wang in celebration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two are the only badminton players from Chinese Taipei to ever win Olympic gold medals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Team China dominated the podium with a gold and silver in the men’s artistic gymnastics rings final on Sunday at the Bercy Arena in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu Yang, who is the reigning Olympic champion in this event, earned a score of 15.300 with a difficulty of 6.400 and an executive score of 8.900 to land him the gold. The 29-year-old executed his movements with precision and stability, with just a small step and lean forward during the landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His Chinese counterpart Zou Jingyuan, who is dubbed the king of parallel bars, came behind with a score of 15.233, while Eleftherios Petrounias of Greece, who also won the bronze in this event at the Tokyo Games, completed the podium with an overall score of 15.100.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu said afterwards he was glad he was able to defend his Olympic crown, but he felt his performance "wasn't perfect enough".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Compared to Tokyo, psychologically and experience wise, I'm now more mature. But physically, I have had a lot more injuries and issues, and so this time, it's mainly about overcoming physical problems," he told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu added that he wanted to thank his family and the motherland for their support, while saying the gymnastics team had been united despite some regrets at the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's gymnasts won the silver in the team event, after a slip up in the last round saw Japan leapfrog them for gold.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's table tennis star Fan Zhendong on Sunday won gold in the men's singles at the Paris Olympics, beating his Swedish opponent 4-1 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, who won silver at the Tokyo Games three years ago, fell behind early, with Sweden's Truls Moregard winning the opening game 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the second seed from China came roaring back, winning the next four games to clinch victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan took the second and third games 11-9 and the fourth game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the fifth game, the 27-year-old Fan raced to a big 10-3 lead before Moregard saved five match points to make it 10-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan secured the next point to win the game and his first Olympics singles title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He lost to compatriot Ma Long in the final in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is also China's 17th gold medal at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I have to believe in my ability and my strengths, to keep myself calm and be able to bring the match to my own pace," Fan said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did not do too well in the first game, as well as the opening of the second game. But I adjusted my mentality and played better later on."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the end of a dream run for Moregard, ranked 26th in the world, who upset the Chinese top seed Wang Chuqin in the round of 32 en route to the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Lebrun from France, who was beaten by Fan in the semi-finals, claimed bronze after defeating his Brazilian opponent, Hugo Calderano.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's He Bingjiao on Sunday booked a place in the women's badminton singles final at the Paris Olympics after her semi-final opponent withdrew because of injury.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Spain's Carolina Marin, who won gold in the 2016 Rio Games, started off strong against the Chinese shuttler, taking the first game 21-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marin was leading 10-6 in the second when she appeared to have injured her right knee and collapsed to the floor in tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She put on a knee brace and played two more points before deciding to retire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Spaniard limped off the court to a standing ovation from the crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her Chinese opponent told reporters that she felt very sad about what had happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She was playing perfectly well and I was very passive," said He. "I wasn't thinking about the final at all."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He advanced to the final to play world number one, An Seyoung from South Korea, who beat Indonesia's Gregoria Mariska Tunjung in the other semis. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has claimed the biggest victory of her budding career, clinching a gold medal on her Olympic debut by defeating Croatian veteran Donna Vekic in the women's final on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixth-seeded Zheng made a name for herself after upsetting world number one Iga Swiatek in the last four on Thursday. The 21-year-old carried that momentum into the showdown at Roland Garros, leading Vekic from wire to wire for the 6-2, 6-3 victory in one hour and 45 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After converting on her first match point, China's top woman dropped to the ground and punched her fists in the air as a large Chinese contingent in the stands erupted in cheers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng is the first Chinese woman to win an Olympic singles gold, and to achieve the feat on her debut made it all the more special.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Compatriots Li Ting and Sun Tiantian also struck gold in 2004 in the women's doubles, while Yan Zi and Zheng Jie took home bronze at the same event four years later in Beijing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's badminton pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan on Saturday won an Olympic gold in Paris, defeating compatriots Liu Shenshu and Tan Ning in straight games for the women's doubles title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan – the third seed at the Paris Games – took a 20-17 lead in the first game, but the top seeded Chen and Jia saved four game points to win 22-20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensing that their opponents' confidence was wavering, Chen and Jia rushed to a 9-2 edge to start the second game, before leading 11-7 at intermission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu and Tan then cut the deficit to bring the score to 11-13, but that was the closest they managed to get, as the top shuttlers won the second game 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was China's first gold in the women's doubles since 2012, and sixth since the event became a fixture at the Olympics in 1992.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia had previously come up short in Tokyo, finishing second on the podium after losing to Indonesians Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's table tennis player Chen Meng on Saturday put herself in the record books with an emphatic 4-2 victory against compatriot Sun Yingsha in Paris, becoming the third person to defend an Olympic women's singles crown.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The all-China matchup was a repeat of the Tokyo Games, when Chen also defeated Sun by the same margin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's final was an intense affair, with top-seed Sun starting off well – winning the first game 11-4 – before second-seeded Chen won the next two, 11-7, 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Determined not to go down 1-3, Sun scored five straight points in game four to break a 5-5 tie and eventually wrapped up the game 11-9 to tie the score at two games apiece.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the pivotal game five, the score was tied multiple times, with Chen eventually breaking the deadlock at 9-9 to win 11-9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She went on to take the final game 11-6 to seal the win, following in the footsteps of ping pong greats Deng Yaping and Zhang Yining, who had successfully defended their Olympic singles titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the sport was introduced to the Olympics in 1988, China has won all 10 gold medals in the women's singles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's hopes of clinching a first Olympic tennis gold medal in two decades were dashed as the nation's mixed doubles pair came up short against the Czech Republic in a thrilling final which ended at nearly midnight, Paris time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen were broken twice in the opening set, which they conceded after just 23 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But after settling in, the pair were neck and neck against Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac. Set two lasted nearly twice as long, with Wang and Zhang taking it 7-5 in 40 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the match at one set apiece, a 10-point tiebreak ensued to decide who would be gold medallists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The raucous Chinese supporters inside Court Philippe Chatrier were in a frenzy after their side went up 3-0. But the Czechs levelled the score and bagged the last four points of the match, including a crucial double fault by their opponents at 8-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The dramatic slip-up meant China had to make do with a silver. It was still the first tennis medal for the nation since Zheng Jie and Yan Zi struck bronze in the women's doubles in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That followed a gold by Li Ting and Sun Tiantian in the same discipline in Athens four years prior.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China added a silver and a bronze to their haul in the men's trampoline, while reigning champion Ivan Litvinovich successfully defended his Olympic title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both Yan Langyu and 18-year-old Wang Zisai were hoping to dethrone Litvinovich, the Belarusian who competed as an "individual neutral athlete" because of his nation's involvement in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang, who started third in the eight-man final, briefly led the pack with a score of 61.89 while Yan was close behind in second.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were judged by their routine's difficulty, execution, horizontal displacement and time of flight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Litvinovich was second last to go, and he withstood pressure to win in 63.09.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong smashed their way to a gold medal in the mixed doubles badminton event on Friday at the Paris Olympics, beating Kim Won-ho and Jeong Na-eun of South Korea in straight sets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Japanese pair of Yuta Watanabe and Arisa Higashino won the bronze medal match to complete the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After receiving her medal on the podium, Huang's boyfriend and fellow Chinese shuttler Liu Yuchen proposed to her in front of an ecstatic crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang made a commanding start with a strong attack to put them far ahead. Kim and Jeong tried their best to defend, but could not overcome the world number one duo in the first game 21-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans stepped up their efforts with more attacks in the beginning of the second game, knowing this would determine their position on the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese side’s tactic to target one specific player at a time immediately put them back in the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese pair's powerful smash shots further widened the gap to end the game 21-11 and earn a gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng and Huang lost to their Chinese counterparts at the Tokyo Olympics in the gold medal match, but this time around they were able to reach the top of the podium in just under an hour of game play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cap off her already special day, Huang's boyfriend Liu made a surprise appearance at the arena. He came prepared with an engagement ring, and presented it to Huang while on one knee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will love you for my whole life. Will you marry me?" Liu asked in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overcome with joy, Huang said 'yes'.

 Wang Zongyuan and Long Daoyi won the men's synchronised 3-metre springboard event at the Paris Olympics on Friday to claim the nation's fourth gold in diving.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Both second-time Olympians, the pair finished on 446.10 points.

  <br/>
  Wang, 22, previously won gold in the same event in Tokyo three years ago with Xie Siyi, who is only competing in the individual event as defending champion in this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo trailed after the fourth of six dives, but they rallied on the final two dives to take China's fourth straight gold medal and stay on track for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Long and Wang held off the Mexican team of Juan Celaya and Osmar Olvera with 444.03.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Table tennis powerhouse China on Friday secured places in both singles finals at the Paris Olympics, after Fan Zhendong made it through on the men's side while Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha set up an all-China final in the women's competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan, the second seed on the men's side, crushed local favourite Felix Lebrun 4-0 in a little more than half an hour in the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan won 11-8, 11-6, 11-7 and 11-5 to silence the home crowd.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He became China's only medal hopeful in the men's singles after top-seeded Wang Chuqin was stunned by Sweden's Truls Moregard in an earlier round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third-seeded Lebrun, who's only 17, did manage a three-point lead in the third game, but was otherwise outclassed by Fan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fan will face Moregard in the final, after the Swede defeated Brazil's Hugo Calderano 4-2 in a gruelling semi-final matchup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the women's side, Chen has a chance to retain her Olympic singles title, after an emphatic 4-0 trouncing of South Korea's Shin Yubin in the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top-seeded Sun Yingsha, also from China, secured an all-China final after brushing aside Japan's Hina Hayata 4-0 in the other semi-final tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun won 11-6, 11-8, 11-8, 11-2, while not allowing the Japanese to take a lead in the last two games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It will be a guaranteed gold and silver for the national team as two Chinese pairs advanced to the final in the women’s doubles badminton event on Friday at La Chapelle Arena.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first semi-final match, the pair of Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan beat their Malaysian counterparts 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number one duo easily took the first game, 21-12, against Pearly Tan and Muralitharan Thinaah.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Malaysians fought back 21-18 in the second, the first game the Chinese duo dropped in five matches throughout the tournament in France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen and Jia then repeatedly targeted Tan, winning one point by directing multiple smashes at the Malaysian who managed a couple of acrobatic saves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese eventually prevailed and took the final game, 21-15, to book their place in the final. The two had won silver medals at the Tokyo Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the other match, Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning won in straight sets, after defeating Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida of Japan 2-0.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both sides fought aggressively in game one. The points were fairly equal until the national team pulled ahead to take it 21-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the Japanese team managed to win a few points in the first half of the second game, the Chinese pair were able to widen the gap, ultimately winning 21-19.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese weather authorities said July was the country's hottest month since records began, state media said on Thursday, as extreme temperatures persist across large parts of the globe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last month was "the hottest July since complete observations began in 1961, and the hottest single month in the history of observation", state broadcaster CCTV said, citing weather authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The average air temperature in China last month was 23.21 degrees Celsius (73.78 degrees Fahrenheit), exceeding the previous record of 23.17 C in 2017, CCTV reported the weather authorities as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mean temperature in every province was also "higher than the average for previous years", with the southwestern provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan logging their highest ever averages, according to the report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has experienced by extreme weather this summer, with heat waves scorching parts of the north while torrential rains have triggered floods and landslides in central and southern areas. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Zheng Qinwen of China stunned women's world number one Iga Swiatek on Thursday to become the first player from the nation to reach an Olympic Games tennis singles final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventh-ranked Zheng triumphed 6-2, 7-5 and will face either Croatia's Donna Vekic or Anna Karolina Schmiedlova of Slovakia in the gold medal match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel more than just happy – happy isn't enough to describe how I feel," said Zheng, who had played back-to-back three-hour matches to make the semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you ask me to play another three hours for my country, I would. It was an amazing match. To beat Iga is not easy, as it's an important event for her."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swiatek, a four-time French Open champion at Roland Garros, went into Thursday's match at a sweltering Court Philippe Chatrier on a 25-match win streak in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old had defeated Zheng in all of their six previous meetings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the mixed doubles, the Chinese pair of Wang Xinyu and Zhang Zhizhen reached the final after defeating their opponents from the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Zhang were slow off the block in the semi-final, conceding the opening set 2-6 to Demi Schuurs and Wesley Koolhof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chinese pair levelled the match at one set apiece by winning set two 6-4, before clinching the tie-break 10-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will face the winner of the other semi-final between the pairs from Canada and the Czech Republic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final is scheduled on Saturday morning, Hong Kong time at Roland Garros. (AFP)
