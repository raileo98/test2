<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for better relations with South Korea as he met with his counterpart from Seoul during rare talks in Beijing, Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The visit by Cho Tae-yul to the capital on Monday and Tuesday is the first visit by a South Korean foreign minister to Beijing in over six years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ties between the two countries "have been facing difficulties and challenges", Wang said, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called for the two sides to "understand and respect each other, strengthen communication and exchanges, eliminate misunderstandings and enhance mutual trust", the Xinhua report stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that Seoul would "properly and prudently" handle Taiwan-related issues and abide by the "one-China" policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cho said better ties were in the "common interests" of both countries and that Seoul was willing to expand mutual trust, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cho also told Wang their countries should work together and "even if there are difficulties, momentum of cooperation should be continued while carefully managing the relations," according to the South Korean foreign ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that they could continue to prepare for a summit of the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan in Seoul, planned for the end of May. The leaders of the three countries last met in China in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese statement made no mention of the summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Cho also agreed, according to their ministries, that the economic ties of the two countries had been a force in each other's development, and agreed to strengthen their cooperation, including the ensuring of stable supply chains. (AFP/Reuters)

    Charm offensive as Xi ramps up 'people diplomacy'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan wave as they arrive at Belgrade Airport, the second stop of Xi's European tour. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752886_1_20240513054450.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping’s latest trip to Europe was one of the signs that Beijing is ramping up "people-to-people" diplomacy to counter-balance trade tensions, as the president went on a charm offensive to boost economic ties with central and southeast Europe, according to a political commentator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the president wrapped up his visit to France, Serbia and Hungary, Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and the chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK that Xi also hoped to show Europe that what China had been doing over the past 10 years - including with the Belt and Road Initiative - "has been all trade and growth".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over 50 different agreements were signed between China and these three nations, covering all areas...," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What he’s doing is definitely people-to-people diplomacy, especially at the higher level, you could see very clearly that he had a very good rapport on a personal level with President Macron, as well as [the] leaders of both Hungary and Serbia, and he actually stayed an extra couple of hours in Serbia," Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi’s visit to the region, which was the first in five years, came at a critical time amid mounting trade pressure, with the European Union (EU) pressing ahead with investigations into China's critical sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, and medical devices - in a bid to ease the bloc’s trade deficit with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told reporters after talks with Xi that the European Union was "ready to make full use of trade defence instruments" to defend European economies, but Tangen rejected this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overcapacity issue [raised] is completely false," Tangen commented. He said that when Europe and America dominated manufacturing worldwide, they attributed it to market competition and the natural superiority of their products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today, as China is able to sell goods and services at a lower rate, all of a sudden it became 'why hasn’t China been watching out for Europe and the US?'" Tangen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The fact is, these are developed dominant countries that cannot fulfil their own needs and desires from their own countries. If they weren't buying from China, they would be buying from somewhere else, [so] it’s not going to address their trade deficit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What the EU should really be concerned about is their competitiveness. What is the future of the EU?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With over half of the world's population heading to vote for new leaders of more than 80 nations over the course of 2024, Tangen expects trade tensions to continue in the short and medium term as policymakers court voters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Really, communication is absolutely key," Tangen said. "And in the long term it is about people-to-people exchanges. It takes time and you have to be willing to wait and engage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Concentrating on sports and education, and bringing young people into the play. And this is a very long-term strategy by the Chinese government."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's inflation rate quickened last month, according to official data released on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent year-on-year in April, staying in positive territory for the third straight month, according to the  National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That compared with a 0.2 percent rise forecast by Bloomberg analysts and was higher than the 0.1 percent increase in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In April, household consumption demand continued to rebound... and the year-on-year increase expanded," the NBS said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the producer price index sank by 2.5 percent year-on-year, the NBS said. (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping arrived in Hungary on Wednesday evening, state media said, in the last leg of his European tour after visiting France and Serbia earlier this week.

  Broadcaster CCTV said Xi "arrived in Budapest by special plane and began his state visit to Hungary, at the invitation of Hungarian President Tamas Sulyok and Prime Minister Viktor Orban".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry on Wednesday said it firmly opposes the US withdrawing export licences to telecommunications equipment maker Huawei, as it also vowed to take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interest of Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The remarks came after the US Commerce Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has revoked some export licences related to Huawei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, a Reuters report, citing sources, noted that the US government has withdrawn special licences that allows chip suppliers Qualcomm and Intel to sell order-generation semiconductors to Huawei for use in its laptops and handsets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing called the move by Washington “a typical practice of economic coercion” and a “violation to its commitment to not decouple from China”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The US has generalised the concept of national security, politicised economic and trade issues, abused export control measures, and repeatedly imposed unreasonable sanctions and repression on specific Chinese firms. China is firmly opposed to this,” a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said in response to media inquiry on the reported cancellation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It not only violates World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, but also severely harms the interests of US companies. What the US has done has significantly violated its commitment,” the spokesperson added, citing that these actions are also in stark contrast to the US claim of “precisely defining national security”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei did not immediately comment on the decision by the US Commerce Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancellations came after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro, powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra9 processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid spying concerns.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that a free trade agreement between China and Serbia will take effect on July 1.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is one of six measures announced by the president to support the building of a China-Serbia community with a shared future, as he met the press with his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, after they held talks in Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbia is the first European country to build such a community with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures announced by Xi, there will be more direct flights between Belgrade and Shanghai and airlines will be encouraged to launch direct flights between Belgrade and Guangzhou, and China is ready to import more high-quality agricultural products from Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a strategic choice made by both sides to build a China-Serbia community with a shared future in the new era. Its goal is to realise the aspiration of the two peoples for a better life. Its foundation and driving force come from the firm support and extensive participation of the two peoples," Xi said in a joint press conference with Vucic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vucic called Xi an “ironclad” friend and said his visit to Serbia is “historic” because it opens the path for even closer ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a joint statement, the two countries said they decided to deepen and elevate the China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday night on the second leg of his European tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit comes on the anniversary of the Nato bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 1999 during a campaign against the former Yugoslavia to force late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to end a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The bombing killed three Chinese journalists and wounded 20 Chinese nationals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese people appreciate the peace but will never allow that a historic tragedy repeats itself," Xi said in an opinion article in the daily Politika on Tuesday. (Xinhua and agencies)

 President Xi Jinping on Wednesday held talks with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic on the second leg of his European tour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said his visit to Serbia will open a new chapter in bilateral ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president was greeted by Vucic outside the main government offices in central Belgrade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi arrived in Serbia on Tuesday evening from France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Wednesday, Xi will head to Hungary for a state visit marking 75 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an article published in the Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet, he noted that the upcoming visit would be his second to Hungary in 15 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president wrote that the two countries stood together in solidarity over the years amid challenges such as the global financial crisis and Covid-19.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past 75 years, China and Hungary have remained good partners for win-win cooperation. Focusing on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, our two countries are strengthening synergy in development strategies and deepening results-oriented cooperation in such areas as investment, infrastructure, finance, new energy, and telecommunication technology," the article read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our bilateral cooperation is strong, fruitful, and dynamic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi stressed the need for Beijing and Budapest to further boost friendship and cooperation and to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges. (Xinhua and agencies)

    Xi Jinping arrives in Serbia after lunch with Macron

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday evening, after French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a high altitude lunch at a childhood haunt in the Pyrenees mountains for the Chinese leader.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On the next step in his European tour, Xi will hold talks with President Aleksandar Vucic in Serbia, where China has invested heavily to expand its economic footprint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian state broadcaster RTS showed Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan descend from their Air China aeroplane to be greeted by Vucic, with a small crowd of welcomers waiting along a red carpet dressed in traditional clothing and holding flags and flowers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Serbia enjoy profound traditional friendship. Our bilateral relationship has stood the test of changing international environment and become a fine example of state-to-state relations," Xi said in a written statement issued by Xinhua news agency upon his arrival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said he looks forward to taking this visit as an opportunity to have in-depth exchange of views with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on bilateral relationship and other issues of mutual interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that this visit will be a fruitful one and will open up a new chapter in China-Serbia relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In France, Macron pressed a message to Beijing not to support Russia's war against Ukraine and to accept fairer trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the other two countries chosen by Xi for his first trip to Europe since 2019 – Hungary is his final stop after Serbia – are seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first day of Xi's state visit to France saw respectful but sometimes robust exchanges between the two presidents during a succession of talks on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron, joined initially by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its war with Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi, for his part, warned the West not to "smear" China over the conflict and also hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Serbian finance minister Sinisa Mali told the RTS broadcaster that talks on Wednesday would centre on "a great project." (Xinhua/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday continued his state visit to France by visiting the Pyrenees mountains, where he met his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Tarbes-Lourdes Pyrenees airport, Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, were greeted by Macron and his wife, Brigitte, who took them to lunch high up in the mountains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After watching traditional dancers perform under the snowy peaks, they ate locally grown ham, lamb, cheese and blueberry pie. Xi said he would give the ham some publicity and also praised the cheese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron gifted Xi a woollen blanket made in the Pyrenees, a Tour de France jersey and armagnac from the nearby southwestern region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Advisers to the French president described the Pyrenees trip as breaking with protocol for a chance for one-on-one chats with Xi in mountains dear to Macron as the birthplace of his maternal grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi has said he would welcome more high-level talks on trade frictions, and has denied there was a Chinese "overcapacity problem".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron has made trade a priority in the talks, underscoring that Europe must defend its "strategic interests" in its economic relations with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chinese and French companies had concluded some agreements on Monday ranging from energy, finance and transport on the sidelines of Xi's visit, but most were agreements to cooperate or renewed commitments to work together, and there were no significant deals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a sign of some progress, China will allow imports of pig origin protein feed as well as pork offal from France effective immediately, according to statements from Chinese customs and the French farm ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But European hopes of an Airbus plane order to coincide with Xi's visit appear to have been dashed, with the two sides agreeing only to expand co-operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi travels later on Tuesday to Serbia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing in Serbian daily Politika ahead of arriving in Belgrade, Xi criticised Nato for its "flagrant" bombing of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia in 1999, warning Beijing would "never allow such tragic history to repeat itself". (Reuters/AFP)

 Two people were dead and 21 wounded after a man went on a stabbing spree at a hospital in Yunnan province on Tuesday, local officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "A knife attack occurred at the Chengnan Hospital in Zhenxiong County, which resulted in two deaths and 21 injuries," a statement on the county's official WeChat account said.

 French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday thanked President Xi Jinping for backing his idea of a truce in all conflicts including Ukraine during the Paris Olympics this summer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I thank you for showing your desire during our talks to ask all parties to have an Olympic truce," Macron said at a joint press conference, adding that such a truce for "all theatres" of war could help achieve lasting peace in the conflicts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Ukraine, President Xi said China supports the convening of an international peace conference on the crisis at an appropriate time. He said the conference should be recognized by both Russia and Ukraine, with equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also said he would welcome President Macron to visit China again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi arrived in Paris on Sunday for a two-day visit.

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday attended a China-France-EU trilateral meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at the Elysee Palace in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said China regarded Europe as an important partner in helping it achieve its modernisation goals and said the two sides should stay committed to their partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president added China regarded Europe as a priority of its foreign policy, and sees China-EU relations from a strategic and long-term perspective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi's French counterpart, Macron, said the international situation made EU-China dialogue more essential than ever, adding it was important to ensure a level playing field between the two sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trade, Sino-European relations, the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East dominated talks between the three leaders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macron said coordination with Beijing on "major crises" including Ukraine was "absolutely decisive".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said China had been working "vigorously" to facilitate talks for peace in Ukraine while adding that Beijing was ready to work with the EU to support a more broad-based, authoritative and effective international peace conference to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On trade, Macron urged "fair rules for all" while the EU's von der Leyen said relations between Brussels and Beijing were challenged over issues linked to market access.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said whether viewed from the perspective of comparative advantage or global market demand, there was no such thing as "China's overcapacity problem". (Xinhua/Reuters)

  According to the National Immigration Administration, border inspection agencies across the country handled nearly 8.47 million entry and exit trips during the five-day holiday that ended on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a 35.1 percent increase year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the number of arrivals and departures peaked on May 3, with more than 1.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland travellers accounted for more than half of all the trips, at 4.77 million; people from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan made 2.92 million trips; and travellers from abroad accounted for the rest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed about 295 million domestic tourist trips were made during the May Day holiday, up 7.6 percent year on year and 28.2 percent from the same period in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said both inbound and outbound tourism have been recovering rapidly, due to the resumption of more air routes and introduction of measures to facilitate visitors' entry, among other factors (Reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sino-French relations over the past 60 years have been at the forefront of China's ties with major Western countries, setting a good example for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems, President Xi Jinping said on Sunday as he arrived in France for a state visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  French Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, met Xi at the airport at the start of his first visit to a European Union country in five years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written speech, Xinhua reported that Xi also described Sino-French relations as a model of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted the president as saying the development of China-France ties brings benefits to the two peoples and injected stability, positive energy into a turbulent world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi also said China was ready to consolidate traditional friendship, enhance political mutual trust, build strategic consensus and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields with France through the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi is expected to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen on his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his European visit, Xi will also visit Hungary and Serbia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Long March-5 rocket, carrying the Chang'e-6 spacecraft, blasted off from its launchpad at the Wenchang Space Launch Site in Hainan on Friday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 mission is tasked with collecting and returning samples from the moon's mysterious far side, the first endeavor of its kind in the history of human lunar exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Collecting and returning samples from the far side of the moon is an unprecedented feat. Now we know very little about the moon's far side. If the Chang'e-6 mission can achieve its goal, it will provide scientists with the first direct evidence to understand the environment and material composition of the far side of the moon, which is of great significance," said Wu Weiren, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of China's lunar exploration program.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 spacecraft, like its predecessor Chang'e-5, comprises an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After it reaches the moon, it will make a soft landing on the far side. Within 48 hours after landing, a robotic arm will be extended to scoop rocks and soil from the lunar surface, and a drill will bore into the ground. Scientific detection work will be carried out simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the samples are sealed in a container, the ascender will take off from the moon and dock with the orbiter in lunar orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner will then carry the samples back to Earth, landing in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The entire flight is expected to last about 53 days, the China National Space Administration said. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The death toll from a highway collapse in Guangdong province increased to 48 on Thursday, as President Xi Jinping called for the utmost efforts to save lives and eliminate dangers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Heavy rains caused a stretch of road running from Meizhou city towards Dabu county to cave in at around 2.10am on Wednesday, according to Xinhua news agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vehicles careened into the nearly 18-metre-long gash in the tarmac and plummeted down the steep slope below. The highway collapse had trapped over 20 vehicles, according to Xinhua.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media called the road collapse a "natural geological disaster" caused by the "impact of persistent heavy rain".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 500 people have been dispatched to help with the rescue operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported that Xi is highly concerned about the incident and gave important instructions on the rescue and relief work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said efforts should be made to repair the damaged roads and restore traffic order as soon as possible, and that all regions and relevant departments must strengthen monitoring and early warning, and ensure the safety of people's lives and property as well as overall social stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, massive downpours in a different part of the province sparked floods that claimed four lives and forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And a tornado killed five people when it ripped through Guangzhou last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With rainfall expected to intensify throughout May, the government has warned of possible further disasters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Multiparty discussions and evaluations indicate that strong convection and heavy precipitation may increase in China in May," Xinhua cited the emergency management ministry as saying. (Agencies)

 At least 24 people died after part of a highway collapsed due to heavy rains in Guangdong province on Wednesday, state media said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency said that a stretch of road between Meizhou city and Dabu county caved in at around 2.10am. The incident caused 20 vehicles to become trapped and involved a total of 54 people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 3pm, "24 people have been confirmed dead, and 30 are receiving all-out emergency care in hospital", Xinhua said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The news agency also said the incident did not involve any large vehicles or vehicles transporting hazardous chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An aerial photograph published by broadcaster CCTV showed wrecked vehicles lying in a deep muddy pit where the highway once ran, while dozens of emergency vehicles and cranes congregated along the intact section of the road, which bisects a steep, wooded slope. It reported that a nearly 18-metre stretch of road had fallen away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have dispatched around 500 people to the site to help with the rescue operation. They are drawn from departments handling public security, emergency response, firefighting and mining rescue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident is the latest in a string of disasters attributed to extreme weather events in Guangdong in recent weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Massive downpours last month sparked floods in a different part of the province that claimed the lives of four people and forced the evacuation of over 100,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on Wednesday conducted maiden sea trials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Fujian, the most advanced aircraft carrier yet, left Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard at about 8am to conduct trials to test the reliability and stability of its propulsion and electrical systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First shown to the public in June 2022, the Fujian was entirely designed and built domestically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aircraft carrier is larger and technologically more advanced than the Shandong, commissioned in 2019, and the Liaoning, which China bought second-hand from Ukraine and refitted domestically.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since its launch in June 2022, the Fujian has completed its mooring trials, outfitting work and equipment adjustments. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency has declared the Shenzhou-17 mission a complete success as its three crew members returned to Earth on Tuesday afternoon after their six-month mission in space.
 <br>
  <br>
   The agency said astronauts Tang Hongbo, Tang Shengjie and Jiang Xinlin were in good health conditions as they emerged from the spacecraft's return capsule that touched down at the Dongfeng landing site in Inner Mongolia.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang Hongbo, commander of the Shenzhou-17 mission and the first to step out of the capsule, thanked everyone for their support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I feel so proud of my country," he said. "Every time the spacecraft flew over the motherland, I always searched for my homeland with a sense of longing and pride."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang Shengjie described it as a dream come true, and said he can't wait for the next mission.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "For me, the six-month mission is a learning journey for me, and also a journey for exploration. I learned a lot; there is a vast universe and there's no end for me to continue to explore."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier on Tuesday, the Shenzhou-17 separated from the country's space station combination and started its journey back to Earth.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Before the separation, the Shenzhou-17 crew – with the assistance of the ground staff – completed various tasks such as setting the status of the space station combination and carried out handover work with the Shenzhou-18 crew.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Tang Hongbo has now accumulated a total of 279 days in space over the course of two missions, Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-17, setting a new record for the longest spaceflight by a Chinese astronaut.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Shenzhou-17 crew were launched to the Tiangong space station last October. The Shenzhou-18 was launched last week. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The third plenum of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will be held in Beijing in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That's in accordance with a decision made at a Politburo meeting on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the upcoming plenary session "will primarily study issues concerning further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping, who's also party general secretary, presided over the Politburo meeting, which also analysed the current economic situation and economic work, and discussed continuous efforts to advance the high-quality integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the meeting, "China's reform must continue in the face of complex international and domestic situations, a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial changes, and the new anticipation of the people," Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting said despite an economic rebound, challenges remained such as inadequate demand, operating pressure on enterprises and the risks facing key areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also stressed the need to respond to people's aspirations for quality homes and tackle a housing stockpile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has set a 2024 growth target of around 5 percent for the world's second-largest economy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace in April, an official factory survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting some loss of momentum for the sector at the start of the second quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 50.4 in April from 50.8 in March, above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and just ahead of a median forecast of 50.3 in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The data underlines the challenges facing policymakers even though solid first quarter GDP growth had reduced some of the urgency to ramp up stimulus measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New export orders grew at a much slower rate, while employment continued to shrink, the NBS's PMI data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, a private Caixin factory survey, which was also released on Tuesday, showed manufacturing activity grew more quickly as new export orders rose, providing a more optimistic outlook than the official data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investors expect Beijing to launch more stimulus to support the economy and were waiting for the outcome of a politburo meeting, which is expected to focus on economic affairs this month. (Reuters)

 The Foreign Ministry on Monday announced that President Xi Jinping will pay state visits to France, Serbia and Hungary from May 5-10.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the French government, Xi is due to make a state visit to France on May 6-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bilateral relations with Paris have maintained sound growth momentum, and both countries have had strategic communications and practical cooperation, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said in discussing the president's trip to France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China looks forward to working with France to further enhance political mutual trust, solidarity and cooperation," Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be Xi's first European tour since the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This visit takes place on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries and follows on from the president's visit to Beijing and Guangzhou in April 2023," French President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Exchanges will focus on international crises, first and foremost the war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East, trade issues, scientific, cultural and sporting cooperation," the Elysee office said. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mainland-based political commentator says relations between China and the United States have improved, but both countries need to work together to resolve conflicts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, was commenting after President Xi Jinping said China and the US should be partners, not rivals, during his meeting with visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, I mean it's better than it was last year at this time. There's at least communication going on. There's more planned communication. It's very important, you have to keep talking especially when you have global tensions like this. There are so many issues that need to be tackled," he said, while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tangen said that, although the Biden administration would most likely continue to see China as a threat, this wasn't the case for business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Business interests are very interested in cooperating and this is a kind of a medium term situation," he said. "You have Elon Musk coming to China."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, made an unannounced visit to Beijing, where he was expected to discuss the roll-out of Full Self-Driving software and permission to transfer data overseas, the Reuters news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media said Musk had met Premier Li Qiang, who said Tesla's development in China could be regarded as a successful example of US-China economic and trade cooperation.

    Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Moves to boost mainland business, skilled staff travel" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750907_1_20240428151400.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The central government on Sunday announced measures to facilitate visits by mainland business representatives and skilled workers to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, mainland residents holding Business Visit Endorsements will be permitted to stay in Hong Kong for up to 14 days, starting from May 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainlanders who wish to travel to Hong Kong for business purposes are required to obtain an exit endorsement for business visit from the mainland authorities, and at the moment they're allowed to stay here for up to one week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities also announced that mainland residents can apply for the travel document at any relevant offices across the country, regardless of the applicant's place of household registration or place of residence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing, Wang Ling from the National Immigration Administration said the change can benefit more than 100 million business entities across the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This change aims to better meet the needs of long-term business activity and to support business professionals in seeking opportunities and conducting in-depth business negotiations. According to our preliminary estimates, the new policy is expected to benefit over 100 million businesses and more than 30,000 enterprises and institutions that have registered and applied for multiple Business Visit Endorsements," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said they will extend the multiple-entry visas for skilled workers to visit Hong Kong and Macau which currently applies only to Greater Bay Area residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From May 6, eligible talent from Beijing and Shanghai will too be able to apply for the visa to visit the two SARs, with each stay limited to 30 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun thanked the central government for the new measures, saying they would help the SAR to attract talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two new measures will facilitate Hong Kong's further integration into the national development and achieve concrete results on the solid policy foundation of facilitating the 'southbound and northbound' two-way flow of talents," a government spokesperson added in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said the SAR government will continue to promote talent exchange with the mainland authorities, to create a stronger drive for growth in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the scheme involving skilled workers may be extended to more mainland cities in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It depends on the implementation. We have the potential to have these arrangements further expanded to other cities, especially those cities with closer business connections with Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the central government will look at the actual situation and decide whether to expand or not."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who's also general manager of the artificial intelligence firm SenseTime Hong Kong, said the new measures would enhance the SAR's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Singapore already provides visa-free to mainland China, right?... Hong Kong needs to be more attractive. So, today the scheme has some benefits for Beijing and Shanghai citizens. That's good for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang added that the new measures would make it more convenient to do business in Hong Kong, as mainland business travellers are allowed to stay longer in the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Drivers in mainland China who trade in an old car for a newer model are eligible for a subsidy of up to 10,000 yuan (HK$10,800), the commerce ministry has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China is the world's biggest market for cars, and the most competitive in the electric vehicle sector, with more than 100 homegrown companies racing to make the clean car of the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To boost demand, Beijing is offering the subsidy to drivers who trade in an electric or hybrid vehicle registered before 2018, or a gasoline-powered car that doesn't meet certain national emissions standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who replace a vehicle purchased after 2018 will be eligible for a subsidy of 7,000 yuan, the commerce ministry said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measure, in force until the end of the year, applies to all purchases of new electric or hybrid vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its announcement coincides with the China Auto Show, where Chinese brands are stealing the show from foreign manufacturers struggling to make the transition to electric vehicles. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping said there was reason for optimism in the development of China-US relations as he met America's top diplomat in Beijing on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to state media, the president told Antony Blinken that progress had been made over the past few months in stabilising ties between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi said the two nations should be "partners, not rivals", and should seek common ground while reserving differences and avoid descending into vicious competition, adding: "there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, and there is still room for further efforts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said that "China would be pleased to see a confident and open, prosperous and developing United States".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the US can also take a positive view of China's development," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When this fundamental problem is solved... relations can truly stabilise, get better, and move forward." (Reuters/AFP)

    ByteDance says 'no plans' to sell TikTok

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese tech giant ByteDance has said it has no plans to sell TikTok after a new US law put it on a deadline to divest from the hugely popular video platform or have it banned in the United States.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tech publication, The Information, earlier reported that ByteDance is exploring scenarios for selling TikTok's US business without the algorithm that recommends videos to TikTok users. ByteDance denied it was considering a sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Foreign media reports about ByteDance exploring the sale of TikTok are untrue," the company posted on Thursday on Toutiao, a Chinese-language platform it owns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "ByteDance does not have any plans to sell TikTok."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok's CEO Shou Zi Chew said on Wednesday the social media company expects to win a legal challenge to block legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden that he said would ban its popular short video app used by 170 million Americans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill, passed overwhelmingly by the US Senate on Tuesday, is driven by widespread worries among US lawmakers that China could access Americans' data or use the app for surveillance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden's signing sets a January 19 deadline for a sale – one day before his term is poised to expire – but he could extend the deadline by three months if he determines privately owned ByteDance is making progress. (AFP/Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday met US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks across a range of complex issues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top US diplomat is due to spend several hours with Wang across closed-door meetings at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and a working lunch as the two sides try to maintain progress in ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the pair settled into their opening session, Wang told Blinken that the "great ship" of the China-US relationship had stabilised, "but negative factors in the relationship are still increasing and building".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the relationship is facing all kinds of disruptions. China’s legitimate development rights have been unreasonably suppressed and our core interests are facing challenges," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken replied that "active diplomacy" was needed to move forward with the agenda set by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when they met in San Francisco in November.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's no substitute in our judgement for face-to-face diplomacy," Blinken said, adding that he wanted to ensure that "we’re as clear as possible about the areas where we have differences, at the very least to avoid misunderstandings, to avoid miscalculations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  US State Department officials signalled ahead of the sessions that China's support for Russia would feature strongly, saying that Washington is prepared to act against Chinese companies that have been helping retool and resupply Russia's defence industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chinese officials and state media have cast doubt over the extent of possible progress on several fronts, with a China Daily editorial saying that both sides "have been largely talking past each other".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the conflict in Ukraine, the world can see it clearly that the Ukraine issue is not an issue between China and the US; and the US side should not turn it into one," it said. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's latest Shenzhou-18 manned space mission blasted off on Thursday, with three astronauts making their way to the Tiangong space station in the early hours of Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rocket, carrying astronauts Ye Guangfu, Li Cong and Li Guangsu, took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the northwest province of Gansu at 8.59pm. Xinhua reported that the crew completed their docking at about 3.30am and were able to board a couple of hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Lipeng, the centre's director, declared the launch mission a complete success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Long March-2F Y18 rocket has sent Shenzhou-18 manned spaceship to the intended orbit accurately... I hereby announce that Shenzhou-18 has been launched successfully," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trio will stay in orbit for six months, during which they will carry out more than 90 experiments in the fields of basic physics in microgravity, space material and life science, space medicine and space technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will create an "aquarium" and raise zebrafish and algae in zero gravity, to study how the space environment affects their growth and the aquatic ecosystem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crew will also cultivate plants in an experiment to help with designing crops that adapt to outer space conditions. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday called on China and the United States to manage their relationship "responsibly" as he went on a charm offensive in Shanghai, ahead of talks with top central government officials in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken's visit to Shanghai has seen him sample local food, watch a basketball game and stroll along the city's famous Bund promenade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a meeting with Chen Jining, Communist Party Secretary of Shanghai, America's top diplomat said US President Joe Biden was committed to "direct and sustained" dialogue between the world's two largest economies after years of mounting tension.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have an obligation for our people, indeed an obligation to the world, to manage the relationship between our two countries responsibly," Blinken said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is the obligation we have, and one that we take very seriously.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen too stressed the need to build stable ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whether we choose cooperation or confrontation affects the well-being of both peoples, both countries and the future of humanity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken on Thursday also met students at the Shanghai campus of New York University, where he voiced hope for more Americans to study in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the US was committed to welcoming Chinese students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken also met American business leaders in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He then headed for Beijing, where he's expected to meet Foreign Minister Wang Yi and possibly President Xi Jinping on Friday. (AFP & agencies)

    Expert not optimistic about US-China links

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, is due to meet business leaders in Shanghai on Thursday, the second day of a three-day visit to China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken is due to wrap up his visit in Beijing on Friday, with talks with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and possibly President Xi Jinping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite an increase in contacts between China and the US recently - including a summit between President Xi and President Joe Biden - a Shanghai-based expert says he's pessimistic about the future of relations between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I remain a pessimist. I've been a pessimist on US-China relations since the Alaska meetings that took place shortly after Biden took office. I was hopeful that we would see a significant improvement after the Trump years," Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics at East China Normal University, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very concerned that Trump may be re-elected. I think a lot of people in the world are concerned about that. But whether he's re-elected or not, you know, if Biden is re-elected or Trump, I think we all anticipate that things are going to continue to get worse," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mahoney stressed there were some areas where both countries must work together - in their own best interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's clear that they have to cooperate on some very basic issues," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These included the global financial system "because both countries depend on that substantially, not only for their own bilateral trade, but for the global trade system as a whole", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If China doesn't go along with the dollar or the way that the system works from the US point of view, then that threatens the US economy as well. So there is some shared concern there. We've also heard reports that they might be discussing other issues that won't be well-publicised, perhaps including militarisation in space," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said issues like climate change and increased cooperation seem to have "slipped far from the conversation, despite it being a growing existential concern" for both sides.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in China for a three-day visit as the two countries try to keep relations on an even keel amid differences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Blinken landed in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon where he will meet students and business leaders. He'll later head to Beijing and hold talks with top Chinese officials there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides are expected to discuss issues such as Ukraine, regional peace and stability, and fentanyl.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Blinken's second visit to China in less than a year, following up on recent phone talks between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua News Agency noted that bilateral ties have begun to stabilise since the two leaders met in San Francisco last November, with significant exchanges in various fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains committed to open dialogue and communication with the United States. However, Washington must recognise that dialogue must be based on equality and respect, and actions must align with words," Xinhua said. (Agencies)

    China slams US military aid package to Taiwan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has condemned the latest package of US military assistance to Taiwan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The US Senate on Tuesday passed US$95 billion in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The package included US$8 billion for the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, the Taiwan Affairs Office said the aid seriously violates US commitments to China and sends a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Taiwan issue is purely China’s internal affair and does not tolerate any external interference," spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said US military support for the island only increased the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'd like to emphasise that the United States and Taiwan strengthening military ties will not bring about security for Taiwan," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will only increase tensions and the risk of conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and will ultimately be an act of shooting oneself in the foot." (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

    China introduces fresh crew for Tiangong space station

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The China Manned Space Agency on Wednesday introduced the crew for the Shenzhou-18 mission, the latest in a programme that aims to send astronauts to the Moon by 2030.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trio of astronauts will be led by Ye Guangfu, a fighter pilot and veteran astronaut who took part in the Shenzhou-13 mission in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye, along with Li Cong and Li Guangsu are scheduled to blast off at 8.59pm local time on Thursday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. They will relieve the Shenzhou-17 team who are currently on the Tiangong space station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Jiuquan, Ye said the mission will be a special one.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very special time and also carries special meaning. During the mission this time in China's space station, we will celebrate China's 75th anniversary of its founding and today is also China's ninth Space Day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ye also stressed that China believes in international collaboration when it comes to space exploration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For us, we all actually pursue our dream to establish a space station, explore space, and also to make contributions. I believe we'll make great contributions to build a community of shared future for mankind.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also sincerely invite our international peers to explore the vast universe together and to create a better future for mankind with joint efforts, and a China space station you can always look up to."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tiangong is the crown jewel of Beijing's space programme – which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon – and made China the third country to put humans in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new crew will replace the Shenzhou-17 team, who were sent to the station in October, and stay in orbit for six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhou-17 crew is scheduled to return to Earth on April 30. (Additional reporting by AFP and Xinhua)

    Bill to ban TikTok in US clears Congress
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="TikTok says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750299_1_20240424111040.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The US Senate voted late on Tuesday by a wide margin to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest TikTok's US operations within about nine months or face a ban.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measure was passed by the US House of Representatives on Saturday and Biden said he would sign it into law on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share US user data with Beijing, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the US free speech rights of its users.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favour of the bill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2020, then-President Donald Trump was blocked by the courts in his bid to block TikTok and WeChat in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new legislation, however, is likely to give the Biden administration stronger legal footing to ban TikTok if ByteDance fails to divest the app, experts say. It also gives the White House new tools to ban or force the sale of other foreign-owned apps it deems to be security threats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has described the proposed US ban on TikTok as unfair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said last month there is "no fairness to speak of" in citing national security to reduce the competitive advantage of other countries. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China condemned on Tuesday what it called "groundless accusations" by the United States that Beijing is supporting Russia's war in Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The United States has unveiled a large-scale aid bill for Ukraine while also making groundless accusations against normal trade between China and Russia," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of approach is extremely hypocritical and utterly irresponsible, and China is firmly opposed to it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang reiterated that China has consistently maintained that it is a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the Ukraine issue, China has always maintained an objective and just position, advocated actively for peace talks and pushed for a political resolution," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Beijing will not accept others "passing the buck" or shifting the blame. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rescue operations were underway after unseasonably heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides in Yingde city in flood-ravaged Guangdong province, broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes as the latest figures showed that four people have died as a result of the heavy rain, and 10 others are still missing. Provincial authorities have relocated some 110,000 residents so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescue and emergency workers were seen tending to stranded residents on rescue boats in residential areas as well as commercial streets, in video aired by CCTV. The broadcaster also reported emergency supplies including food, water and other amenities were being provided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one village, farmers stood at a flooded intersection along with belongings they managed to save, including a washing machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everything's gone, all the seedlings are gone," said Huang Jingrong, 61.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's all flooded, flooded beyond repair," he said, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, massive flooding has occurred in Beijiang River in the Pearl River basin on Monday due to the continuous heavy rain, according to the Ministry of Water Resources.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall since Thursday, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the region's annual flooding season. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    No systemic Chinese doping, says Australian swim coach

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell says China is adamant about clean sport. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749950_1_20240422120145.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Australian swimming coach Denis Cotterell has rejected allegations of orchestrated doping in Chinese swimming, saying China is adamant about clean sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cotterell is working with China's top swimmers in the lead-up to the Paris Olympics and previously coached 1,500 metres freestyle world record holder Sun Yang, who is now suspended for a doping offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirmed reports over the weekend that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a banned drug before the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said it had accepted China's findings that the results were due to contamination and decided against appealing the matter, triggering criticism from top swimmers and the US anti-doping authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell told the Sydney Morning Herald he stood by his swimmers "100%" and said any positive test results in Chinese swimming were not part of a state-run programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am happy to say I’m absolutely in support of my swimmers and dispute any suggestion of anything orchestrated," Cotterell said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suggestion that it's systemic is so far from anything I have seen here the whole time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are so adamant on having clean sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's sad to see what this suggests or looks like. It’s unfortunate for everyone. I feel for the athletes here because of how hard they work now to eliminate the tag that was garnered in the '90s."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading coaches and swimmers criticised WADA and China's anti-doping authority over the weekend and questioned why the 23 swimmers' test results were not made public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cotterell said he understood if rival swimmers were upset and that the process could have been better handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It unfortunately allows that doubt to come out and to surface. I can’t prove anything, I just know the truth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he was also insistent that failed drug tests from contaminated food was a consistent risk in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "(Swimmers) are not allowed to eat outside anywhere. When they go on a plane, they can’t eat the food," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Media reports said the swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine (TMZ), which is found in heart medication, months before the Tokyo Games started in July 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said after reviewing a television documentary and newspaper reports that it stands by its decision to clear the 23 swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-doping agency issued a statement on Sunday following the release of a documentary on the cases by German broadcaster ARD.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an earlier statement following initial newspaper reports, WADA said it agreed with Chinese authorities and ruled that the swimmers’ samples had been contaminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New York Times reported that Chinese anti-doping authorities found the results of the tests were Adverse Analytical Findings but cleared the swimmers without any penalties after finding that the samples were flagged as positive as a result of contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Following WADA’s review of the documentary, the agency still stands firmly by the results of its scientific investigation and legal decision concerning the case,” WADA said in the statement on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are equally confident that WADA’s independent Intelligence and Investigations Department followed up on all allegations received, which were not corroborated by any evidence; and thus, did not meet WADA threshold to open an investigation.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WADA said based on available scientific evidence and intelligence, “which was gathered, assessed and tested by experts in the pharmacology of trimetazidine (TMZ); and, by anti-doping experts,” it had no basis under the global anti-doping code to challenge the Chinese agency's findings of environmental contamination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry on Monday called reports about the swimmers testing positive "fake news".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe you will also have noted that the World Anti-Doping Agency has put out a very clear response," spokesman Weng Wenbin told a regular briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an in-depth and detailed investigation of this incident by the China anti-doping centre in 2021, it was determined that the relevant athletes had ingested contaminated drugs without their knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chinese swimmers involved were neither at fault nor guilty of negligence, and their behaviour did not constitute a doping violation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After an investigation, WADA affirmed the findings of the China anti-doping centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing has a zero-tolerance position towards doping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We strictly adhere to the (relevant) global provisions and resolutely protect the physical and mental health of athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We uphold fair competition in sports events and have made active contributions to the global fight against doping," he said. (Agencies)

 Authorities in Guangdong on Monday said four people were killed and 10 people were missing after continuous heavy rainfall hit many parts of the province over the past few days.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three deaths were reported in Zhaoqing City, while the remaining one is a rescuer in Shaoguan City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong's provincial emergency management department said search and rescue operations were still underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The heavy rain affected many cities including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, resulting in damaged houses, blocked roads and landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it has so far relocated some 110,000 residents, with 25,800 people being urgently resettled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scores of homes either collapsed or were badly damaged, resulting in an economic loss of over 110 million yuan according to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rainfall was forecast to continue over the coming three days across the southern regions, with rainstorms hitting parts of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, the National Meteorological Centre said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Persistent heavy rain has affected south China since April 19, with precipitation reaching record highs in several areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vast regions of the country's south and southwest were expected to see a 50 to 80 percent increase in precipitation in late April compared with the same period in previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said due to the heavy rain, water levels in 44 rivers within the Pearl River basin had exceeded warning levels as of April 21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China issued a yellow alert for rainstorms on Monday morning, the third most severe level in the country's four-tier, colour-coded weather warning system. (Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Xie Feng said the Chinese and US sides had continued to work together in a number of areas. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749928_1_20240422092116.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's ambassador to the United States said on Saturday that the two countries need to keep working to improve relations amid "unprecedented challenges".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xie Feng made the comments at Harvard University ahead of a visit to Beijing this week by the top US diplomat, Antony Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether the younger generation can continue to enjoy the eight-decade-long peace and development as their parents did depends largely on whether China and the United States can find the right way to get along in the new era,” Xie said in comments released by the embassy on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xie said talks in California between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart, Joe Biden, in November had injected stability into the bilateral relationship and also formed a forward-looking “San Francisco vision”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Since the meeting, the two sides have maintained interactions at various levels, and conducted dialogue and cooperation in areas including foreign policy, economy and trade, law enforcement, agriculture, and [military to military] relations,” Xie was quoted by the embassy as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ambassador acknowledged that there was competition between the two sides and said China would not shy away from such competition as long as it was fair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He rejected as unfair US claims that China’s lead in areas such as electric vehicles and solar panels was a result of overcapacity, and criticised the US insistence that other countries ban exports of certain products to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken arrives in Beijing on Wednesday for three days of talks that are expected to cover the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as bilateral ties.

    'Once a century' floods to hit southern China: CCTV

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Landslides in southern China injured at least six people and trapped others, state media reported on Sunday, as the region braced for severe floods "seen around once a century."
 <br>
  <br/>
  Torrential downpours across swathes of Guangdong province since Thursday have swollen rivers in the Pearl River Delta and triggered deluges in mountainous areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday that rains had sparked landslides affecting six villages in the northern Guangdong town of Jiangwan, "causing people to become trapped."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photographs published by CCTV showed waterfront homes destroyed by a wall of brown mud, and people in fluorescent-coloured ponchos sheltering in a soaked public sports court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No deaths were immediately reported and the total number of trapped people was not specified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But CCTV said six people who were "trapped and injured" in the landslides had been airlifted to the nearby city of Shaoguan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency workers were racing to restore communications to the stricken area "as soon as possible," CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that more than 80 rescuers were working "through the day and night" to assist people in the disaster zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Pearl River Delta is China's manufacturing heartland and one of the country's most densely populated regions, with Guangdong alone home to around 127 million people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aerial footage by CCTV on Sunday showed murky flood-waters lapping close to street level in some towns, leaving riverside promenades and pavilions inundated and a pagoda protruding from the deluge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have launched a level-two emergency response in the Pearl River Delta, the second-highest in a four-tier system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national weather office imposed weather alerts across central Guangdong and warned of major storms in coastal areas through Sunday evening and into Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the provincial hydrology bureau, CCTV said three monitored locations in the Bei River basin would "experience flooding seen around once a century... due to the impact of heavy precipitation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Floods of up to 5.8 metres above the warning limit would strike the areas starting early on Monday morning, according to CCTV.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other monitored tributaries in the basin would endure the kind of floods seen once every 50 years, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were no initial reports of mass evacuations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parts of the neighbouring provinces of Jiangxi and Fujian were also forecast to see severe rainstorms. (AFP)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Red Bull Racing's Dutch driver Max Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.66 seconds to cap a perfect day at the Shanghai International Circuit, in Shanghai.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Triple world champion Max Verstappen took pole position on Saturday for the Chinese Grand Prix, 0.322 seconds ahead of Red Bull teammate Sergio Perez with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso third.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Verstappen clocked a fastest lap of 1 minute and 33.660 seconds to cap a perfect day after earlier winning the sprint race at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lando Norris will start on the second row in his McLaren alongside Alonso for Sunday's race, the first grand prix to be held in China since 2019 because of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Oscar Piastri was fifth fastest in the second McLaren ahead of the Ferrari pair of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, with George Russell's Mercedes eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was a dominant day for the Dutchman who overcame electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the morning sprint, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The win increased his championship lead over teammate Perez to 25 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Hamilton's joy at coming second in the sprint turned to despair in the first qualifying stint when the Englishman locked up near the end of his final flying lap, relegating him to only 18th fastest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Max Verstappen overcame early electrical gremlins to blast from fourth on the grid to an emphatic victory in the Chinese Grand Prix sprint race on Saturday, 13 seconds ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Dutchman charged past the seven-time world champion Hamilton's Mercedes on lap nine of the 19-lap dash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez was third after a thrilling battle with the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz, and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first few laps were hectic," said Verstappen after claiming the eight points on offer for the winner of the first sprint of the season at the Shanghai International Circuit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The wind is changing a lot which makes it difficult to drive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once we sorted (the battery) out we were OK," Verstappen added as he extended his championship lead to 25 points over Perez.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leclerc and Sainz ended up fourth and fifth after swapping places numerous times in the dramatic tussle for the minor places with Perez and Alonso.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aston Martin's Alonso came out worst as he went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris, having to retire his car on lap 18 with a puncture suffered in the skirmish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the first Chinese Grand Prix weekend since 2019, huge crowds turned out to see Shanghai native Zhou Guanyu, China's first Formula One driver, make his home debut in his third season in the premier racing class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for Sunday's main race sold out in minutes and fans had plenty to cheer Friday when Zhou propelled his Sauber into the top 10 in a wet sprint qualifying session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He started from 10th and in dry conditions for the race and moved up one place after the opening skirmishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhou agonisingly finished just out of the points in ninth after being passed late on by Russell, who started down in 11th on the grid but made the most of starting on quicker soft tyres. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The top three in Sunday's Beijing half marathon have been stripped of their medals, organisers said, following an investigation into the finish that saw China's He Jie controversially win.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Today the 2024 Beijing Half Marathon Organising Committee issued a decision on the investigation and handling of the men's race results," a state media report said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "The trophies, medals and bonuses will be recovered."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race's bizarre finish saw He cross the line first after two runners from Kenya and one from Ethiopia seemed to deliberately allow him to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All four were "punished" and their results cancelled, CCTV reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chinese Athletics Association said earlier this week they had met, issuing a statement vowing to make improvements to the sport in the country. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland immigration authorities on Thursday said the country saw a total of more than 141 million inbound and outbound trips in the first quarter of this year, up 117 percent from the same period last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nearly 60 million of the trips were made by residents of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, up 100 percent year-on-year. Thirteen million trips were made by foreign nationals, which was triple the number last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Immigration Administration (NIA) noted that a number of measures were introduced to boost cross-border travel in the first three months of the year, including visa-free entry policies with some foreign countries, as well as the individual visit scheme for residents of Qingdao and Xi’an to travel to Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it granted 1.98 million foreign travellers visa-free entry during the period, up over 260 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NIA spokesperson Lin Yongsheng said the trend of residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan heading to the mainland is continuing, as is the trend of mainlanders heading to Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such traffic has resumed to the level seen in 2019, Lin said, with record breaking daily cross-border trips made at various ports in Hong Kong. (Additional reporting by Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Indonesia want to maintain peace and stability in the region, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday after holding talks with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Jakarta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang stressed the need to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marsudi said the two countries would strengthen relations, and said Jakarta was looking to deepen cooperation and investment in energy transition, infrastructure and the downstreaming industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also called for all parties in the Gaza conflict to exercise restraint, and said the United States should support a United Nations resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both ministers expressed resentment over the humanitarian disaster due to the Palestine-Israel conflict. We agree that the UN Security Council resolution on a ceasefire must be fully implemented and without any condition," Wang said after the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang is on an official visit to Indonesia, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea from April 18 to 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry has said he will chair the fourth meeting of the China-Indonesia High-Level Dialogue Cooperation Mechanism and the seventh meeting of the China-Cambodia Intergovernmental Coordination Committee during the trip. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    China slams Biden calls for hikes in steel tariffs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="In a speech addressing steelworkers in Pittsburgh, US President Joe Biden accuses steel companies in China of cheating. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749405_1_20240418111247.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese Embassy in the United States has criticised proposals by US President Joe Biden to impose higher tariffs on Chinese metal products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the embassy, Liu Pengyu, said "the US is making the same mistake again and again" by seeking higher tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, he also dismissed levies already in place as “the embodiment of unilateralism and protectionism of the US”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biden on Wednesday called for sharply higher American tariffs on Chinese metal products as part of a package of policies aimed at pleasing steelworkers in the swing state of Pennsylvania.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As he campaigned for re-election in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Biden aides said he was proposing raising to 25 percent the tariffs imposed by his predecessor Donald Trump on certain Chinese steel and aluminium products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China's steel companies don't need to worry about making a profit," Biden said. "They're not competing, they're cheating and we've seen the damage here in America."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington is also pressuring neighbouring Mexico to prohibit China from selling its metal products to the US indirectly from there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Biden administration is launching an investigation into Chinese trade practices across the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors, which could lead to more tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commerce Ministry said the “US petition is full of false accusations.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It ”misinterprets normal trade and investment activities as damaging to US national security and corporate interests," the ministry said in a statement. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence Minister Dong Jun has spoken with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, the first engagement the defence chiefs of the two countries have had in more than a year as Beijing and Washington seek to restore military ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry cited Dong as telling Austin on the phone that China and the US should explore ways to "get along" and "gradually accumulate mutual trust" by building a "non-conflict, non-confrontation", pragmatic and cooperative relationship between their militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong also said the US should recognise Beijing's position on the South China Sea, and respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests there. He also stressed that the Taiwan issue is "core of China's core interests".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and the US should... take peace as the most precious, stability as the most important," Dong told Austin, according to a ministry readout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The military sphere is the key... to stabilising the development of the relationship and preventing major crises from occurring," Dong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Austin "underscored the importance of respect for high seas freedom of navigation guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea", according to the Pentagon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US said the two also discussed the Ukraine war, North Korea, and Washington's commitment to the one China policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The phone call comes as President Xi Jinping and his counterpart, Joe Biden, have sought to manage tensions; the two leaders last year agreed to resume direct military talks. (Reuters/AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Tuesday told visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that China and Germany should be vigilant against rising protectionism and view the issue of production capacity objectively.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi said the industrial and supply chains of the two countries are deeply intertwined and their markets highly interdependent, and that co-operation was not a "risk" but a guarantee for stable ties and an opportunity for the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must view and develop bilateral relations in an all-round way from a long-term and strategic perspective," the president said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Scholz arrived in China on Sunday for a three-day visit, his first since his government launched a "de-risking" strategy last year to avoid relying excessively on Chinese suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also coincided with European Union concerns about the threat to European businesses from Chinese goods, including electric vehicles and other green technologies, flooding its markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to students at Tongji University in Shanghai on Monday, Scholz called for fair competition in trade relations with China, while urging the EU not to act out of protectionist self-interest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his meeting with Xi, Scholz also touched on areas where he said the two countries could cooperate, including climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two leaders also discussed Ukraine, with Xi proposing four principles to prevent the crisis from spiralling out of control and to restore peace at an early date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First, we should prioritise the upholding of peace and stability and refrain from seeking selfish gains. Second, we should cool down the situation and not add fuel to the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Third, we need to create conditions for the restoration of peace and refrain from further exacerbating tensions. Fourth, we should reduce the negative impact on the world economy and refrain from undermining the stability of global industrial and supply chains," Xi said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy grew 5.3 percent in the first quarter year-on-year, official data showed on Tuesday, comfortably beating analysts' expectations, a welcome sign for policymakers as they try to shore up demand and confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters news agency had expected first-quarter gross domestic product to expand 4.6 percent from a year earlier, compared to 5.2 percent in the previous three months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sheng Laiyun, National Bureau of Statistics deputy commissioner, said the nation had made solid progress over the period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally, in the first quarter, the national economy made a good start, accumulating positive factors and laying a solid foundation for achieving the annual goal," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, we should say that there are rising complexities and uncertainties in the external environment," he said, adding that authorities will boost economic vitality, prevent and diffuse risks, as well as enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mainland officials are aiming for economic growth of around five percent for 2024, a target that many analysts believe is ambitious and may require more stimulus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, retail sales and industrial production in China slowed in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales growth slowed to 3.1 percent year-on-year in March, down from a 5.5 percent increase in the first two months of 2024, while industrial production rose 4.5 percent, down from a 7 percent increase in the first two months, official data showed. (Reuters/AFP)
