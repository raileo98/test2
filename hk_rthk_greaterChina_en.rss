 Chinese pair Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha captured the gold medal for the table tennis mixed doubles event at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday, after defeating Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong of North Korea 4-2 in the final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The top-seeded Chinese duo, who won the 2021 and 2023 World championships, beat their North Korean opponents 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-5, 7-11 and 11-8 at the South Paris Arena 4.

  The bronze medal was won by South Korean paddlers Lim Jong-hoon and Shin Yu-bin who beat Wong Chun-ting and Doo Hoi-kem from Hong Kong, China 4-0 earlier in the day. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese leaders signalled on Tuesday that the stimulus measures needed to reach this year's economic growth target will be directed at consumers, pointing to a "batch of incremental policy steps" to boost domestic demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Politburo pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a "proactive" fiscal policy, and reiterated the need for a "prudent" monetary framework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency reported "the meeting stressed that it is necessary to focus on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand, and the focus of economic policy should be more to benefit people's livelihood and promote consumption".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said policies should increase residents' income "through multiple channels" and enhance the "ability and willingness" of low- and middle-income groups to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said economic measures should improve elderly and childcare, and "weave a dense and solid social security net".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No specific steps were announced, but the leadership gave instructions for a "timely launch [of] a batch of incremental policy measures".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also warned that "adverse effects brought about by current changes in the external environment are increasing", while there are "many risks and hidden dangers in key areas".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have announced various measures in recent months to boost the economy. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese men's gymnastic team took home silver at the Paris Olympics in the early hours of Tuesday, as two falls from one of the gymnasts in the final round proved to be too costly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japan took gold on 259.594 points, a little more than half a point ahead of China. The United States got bronze.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China led by more than three points heading into the final round, with Xiao Ruoteng, Su Weide and Zhang Boheng up on the horizontal bar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su slipped and lost his grip on the bar twice in his routine, for a subpar score of 11.6. Zhang was unable to make up for the deficit in the last routine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China had taken the lead after the first three rotations, with exceptional performances on the rings, led by Tokyo Olympic gold medallist Liu Yang, and strong scores on the horse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan and Zhang then extended the advantage with slick moves on the parallel bars, with Zou getting 16 points on the apparatus, the highest individual score in the entire event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Su had a night to forget as his slips also meant the chance at gold faded away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Japanese themselves had to overcome a poor start to the competition to capture gold in the end.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China snatched bronzes in the same event at both the Tokyo and Rio Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Sheng Lihao claimed the Paris Olympic title in the men's 10m air rifle event on Monday, adding to his victory in the 10m air rifle mixed team event along with Huang Yuting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sheng, the silver medalist from Tokyo, set an Olympic record with a score of 252.2 points at the Chateauroux Shooting Center.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm quite satisfied with my performance at the Paris Olympics. As you could see, I encountered some difficulties during the competitions, but I managed to hold myself together and complete them," Sheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lindgren of Sweden claimed silver with 251.4 points. He came from behind to eliminate Miran Maricic of Croatia by 0.5 points through the second shot of the penultimate series, scoring 10.6 to Maricic's 9.9.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite finishing first in Sunday's qualification round, the 19-year-old Sheng was not at his best, scoring 631.7 points, which is 6.2 points lower than his own world record.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he responded with a strong start in the final and dominated after three series in the elimination stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two perfect 10.9 shots gave him a 2-point advantage over second-placed Arjun Babuta of India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although Sheng's lead diminished to 0.6 points before the final series against Lindgren due to two sub-10 shots, he managed a 10.5 and a 10.6 to secure victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the third shooting gold for China at Paris 2024 from five events, and the country's fifth gold overall. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni vowed on Sunday to "relaunch" cooperation with China, signing a three-year action plan during her first official visit to Beijing since taking office, Italian news agency ANSA reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meloni made the announcement during a meeting with Premier Li Qiang, as Rome seeks to improve trade ties with Beijing after it exited the Belt and Road infrastructure investment scheme last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian leader said her five-day trip was a "demonstration of the will to begin a new phase, to relaunch our bilateral cooperation", ANSA reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The action plan will aim to experiment with new forms of cooperation, she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meloni, who sees Chinese investment as a way to spur Italy's anaemic economic growth, will meet President Xi Jinping and National People's Congress Standing Committee chairman Zhao Leji.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also attended an Italy-China business forum, to which companies including Italian tyre-maker Pirelli, energy group ENI, defence group Leonardo, wine producers and several Italian luxury fashion groups such as Dolce & Gabbana were invited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forum gives "another signal of the mutual interest... (to) balance more our interests, our commercial exchange," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and Italy should adopt a win-win mentality and increase trade and investment cooperation, making cooperation even more dynamic and sustainable," said Premier Li at the opening of the forum, according to a video shared by Meloni's office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bilateral trade and industrial agreements are expected to be signed during Meloni's trip, a source close to the planning has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2019, Italy became the only Group of Seven country to join the massive Belt and Road Initiative but withdrew last year under US pressure over concerns about Beijing's economic reach. (Reuters)

  Another Italian, Paolo Monna, took bronze.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China shaded Japan in men's artistic gymnastics qualifying at the Paris Olympics on Saturday, with all-around leader Zhang Boheng hailing his team's spirit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On a frenetic first day's action at Bercy Arena, a boisterous crowd was treated to a taste of the thrills and spills ahead, with American superstar Simone Biles making her eagerly awaited entrance on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russian Olympic Committee won the men's team title at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but Russian gymnasts are not defending their title, leaving China as favourites to take gold for the first time since London 2012 on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Led by Olympic debutant Zhang, China topped the team qualifying standings by 2.434 points from Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain, featuring world vault champion Jake Jarman and double Olympic pommel horse gold medallist Max Whitlock, were third ahead of Ukraine and the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang topped the individual all-around table from Japan's Shinnosuke Oka and defending champion Daiki Hashimoto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm happy with that, it's my highest score in a major competition this year" said Zhang.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our team performed excellently. Everyone did very well and showed great team spirit." (AFP)

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday called on the United States to return to a rational and pragmatic policy towards China as he urged Washington not to continue to stir up trouble in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang also urged the United States to "refrain from fanning the flames" in the territorial dispute between Beijing and the Philippines, the foreign ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The US side should refrain from fanning the flames, stirring up trouble and undermining stability at sea," Wang said, according to a ministry statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It comes as Wang met with his US counterpart Antony Blinken on the sidelines of a foreign ministers meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US hailed the talks between Blinken and Wang as "open and productive" with the two sides discussing issues of mutual concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's talks lasted for one hour and twenty minutes, according to a senior US State Department official. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's shooters on Saturday claimed the first gold at the Paris Olympics, with a victory in the 10-metre air rifle mixed team event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Seventeen-year-old Huang Yuting and 19-year-old Sheng Lihao clinched their victory over South Koreans Keum Jihyeon and Park Hajun, outscoring their opponents 16-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had earlier topped the qualifying round with a score of 632.2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had fielded two pairs to compete in the mixed team event, including Han Jiayu and Du Linshu, who placed eighth in the qualifying round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kazakhstan, meanwhile, won the first bronze medal in the same event after beating Germany.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, divers Chang Yani and Chen Yiwen won the women's synchronised three-metre springboard event, kicking off China's bid to take home all eight diving gold medals at the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Olympians Chang and Chen outshone their opponents in each of the five rounds, finishing with an overall score of 337.68.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair had previously won in the same event in the past three World Championships.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Saturday said that top diplomat Wang Yi had said China will "respond resolutely" to any violation by the Philippines of a recent deal to calm tensions between the two countries in the South China Sea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang on Friday called on the Philippines to "honour its commitments" under the deal rather than "backtracking or creating complications", according to a readout of his meeting with Philippine foreign secretary Enrique Manalo at an Asean gathering in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, China will definitely respond resolutely," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang said China has recently reached a temporary arrangement with the Philippines on the transportation and replenishment of humanitarian supplies to Ren'ai Jiao in order to maintain the stability of the maritime situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters late on Friday, Manalo said he hoped Beijing would keep its side of the bargain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that would be an important step forward in diffusing tensions and hopefully lead to other areas of cooperation on the South China Sea," Manalo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also warned the Philippines over the deployment of US intermediate-range missiles, saying such a move could fuel regional tensions and spark an arms race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The US deployed its Typhon missile system to the Philippines as part of joint military drills earlier this year. It was not fired during the exercises, a Philippine military official later said, without giving details on how long it would stay in the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang and Manalo met in Laos capital Vientiane, host of an Asean foreign ministers meeting.
  <br/>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Typhoon Gaemi made landfall in Fujian province on Thursday night after it swept through Taiwan where it killed three people, triggered floods and sank a freighter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Gaemi is the biggest typhoon to hit China's eastern seaboard this year, with its spiralling cloud-bands spanning most of the Western Pacific Ocean and fuelling severe weather from the Philippines to Japan's Okinawa islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The nation's Transport Ministry had earlier upgraded the typhoon prevention response to level two, the second highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  State media said some rail services in Guangzhou were suspended, while Wenzhou in Zhejiang province stopped multiple passenger sailings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said it will closely monitor the typhoon, strengthen warning and coordination with other departments, and guide local transport authorities on typhoon prevention and response.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fujian authorities had relocated 156,800 residents as of 7am on Thursday. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will visit China for five days from Saturday, Beijing said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "At the invitation of Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will pay an official visit to China from July 27 to 31," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will be Meloni's first to China since she took office in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will meet with President Xi Jinping as well as Premier Li during the trip, Mao told a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will "hold talks with her... to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing would "deepen practical cooperation and cultural exchange," Mao added, as well as "promote the steady and long-term development of China-Italy and China-Europe relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meloni's administration withdrew from the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative last year, but has since sought to mend ties with China, a key trading partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani visited Beijing last year, meeting his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi who said cooperation with Italy had been "fruitful".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In April, Tajani said Rome intended to strengthen trade despite its withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative. "Our relations with China are positive, even if we are competitors and our positions diverge on certain issues," he told reporters. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday cut a medium-term interest rate, marking the latest move by the authorities to boost economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The country's central bank cut the rate for its medium-term lending facility (MLF) – the interest for one-year loans to financial institutions – to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC issued 200 billion yuan in one-year loans under its MLF at 2.3 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The last time the rate was cut was in August but the latest is the biggest since April 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Marco Sun, chief financial market analyst at MUFG Bank (China), said Thursday's move could reduce the cost of financing and release cash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The unexpected MLF operation was also due to a large amount of MLF loans coming due, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the PBOC cut two benchmark lending rates, days after the Communist Party's third plenary session which outlined major reforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, major commercial banks announced reductions in deposit rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and China Construction Bank was cut by 10 basis points to 1.35 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first deposit rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's legendary table tennis player Ma Long and artistic swimmer Feng Yu will carry China's flag at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games opening ceremony on Friday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma, who has claimed three team golds and two singles titles in previous Olympic Games, will be making his fourth Olympic appearance in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Having led China's artistic swimming team to a silver medal at Tokyo 2020, the 24-year-old Feng looks to dream bigger in Paris. China has made steady progress in artistic swimming in recent years, sealing golds in all five Olympic routines at the World Championships in Doha.
  <br/>

  "The two candidates reflect our recognition of veteran athletes who persist in their careers, as well as the encouragement to the rising events and youngsters," said Zhang Xin, the secretary-general of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, China has announced a delegation of 716 members, including 405 athletes, for the Paris Olympic Games. 136 male and 269 female athletes will compete in 236 events across 30 sports at the July 26 to August 11 Games. (Xinhua)

 China's ambassador to France said the Paris Olympics will further boost sports and cultural cooperation between the two countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK in Paris, Lu Shaye said China and France can leverage the Games and work together in sharing sports resources and training young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On one hand, China and France can strengthen cooperation on sharing resources on sports where each country excels, like table tennis and diving for China and football and fencing for France,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, we can also promote sports education cooperation, encouraging Chinese and French primary and secondary school students to go to each other's country to join summer and winter sports camps.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lu also said themed exhibitions will be held at the China House in Paris during the Olympic Games to showcase Chinese cultural traditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year marks the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France. Lu said talks between President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in May brought relations to new heights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two sides issued a total of four joint statements, on the situation in the Middle East, artificial intelligence, global governance and biodiversity... Nearly 20 bilateral cooperation documents were signed. The China-France comprehensive strategic partnership has been further consolidated and deepened,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The envoy added that Hong Kong plays an important role in promoting people-to-people exchanges between China and France.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday hosted his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Guangzhou, with both sides calling for peace amid the war between Ukraine and Russia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kuleba said he is seeking common ground in talks with Wang on ending the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign minister said Kyiv "also wants to follow the path of peace, recovery, and development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang called for the healthy and steady development of ties between China and Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the two countries established their strategic partnership more than a decade ago, and have treated each other with mutual respect and equality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said the pair exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the conditions and timing are not yet mature, we support all efforts that contribute to peace and are willing to continue to play a constructive role for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks," Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China has always been firmly committed to promoting a political solution to the crisis," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba's four-day visit to China, which began on Tuesday, is the first by a Ukrainian foreign minister since the war started in 2022. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Russia on Tuesday pushed back against a US warning over their military and economic cooperation in the Arctic, where climate change is opening up greater competition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said it acts on the "principles of respect, cooperation, mutual wins and sustainability", adding it's committed to maintaining peace and stability in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The United States distorts China's Arctic policy and makes thoughtless remarks on China's normal Arctic activities (which are) in accordance with international law," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia "does its part to ensure that the Arctic does not become a territory of discord and tension."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told reporters that Russia's cooperation with China "contributes to an atmosphere of stability and predictability" in the Arctic, and their actions were not targeted against other countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Monday, US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks said, "We've seen growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia in the Arctic commercially, with the PRC being a major funder of Russian energy exploitation in the Arctic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There is also growing military cooperation, "with Russia and China conducting joint exercises off the coast of Alaska," Hicks said as the department released its 2024 Arctic strategy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Washington's Arctic strategy describes the area as "a strategically important region" for the US that includes "the northern approaches to the homeland" and "significant US defence infrastructure." (Reporting by AFP)

    Hamas, Fatah sign landmark declaration in Beijing

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Foreign Minister Wang Yi, centre, and members of various Palestinian factions attend the signing of the Beijing Declaration aimed at ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762795_1_20240723145747.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hamas on Tuesday announced it had signed an agreement in Beijing with other Palestinian organisations including rivals Fatah to work together for "national unity", with China describing it as a deal to rule Gaza together once the war ends.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who hosted senior Hamas official Musa Abu Marzuk, Fatah envoy Mahmud al-Aloul and emissaries from 12 other Palestinian groups, said they had agreed to set up an "interim national reconciliation government" to govern post-war Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today we sign an agreement for national unity and we say that the path to completing this journey is national unity. We are committed to national unity and we call for it," Abu Marzuk said after meeting Wang and the other envoys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Palestinian factions met with the media, with Wang present, CGTN said in a social media post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The declaration was signed at the closing ceremony of a reconciliation dialogue among the factions held in Beijing from July 21-23, CCTV said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes more than nine months into a war sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel last October, which resulted in the deaths of 1,197 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom are still in Gaza, including 44 the Israeli military says are dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,000 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The relentless fighting has plunged Gaza into a severe humanitarian crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has sought to play a mediator role in the conflict, which has been rendered even more complex due to the intense rivalry between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and Fatah, which partially governs the occupied West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it destroys Hamas, and world powers including key Israeli backer the United States have scrambled to imagine scenarios for the governance of Gaza once the war ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As Tuesday's meeting wrapped up in Beijing, Wang said the groups had committed to "reconciliation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most prominent highlight is the agreement to form an interim national reconciliation government around the governance of post-war Gaza," he said following the signing of the Beijing Declaration by the factions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Reconciliation is an internal matter for the Palestinian factions, but at the same time, it cannot be achieved without the support of the international community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China sincerely hopes that the Palestinian factions will achieve Palestinian independence at an early date on the basis of internal reconciliation, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties to jointly work to implement the Beijing Declaration reached today."

    More rate cuts by PBOC to come: economists

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Economists are anticipating more interest rate cuts by the mainland’s central bank this year, after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced the reduction of two benchmark rates on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The PBOC lowered the one-year loan prime rate from 3.45 percent to 3.35 percent, and the five-year rate from 3.95 percent to 3.85 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Greater China Economist at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Michelle Lam said the rate cuts came earlier than expected, but she predicts the trims to have a limited impact on the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't think that a 10 basis point cut will be a game changer. And also right now, there's a lot of weak confidence among households. So probably it will not be very impactful in terms of boosting household consumption," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But still, it's better than not doing anything. So there will still be maybe somewhat marginally positive [impact] to support the domestic demand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate cuts came after the mainland saw slower-than-forecast economic growth of 4.7 percent in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hunter Chan, a Greater China Economist at Standard Chartered, said he believes the rate reductions will provide some support to the mainland's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cutting is to strengthen the countercyclical adjustment and to support the real economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we suggest the economy needs more supporting measures. And I guess the central bank also acted on that, to provide enough support to the real economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said he expects there will be at least one 10 basis point rate cut in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PBOC on Monday also lowered the interest rates on its standing lending facility, a type of loans that it lends to commercial banks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The overnight, seven-day and one-month rates were cut by 10 basis points to 2.55 percent, 2.7 percent and 3.05 percent respectively.

 China cut benchmark lending rates at a monthly fixing on Monday, after the central bank surprised the markets by lowering a key short-term policy rate earlier in the session.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.35 percent from 3.45 percent previously, while the five-year LPR was reduced by the same margin to 3.85 percent from 3.95 percent .

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media on Sunday said rescuers had found the bodies of ten people swept away by flash floods in Sichuan province, as extreme weather continues in many parts of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency said 29 people remained missing after heavy rain triggered the flooding at a village under the city of Ya’an.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rescuers were reported to be using drones, sniffer dogs and life detectors to search for the missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visiting the scene, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing called for all-out efforts to rescue the missing. He also said efforts should be increased to prevent secondary disasters, such as mudslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said local authorities across the country should further strengthen preparations for heavy rain and flooding, especially in vulnerable areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Xinhua reported that 15 bodies had now been found after Friday’s collapse of a highway bridge in Shaanxi province. That disaster was also triggered by heavy rain.

 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said young people from Hong Kong can play a key role in the nation's technological development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong said people in Hong Kong now had a better understanding of the country, as patriotic education had been integrated into their daily lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hoped the territory's young people can use their knowledge of technology to offer more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a relatively strong foundation in technology, and has many high-quality tech talents who love the country and Hong Kong," he said at an awards ceremony honouring the work of teenagers in aerospace innovation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an important driving factor in the country's development into an innovative nation... I hope Hong Kong teenagers can reach the peak of technology through their hard work and ambition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the country had high hopes that Hong Kong would develop into an international innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authorities will continue their efforts to nurture the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology is the primary productive force; talent is the primary opportunity; and innovation is the primary driving force," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government attaches great importance to the development of innovation and technology, making every effort to cultivate local talent and increase investment in the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that a Hong Kong resident had been selected for the national manned space programme, and he hopes more young people can aim to join developments in the national aerospace industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 State media reports say 12 people have been confirmed dead after a highway bridge partially collapsed amid downpours on Friday night in northwestern Shaanxi province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The official Xinhua news agency says sudden heavy rain and flash floods caused the collapse in the city of Shangluo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said five vehicles that had plunged into the river below had been recovered as of Saturday morning. Rescue operations were continuing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua said at least 31 people remained missing. It reported that 17 cars and eight trucks had fallen into the river.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier on Friday, officials in another city in Shaanxi, Baoji, said five people had been confirmed dead and eight others were missing following torrential rain earlier in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the city had suffered record daily rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday he would meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi next week at an Asean ministerial meeting in Laos.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I speak to him on a fairly regular basis, and I'll be seeing him next week, in fact, in Laos," Blinken said during a security forum in the US state of Colorado, welcoming the dialogue with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not specify whether the two would hold a separate bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) foreign ministers meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite disagreements in several key areas, relations between the United States and China have stabilised since a summit between US President Joe Biden and his President Xi Jinping in November 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have reestablished regular, high-level engagements between our countries, which is vitally important, because if you want to avoid any kind of unintended conflict, you have to start talking, you have to start communicating," said Blinken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his second visit to China in less than a year, Blinken met in April with Xi, who called on the two countries to be "partners, not rivals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Friday, the top US diplomat spoke of a "steady pace" of meetings, including between the two countries' militaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important because we're able to communicate very clearly where we disagree. So China at least knows where we're coming from, just like we know where they're coming from," he said. (AFP)

    'Higher people's confidence to boost domestic demand'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Einar Tanger says consumers should have confidence in the Chinese economy. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762259_2_20240719133037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Beijing-based commentator said China is trying to boost people's confidence to help shore up domestic demand and overall economic growth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The end of the Communist Party's third plenum on Thursday saw the adoption of a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively, with the goal of building a high-standard socialist market economy by 2035.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Latest government figures showed growth in the world's second-largest economy slowed to 4.7 percent in the second quarter, down from 5.3 percent in the January-March period. Retail sales also reported slower growth, from 3.7 percent in May to 2 percent in June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of domestic demand, they're trying to instil confidence. They want people to believe in what the party is doing, the fact that China is 30 percent of the world's growth, that it continues to be the centre of manufacturing," Einar Tanger, a senior fellow at the Taihe Institute and chairman of Asia Narratives, told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese consumers should realise that, that China is in a better position to weather the current storms and uncertainties that are being caused internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tanger said another key challenge for the authorities is to stabilise the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The real estate sector is a product of very large companies taking huge leverage. They were borrowing massive amounts of money on the expectation that they'd make lots of profits. Unfortunately, the demand did not justify supply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government does not want to see a spiral of inflationary rises in housing prices because they're already too high. So what they're trying to do is to keep them steady. So you can expect them to continue to say, 'Look, if you've bought a house, we'll make sure that it gets finished,' but they're not going to put money into the pockets of these very wealthy developers who have not been very good businessmen."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Beijing on Friday said it will boost local governments' fiscal capacity and expand their tax sources, a day after it laid out a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press conference to explain the guiding principles from the third plenary session which concluded on Thursday, Han Wenxiu, deputy director in charge of the party's financial and economic affairs said the central government will be increasing its fiscal spending obligations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that President Xi Jinping had pointed out that economic structural reform and livelihood improvement are at the forefront of accelerating reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To address the fiscal difficulties faced by the local governments and grassroots-level governments, we need to improve the fiscal relations between the central and local governments, increase the fiscal resources and expand tax bases of local governments," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Han said authorities would also study ways to tweak the taxation system so that it is better positioned to develop new forms of businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked how the nation would handle the slowdown in the real estate sector while supporting new economic growth drivers, Han explained that there are major changes in the property market's supply and demand and that it is undergoing a period of adjustment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the nation needs to uphold the principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to promote stable and healthy development in the real estate market. Recently there have been some positive changes in the real estate market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to make progress in both absorbing the existing stock and improving new supplies, further implement and improve the new policies for real estate development, ensure the delivery of housing projects and activate the stock of residential properties and land resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Han also said China should speed up the issuance and use of special treasury bonds, and that monetary policy should be flexible, moderate, accurate and effective. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 High-quality development is China's priority in building a modern socialist country, and the nation must consciously place reform in a more prominent position, according to a communique issued on Thursday after a top-level meeting in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China’s Communist Party wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique stated the need to deepen supply-side structural reform, improve incentive and constraint mechanisms for promoting high-quality development, and create new growth drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will improve the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy, for developing the service sector, for modernising infrastructure, and for enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains," the communique stated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to evaluate the implementation of the '14th Five-Year Plan' and work on the preliminary planning work of the '15th Five-Year Plan'."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be measures to prevent and defuse risks in key areas such as real estate, local government debt, and small and medium-sized financial institutions, according to the communique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, while encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public economy, it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum document also listed the overall objectives of further deepening reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernised our system and capacity for governance, and basically realised socialist modernisation," the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will pave the way for building China into a great modern socialist country by the middle of the century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The communique added the reform tasks laid out in the resolution should be completed in 2029 when the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will resolutely safeguard national security and social stability, vigorously promote national defence and its military, continue to promote works focusing on Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and push for diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, the communique said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the country's opening up, the document said the party will steadily expand institutional opening up, deepen the structural reform on foreign trade, further reform the management systems of investment, improve regional opening up, and refine the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, the communique said the session decided to accept former foreign minister Qin Gang's resignation from the Central Committee, and confirmed the Politburo’s earlier decision to expel former defence minister Li Shangfu as well as Li Yuchao and Sun Jinming of the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force, from the party.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A preliminary investigation into Wednesday's fire at a shopping centre in Sichuan province that killed 16 people indicated that it was caused by construction work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The blaze started at around 6pm in the mall at the foot of a 14-storey building in the city of Zigong. It was put out more than two hours later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A rescue operation lasted for hours into Thursday. Reports said dozens who had been trapped were plucked to safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Footage on social media showed thick black smoke rising from the building.

  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management and National Fire and Rescue Administration said they have dispatched a working team to Sichuan following the deadly fire.

    China voices support for Palestinian factions meeting

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Displaced Palestinian children play on swings, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Deir Al-Balah, in central Gaza Strip. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=60&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761873_2_20240717061007.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed willingness to facilitate "reconciliation" between rival Palestinian factions, after Fatah said its officials would meet in Beijing with Hamas counterparts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hamas later said it would be attending talks in the Chinese capital at what it called an "expanded factional meeting" this weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The movement responded with a positive spirit and national responsibility," official Hossam Badran said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hamas was "keen on achieving national unity worthy of our Palestinian people... especially in light of the Al-Aqsa Flood battle," he added, using the militant group's name for its October 7 attack on Israel that set off the Gaza war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing had "always supported all sides in Palestine to achieve reconciliation and unity through dialogue and negotiation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China, he said, was "willing to develop dialogue and reconciliation, provide a platform and create opportunities for all sides on the Palestine issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is willing to strengthen communication with all parties and work hard to realise the aim of Palestine's domestic reconciliation," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two Palestinian groups have been bitter rivals since Hamas fighters ejected Fatah from the Gaza Strip after deadly clashes that followed Hamas' resounding victory in a 2006 election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several reconciliation bids have failed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But calls have grown since the Hamas October attack and nine-month war in Gaza, with violence also soaring in the West Bank, where Fatah is based.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hosted Fatah and Hamas in April but a meeting scheduled for June was postponed.

 Henan province on Tuesday issued an orange alert for rainstorm, the second-highest level in the country's four-tier weather warning system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From Monday to Tuesday morning, heavy downpours lashed many parts of the province, with a maximum precipitation of 638.5mm recorded in Sheqi County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The province's meteorological observatory has forecast heavy rain to fall in some areas till 9am on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's northern regions are bracing for extreme weather conditions. According to a meeting held on Monday by authorities including the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, the main rain belt is expected to move northwards in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That will bring heavy rainfall to the Sichuan Basin and the Huanghuai region, encompassing parts of several provinces, including Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ministry of Emergency Management has ordered relevant provincial-level regions to focus on vulnerable areas, including flood-prone rivers and urban drainage systems. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 A 34-year-old man, allegedly linked to the suspected murder of a Chinese woman in Thailand, was arrested in Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yan Ruimin, a 38-year-old influencer, went missing during her solo trip to Thailand and is suspected to have been dismembered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect allegedly fled to Macau after the woman's death and tried to pawn a fake watch at a shop last Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the shop staff were suspicious and reported him to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers eventually caught him at the Taipa Ferry Terminal and handed him over to mainland police on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the investigation, Macau police were informed by mainland authorities that the suspect could be hiding in Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After checking his identity, it was confirmed that he was the suspect in the murder case.

    China's economy slows in second quarter

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China's economy grew 4.7 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2024, less than analysts had expected. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1761623_1_20240715111349.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's economy expanded at a slower-than-forecast 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, the government reported on Monday, while emphasising signs of improvement in factory output, income and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Second-quarter growth was below the 5.3 percent seen in the first quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economists said weak consumer demand and reduced government spending were dragging on growth in the world's No. 2 economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first six months of 2024, the economy expanded by five percent, in line with the country's growth forecast for the entire year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's retail sales slowed to two percent growth in June, official data showed, suggesting continued struggles to boost consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In June, the total retail sales of consumer goods went up by 2.0 percent year on year," the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said. May's figure was 3.7 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sales were up 3.7 percent year on year in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial output, meanwhile, climbed 5.3 percent year on year last month, and rose 6 percent for the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The urban unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 5.3 percent from the same period a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS attributed the weaker second-quarter GDP growth to short-term factors such as extreme weather and floods, but said it also reflected rising challenges, especially from insufficient effective demand and unsmooth economic flow at home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, the national economy has continued to improve in the first half in a stable manner," the NBS said in a statement, citing support from policy incentives, rebound in external demand and development of new quality productive forces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Yeung, a chief Greater China economist at ANZ Bank, told RTHK that weak retail sales dragged down GDP growth in the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's also very consistent with our on-the-ground observations in different cities in China. Of course you don't notice that when Hong Kong people go to Shenzhen. But in other cities, which is clearly more domestic, the consumption level is clearly weak."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The release of the latest economic figures came as leaders of the Communist Party gathered for a once-a-decade conclave to set economic policy that was expected to focus on self-sufficient strategies for growth in an era of tensions over trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four-day meeting of the Communist Party’s 205-member Central Committee is the third plenary session of a five-year term that started in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, President and party general secretary Xi Jinping delivered a work report on behalf of the Politburo at the start of the third plenum and expounded on a draft decision on further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such meetings typically focus on long-term issues, but business owners and investors are watching to see if the party announces any immediate measures to try to counter a prolonged downturn in the property market and boost the country's post-pandemic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the third plenary session has to focus on stabilising employment, noting reports of layoffs and salary cuts in the private sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ultimately, what we need is to have a stable labour market and stable employment so that households will be more confident in spending. And that wage dynamic is the most important area the policymakers really need to focus on in the future," he said. (RTHK/Agencies)

    Turkey puts its best foot forward to Chinese investors

<div class="itemFullText">
 Turkey plans to draw on its geographical position and an EU customs deal to entice Chinese investors keen to access European markets tariff-free, as it recently just did with carmaker BYD.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chinese electric vehicle giant signed a billion-dollar deal with Ankara on Monday to open a plant in western Turkey, promising to create 5,000 jobs, a move that will help it avoid new EU tariffs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The country, at the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, is in talks with other Chinese companies, Turkey's Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kacir said this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to transform Turkey into a production centre for the next generation of vehicles," Kacir told private broadcaster Haberturk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister emphasised his country's selling points, including being part of the EU's customs union and having trade agreements with 28 countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Chinese producers want rapid access to international markets," he said. "Investing in Turkey offers them that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ankara struck a customs deal with the EU in 1995 that enables the free flow between them of a number of goods, notably cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey became one of the leading centres of the world's automobile industry starting in the 1970s, when major carmakers including Fiat and Renault opened plants there -- with others like Ford, Toyota and Hyundai following.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under new regulations on investment incentives, BYD will be able to circumvent a new 40 percent tariff that Turkey originally imposed on electric vehicle import - Manufacturers investing in the country will be exempt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish manufacturer TOGG and Chinese firm Farasis have also partnered up to produce EV batteries in Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkish officials have held numerous meetings with Chinese industrialists in the last year, according to the industry ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turkey's foreign affairs minister Hakan Fidan visited China in June to seal a new bilateral deal, calling the countries "drivers of Asian wealth." (AFP)

 China said on Friday it was conducting joint military drills with Russia along its southern coast.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Defence Ministry said the two militaries had begun the exercises, called Joint Sea-2024, in early July, and they would last until the middle of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drills in the waters and airspace around Zhanjiang, in Guangdong province, are "to demonstrate the resolve and capabilities of the two sides in jointly addressing maritime security threats and preserving global and regional peace and stability", the ministry said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the exercises "will further deepen China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era".
  <br/>

  Chinese forces are also staging drills this week with Belarus near Poland.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s exports rose at their fastest in 15 months in June, customs data showed Friday, while imports declined.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-biggest economy grew 8.6 percent year-on-year in value last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That marked a third consecutive rise after a year-on-year decline in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports rose 6.9 percent in the first six months of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports, however, hit a four-month low in June, shrinking 2.3 percent compared with a 1.8 percent rise the month before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This reflects the economic condition in China, with weak domestic demand and strong production capacity relying on exports," Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China’s trade surplus last month reached US$99 billion, up from US$82.6 billion in May. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has criticised a move by Germany to remove Chinese telecom components from its 5G networks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany on Thursday said it will phase out the use of components made by Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks, citing national security concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said critical components from Huawei and ZTE will be barred from 5G core networks by the end of 2026, while “critical management systems” from the two manufacturers in 5G access and transport networks must be replaced by the end of 2029.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Chinese embassy in Berlin said Germany's decision was based on "groundless accusations", adding that Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE have long operated in the country in compliance with laws and regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement also said the move by Berlin would severely damage mutual trust and affect future cooperation between China and the European Union in relevant fields.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huawei said there was no specific evidence that the firm's "technology has cyber security risks".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Huawei has developed into a continuously innovative, secure, and reliable telecom equipment supplier in the German market," a spokesperson said. (Agencies)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China does not accept the groundless accusations made at the recent Nato summit in Washington against Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a phone call with his Dutch counterpart Caspar Veldkamp, Wang said Nato should stay within its bounds and refrain from interfering in China's or Asia-Pacific affairs, and from challenging Beijing's legitimate rights and interests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foreign minister said China and Nato countries have different political systems and values, but this should not be a reason for the alliance to "instigate confrontation with China".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that Beijing is willing to maintain contact with Nato on "an equal footing" and conduct exchanges on the basis of mutual respect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nato has accused China of playing a key role in helping Russia's assault on Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On ties between China and the Netherlands, Wang said Beijing is willing to strengthen cooperation with Amsterdam to jointly safeguard the stability of global industrial and supply chains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veldkamp said the Dutch side does not support "decoupling" from China and is willing to maintain communication with Beijing. (Xinhua, with additional reporting by Reuters)

    China warns Nato against 'provoking confrontation'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday warned Nato against "provoking confrontation" over its ties with Russia, after the alliance accused it of playing a key role in helping Moscow's assault on Ukraine.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Beijing said a declaration from Nato leaders from their Washington summit was full of "belligerent rhetoric" and the China-related content has provocations and lies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Nato statement claimed that China had "become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine", and that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also claimed Beijing's "so-called 'no limits' partnership" and "large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base" were of "profound concern".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said: "Nato should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is known to all that China is not the creator [of] the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears," the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war, but did not get into specifics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also repeatedly hit out at Nato criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Top officials of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, in attendance at Nato, have forged stronger ties with the security alliance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said: "We firmly oppose Nato acting beyond its characterisation as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Wednesday said it would launch a formal probe looking into EU practices during an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese firms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce will conduct a trade and investment barrier investigation into the relevant practices adopted by the EU in its investigation of Chinese enterprises," the ministry said in a note on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ministry officials said they had decided to launch the probe following a complaint made by the national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The complaint mainly dealt with "products such as railway locomotives, photovoltaics, wind power and security inspection equipment", according to the ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation will last from July 10 to January 10, 2025, and could be extended to April 10, 2025 under special conditions, the ministry said. (Agencies)

 Mainland customs officers have caught a man at a border crossing point between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with over 100 live snakes stuffed in his trousers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news of the reptilian round-up was announced by China Customs on its official WeChat account on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers at the Futian boundary control point recently stopped the man, who was passing through the checkpoint without making any declarations, for an inspection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They found 104 live snakes in six sealed drawstring bags that were in the man's pockets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were five types of reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, with most of them being introduced species.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Consumer price inflation on the mainland slowed in June, while producer price deflation persisted, as Beijing's support measures set a bumpy economic recovery in motion for the world's second-largest economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index (CPI) in June rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier, against a 0.3 percent rise in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CPI edged down 0.2 percent month-on-month, versus a 0.1 percent drop in May and worsening from an expected 0.1 percent fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The producer price index (PPI) fell 0.8 percent in June from a year earlier, narrowing from a 1.4 percent decline the previous month, and matching a forecast 0.8 percent fall. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China has allocated an additional 848 million yuan to support local flood rescue efforts, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The fund, allocated by the MOF and the Ministry of Water Resources, will mainly be used to assist rescue work by local authorities in the flood-hit regions, including Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Guangdong provinces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, rescue personnel successfully sealed a 226m breach in a dyke at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, on Monday, according to local authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.31pm, the final truckload of rocks was dumped into the breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sealing will expedite drainage and post-disaster reconstruction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The breach at Dongting Lake in the city of Yueyang in Hunan was caused by floodwaters from torrential rain, with more than 7,000 residents evacuated since the dyke burst on Friday afternoon. (Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 An embankment seen as the second line of defence following a dyke breach in Hunan province was under threat on Monday, local authorities said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 300 police officers and firefighters were working at the site to stem the piping effect that is eroding the embankment in Huarong County, said the province's water resources department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14.3km embankment is located around 2km behind the dyke that burst on Friday at Dongting Lake, China's second-largest freshwater lake, following a heavy rainstorm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The piping effect can hollow out a dyke and lead to a burst if not properly handled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At least 7,000 residents have been evacuated following the dyke burst on Friday, and workers have been racing against time to seal the 226m breach. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday called on the international community to help Ukraine and Russia resume dialogue in a bid to resolve their conflict.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi and visiting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis in talks in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban briefed Xi on his recent visits to Ukraine and Russia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president stressed an early ceasefire and a political settlement are in the interests of all parties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi called on the international community "to create conditions and provide support for the resumption of direct dialogue and negotiation between the two sides."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua quoted him as saying that "only if all major countries inject positive rather than negative energy, can a ceasefire in this conflict emerge as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides Russia and Ukraine, the end of the war “depends on the decision of three world powers, the United States, the European Union and China,” Orban wrote in a Facebook post showing him shaking hands with Xi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Peace mission 3.0” is how Orban captioned a picture posted on the X social media platform depicting him after having stepped off his plane in Beijing earlier on Monday in this previously unannounced visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary assumed the rotating presidency of the EU at the start of July, and Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Orban had come to Moscow as a top representative of the European Council. Several top European officials dismissed that suggestion and said Orban had no mandate for anything beyond a discussion about bilateral relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi visited Hungary in May this year for the final leg of a European tour that also took him to France and Serbia. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday he had arrived in Beijing on "Peace mission 3.0" after recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Orban was greeted at the airport by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, according to a photo he posted on social media platform X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His arrival in Beijing follows surprise visits to Russia and Ukraine in the past week since Hungary took over the European Union's rotating presidency at the start of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Orban, the friendliest EU leader towards Moscow, held talks with President Vladimir Putin on Friday about the war in Ukraine during a trip criticised by both Kyiv and the EU, which said it threatened to undermine the bloc's stance on the conflict.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His visit also came days before a Nato summit that will address further military aid for Ukraine against what the Western defence alliance has called Russia's "unprovoked war of aggression".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a short statement, the Foreign Ministry said the Hungarian leader would meet President Xi Jinping on Monday "for in-depth communication on issues of mutual interest".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hungary, under Orban, has become an important trade and investment partner for China, in contrast with some other EU nations. (AFP/Reuters)

 Premier Li Qiang on Sunday congratulated Keir Starmer on becoming UK prime minister, following the general election on Thursday which swept Starmer's Labour Party to power with a huge majority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China and Britain are both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and major economies, adding that greater cooperation between the two nations not only serves the interests of the two, but also helps the international community address global challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the Chinese government attaches great importance to its relationship with Britain, and stands ready to work with the new British government to consolidate mutual political trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, support the economic and social development of both countries, and jointly promote world peace, stability, and prosperity.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry announced on Friday that it will hold an anti-dumping hearing on brandy imported from the European Union on July 18.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will be about "industrial damage, cause and effect, and public interest in the anti-dumping probe of related brandy products", Xinhua News Agency quoted an online statement by the ministry as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing aims to ensure that the investigation procedure is fair, just and transparent, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's anti-dumping probe into EU brandy products would look at EU-produced brandy in containers holding less than 200 litres imported from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the ministry has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also investigate any damage done to the Chinese brandy industry from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is expected to end before January 5, 2025, but may be extended for half a year under special circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement by the Commerce Ministry comes as the European Commission's provisional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its EV tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. It has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, but that it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also opened investigations into European pork imports. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday called on the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to ensure security in the face of real threat from the Cold War mentality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when attending the SCO summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the member states to adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address complex and intertwined security challenges through dialogue and coordination, and respond to the profoundly changing international landscape with a win-win approach, so as to build a world of lasting peace and universal security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the world is faced with accelerating changes unseen in a century, the human society is standing at a crossroads of history again, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president pointed out that the SCO stands on the right side of history, fairness and justice, and is of great significance to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SCO members should consolidate unity and jointly oppose external interference in the face of the real challenges of interference and division, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasised the group's focus on ensuring security of its members, and said the SCO will form a dedicated centre that will coordinate response to various security challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group's members will also endorse a special program to fight separatism and extremism. (Xinhua/AP)
