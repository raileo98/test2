<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese lunar probe has returned to Earth with the first ever samples collected from the moon's far side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 touched down in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region shortly after 2pm on Tuesday, completing its complex and challenging 53-day lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The returner of [the] Chang'e-6 mission has landed successfully at Siziwang Banner, at the designated area. I would like to announce that the Chang'e-6 lunar mission has achieved a complete success," said Zhang Kejian, the director of the China National Space Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also extended his congratulations on the complete success of the lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a congratulatory message carried by state media, Xi said the "outstanding contributions" of the mission command "will be remembered forever by the motherland and the people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The re-entry capsule brought back lunar soil and rocks that it spent two days collecting by a drill and robotic arm from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth. It would be brought to Beijing for further studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre in Hainan on May 3, and descended into the moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday said the Chinese economy had gotten off to a "good start" this year, and that the nation will continue to strive to create an open environment for technological innovations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li made the remarks at a keynote speech at the opening of a World Economic Forum meeting – also known as Summer Davos – in Dalian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said: "The rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the start of this year the Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. It got off to a good start in the first quarter of this year... and continued steady growth in the second quarter. We're confident and capable in achieving the growth target of around five percent for this year," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also proposed that there should be a deepening of exchanges and cooperation in science and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Science and technology are key variables in future development and major sci-tech progress usually comes from unrelenting research accumulation and extensive cooperation," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier also told delegates that the nation's electric vehicles and lithium batteries were not only meeting domestic demand, but also enriching global supply amid trade tensions with the West.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 1,600 leading figures from the public and private sectors across nearly 80 countries and regions are attending the 15th Annual Meeting of the New Champions event which is being held until June 27. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the meeting Duda told Xi that relations between Poland and China remained strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russia-Ukraine conflict was on the agenda for talks, but no remarks on the issue were delivered before journalists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after the Commerce Ministry said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to consider both parties' reasonable concerns to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner, Wang said during a meeting with Habeck who is on a visit to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister added that China hopes that Germany will play a positive role in the EU, prompting the European side to meet China halfway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks," Habeck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. "We are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Habeck had said earlier on Saturday that the European Union's door was open for discussions regarding EU tariffs on Chinese exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission has announced provisional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese EVs by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has spoken out against the move, describing the higher duties as protectionist. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Long March 2-C rocket carrying a satellite jointly developed by China and France dubbed the Space Variable Objects Monitor, lifts off from a space base in Xichang, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758613_1_20240622222543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said Friday that the European Union was to blame for escalating trade frictions with China, which could lead to a "trade war".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Responsibility lies entirely with the EU side," a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hoped the EU would meet it halfway, handle differences through dialogue and avoid escalating trade friction or allowing it to get out of control, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the European Commission proposed tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicle imports from China despite Beijing's protest, plunging trade ties to a new low and risking punitive action from the world's second-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry statement was published just before the arrival of German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Beijing, where he was expected to explain to Chinese officials the recent tariff announcement while allaying the risk of retaliation that could harm German businesses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Days of torrential rain, flash floods and landslides across southern China have forced authorities to enact emergency plans, as swollen rivers threaten to overflow further, potentially disrupting the lives of millions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Guangdong upgraded an emergency response plan for disasters like landslides and flooding to the second-highest level, helping to coordinate and deploy resources across the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other provinces have already activated a Level-IV emergency response for flood control as this year's flooding season kicked into high gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.

  <br/>
  Heavy rain and landslides in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have already killed at least nine people and left several people missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi in southwest China, raised a "red" flood warning signal, the highest level, late on Wednesday when the water level of the Li River, which runs through the city, reached 3.61 metres above the warning line, China Daily reported on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water level at the river's hydrological station in Rongjiang township hit a record high, threatening residents' lives and properties along the river, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guilin authorities urged departments, townships and scenic spots to help prevent and combat possible flooding in the coming days as water levels at major rivers continue to rise, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate to heavy rain is expected to start again from Friday through Monday in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in Asia, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced it had opened a new regional centre in Shanghai to further strengthen its engagement and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday, renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with Malaysia," Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism and communications, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang, left, visits Western Australia's only operating lithium hydroxide plant Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links topped the agenda of Premier Li Qiang's visit to the Australian city of Perth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China's economy has continued to rebound and improve, with its new growth drivers gaining momentum, against the backdrop of sluggish global growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the final leg of his trip to Australia, the premier said China was planning major measures for further comprehensively deepening reform and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, and the country's business environment will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip to Perth, Li inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Perth from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders on Monday held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two trading partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people have been killed in southern China from heavy rains that triggered landslides, knocked out power for entire villages and buried crops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides triggered by severe flooding killed at least five people in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen others were missing, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four people were killed and two others were missing in Wuping county in Fujian province due to landslides caused by torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Severe downpours started on Sunday afternoon, with authorities measuring 372.4 millimetres of rainfall over a 24-hour period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the southwestern Guizhou province, more than 1,100 people were evacuated due to flooding in several counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, northern parts of the country are battling drought, as the country faces two extremes of severe weather. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday hit back at a G7 end-of-summit statement that took aim at China, accusing it of being "full of arrogance, prejudice and lies".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The G7 summit statement once again manipulated China-related issues, slandered and attacked China, rehashed cliches that have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no moral justification, and are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Group of Seven leaders met last week in Italy, souring trade relations with Beijing as well as tensions over Ukraine and the South China Sea were a focus of their discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement released at the end of the summit said China was sending dual-use materials to Russia which were helping Moscow's war in Ukraine. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    China-Australia ties on the right track: Li Qiang

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang, right, shakes hands with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at Parliament House in Canberra. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757760_1_20240617121312.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's relationship with Australia is on the right track, Premier Li Qiang said in Canberra on Monday as the two trading partners moved on from their economic dispute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017, Li held high-level talks with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese following a welcome ceremony at Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In less than one year Prime Minister Albanese and I have met multiple times and exchanged visits to each other's country," Li said following their meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This shows that our countries attach great importance to our relationship and that this relationship is on the right track of steady improvement and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said he and Albanese had a "candid exchange of views on some differences and disagreements", and the two countries have agreed to properly manage those differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier added the further development of bilateral ties requires joint efforts from both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening remarks, Albanese said China and Australia had complementary economies and shared interests in addressing climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have our differences... that's why candid dialogue is so important. For Australia, we consistently advocate the importance of a region and world that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, where countries respect sovereignty and abide by international laws," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia advocates that we should all work together to promote a regional balance where no country dominates and no country is dominated.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting in 2020, a slew of Australia's most lucrative export commodities were effectively banned from China as diplomatic relations rapidly unravelled. But as ties have gradually improved under a new government in Canberra, Beijing has wound back most of these trade barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains overwhelmingly Australia's largest trading partner. Australian farmers, miners and exporters are already seeing the benefits of the removal of trade impediments – benefits that flow to our economy," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also described the discussions with Li as constructive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier Li also said the two countries would expand cooperation in energy and mining, and China would include Australia in its visa waiver programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the two sides will take steps to improve military communication to avoid incidents. "One of the very practical measures that we spoke about was improving military-to-military communication so as to avoid incidents," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an incident last month, a Chinese air force jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter in international airspace over the Yellow Sea. Canberra called it a dangerous encounter whereas the Foreign Ministry in Beijing accused the Australian military of provocative and threatening behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li visited New Zealand before Australia and is scheduled to stop in Malaysia on Tuesday before returning to China. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight people have died of suffocation in a refrigerated truck in Henan province, a local investigation team said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were found unconscious when the vehicle arrived at a petrol station on Saturday evening in Hongzhuangyang Township in Yexian County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims were confirmed dead in the small hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the eight had stayed in the insulated compartment of the vehicle, which was against regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear if they were Chinese nationals or foreigners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The truck driver and other "responsible personnel" have been detained, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the case was being investigated. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang called on Saturday for "shelving differences" with Australia as he launched a visit centred on the promise of economic opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li offered the olive branch after landing in Adelaide for a four-day diplomatic trip, which comes after China lifted trade sanctions against a string of major Australian exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has proven that mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation are the valuable experience in growing China-Australia relations, and must be carried forward," he said in a written arrival statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A more mature, stable and fruitful comprehensive strategic partnership will be a treasure shared by the people of both countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li touched down in Adelaide at the start of his diplomatic mission across the resource-rich continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has gradually removed trade sanctions on wine, timber, barley and beef exports imposed in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with a former conservative government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measures cost Australian exporters an estimated Aus$20 billion (US$13 billion) a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economic relations between the two countries have eased since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach to Beijing. (AFP)

    Rebound in Chinese lending less than expected in May

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New lending by Chinese banks was not as strong as expected in May. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757494_1_20240614211921.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 New bank lending in China rebounded far less than expected in May, and some key money gauges hit record lows, suggesting the world's second-largest economy continued to face headwinds even as the central bank seeks to bolster confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese banks issued 950 billion yuan in new loans last month, compared to 730 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would rise to 1.255 trillion yuan but would still be below the 1.36 trillion yuan issued in May last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China’s credit extension came in lower than expected in May, suggesting that the deleveraging in the households continues," said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhou said China's central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates any time soon, as that could lead to further depreciation of the yuan as the US Federal Reserve seems in no hurry to start cutting its rates, which is buoying the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Balancing all the factors, we think that the PBOC would refrain from policy rate cuts for now but provide more targeted support via relending programmes over the foreseeable future," he said. (Reuters)

    CE confident in GBA opportunities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

 Premier Li Qiang said on Friday that Beijing is willing to make efforts to upgrade the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Addressing a welcome banquet in Auckland held by various social communities on day two of his visit to New Zealand, Li also said the momentum of China's economic recovery has continued to strengthen and consolidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier said the upgrading of China's economic structure will bring new opportunities for global development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will always be open to enterprises from New Zealand and other countries, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier earlier visited the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, a government agency tasked with promoting the country's farming, food and beverage industries, before meetings and a dinner with business people, academics and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mark Piper, the chief executive of a top New Zealand government science institute, was among those meeting Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was talking about more research collaborations and more people exchanges, which is what we're really interested in," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was really big on collaboration, the value that New Zealand can bring to China and that China can bring to New Zealand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li is due to travel to Australia on Saturday. He'll also visit Malaysia as part of his three-nation trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

    China firms apply for EU pork import probe: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757395_1_20240614110707.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firms have formally applied for an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the European Union, the Global Times newspaper said, after the bloc's decision to impose anti-subsidy duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023, including offal, with the EU accounting for more than half, customs data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Global Times report gave no details of the anti-dumping probe, and it was unclear which pork products would be targeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pig parts that are not favoured in Europe such as feet, ears and offal are popular among Chinese consumers, providing a valuable and important market for Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain was China's top supplier last year, followed by Brazil and the United States. Other major suppliers are France, Denmark and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had said it would take "all necessary measures" to safeguard its interests in the wake of the EU decision to slap tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicles made in China, which is due to take effect from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EV tariffs drew a strong rebuke from China as well as European and Chinese car makers, with industry insiders saying both Europe and China have reasons to strike a deal in the months ahead, as the EU process allows for review. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

    Stop turning trade into a political issue: Mofa

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation held steady in May while producer price declines eased, but the underlying trend suggests Beijing would need to do more to prop up weakened domestic demand and an uneven economic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, matching a gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slide in the producer price index eased to 1.4 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, compared with a forecast 1.5 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economy has struggled to gain traction despite the end of stringent pandemic curbs in late 2022, mainly due to the ripple effects of a prolonged property sector crisis on investor, business and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has rolled out several measures to spur demand in the housing sector and launched other schemes to boost consumer sentiment, including offering government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of cars and other consumer goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also vowed to create more jobs linked to major projects, roll out measures to promote domestic demand targeted for youths and has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to shore up growth. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will kick off an overseas visit this week that takes him to New Zealand, Australia and Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the trip will take place from June 13 to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li’s visit to Australia will extend from Saturday to Tuesday and will be the first by a Chinese premier to the country since 2017, in a further indication that strained bilateral relations are improving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trip comes after China lifted most of the trade barriers it had imposed on Australian exports, including coal, timber, barley and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will hold an annual leaders’ meeting in Canberra during the visit. The premier is expected to visit Adelaide and Perth as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia is an important opportunity to engage directly on key issues for both our nations," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is Australia's largest trading partner and our economic relationship continues to bring substantial benefits to both our countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese will also raise the case of writer Yang Hengjun who was given a suspended death sentence in China on espionage charges in February, as well as an incident last month where a Chinese military jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter, which the Australian leader said "was dangerous and should never had happened".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Welcoming the Chinese premier to our shores is an opportunity for Australia to advance our interests by demonstrating our national values, our people's qualities and our economy's strengths," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia continues to pursue a stable and direct relationship with China, with dialogue at its core."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday that Li would visit the country this week, adding that the trip would be a valuable opportunity for exchanges on areas of bilateral cooperation. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources told RTHK that Lai Ka-ying, a police chief inspector, has been selected as the city's first-ever payload specialist in the National Manned Space Programme.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the successful selection of a Hong Kong astronaut in the national space programme marked a “glorious chapter” in the city’s history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after state broadcaster CCTV, quoting the China Manned Space Agency, reported that the 10 people were selected as the fourth batch of national preparatory astronauts, among whom eight were space pilots, and two were payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he felt very excited and encouraged by the selection of a Hong Kong candidate, as he thanked the central government for providing the opportunity for Hongkongers to participate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle that the SAR is eligible for selection in the national space programme, as the programme is a national task.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, [the selection] indicates that the nation attaches great importance to the SAR's technological and innovation development. The SAR government will continue to promote measures to nurture more innovation and technology talent and support the city in becoming an international tech and innovation hub,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Lee, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, also expressed his congratulations, as he pledged the SAR government would do everything possible to assist the candidate successfully complete their training on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know the public is looking forward to knowing about who is selected, but as we know there are many considerations from the nation when selecting preparatory astronauts, and in its usual practice, the nation will only publish the number of the candidates for the time being, and will not reveal the identities of the candidates.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR government will continue to maintain communications with mainland authorities, and publish details in due course,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology chief also noted the candidate was among 120 people who were originally signed up for the recruitment drive in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition to the basic physical and educational requirements, there’s also quite diverse professional requirements in areas including natural science, engineering, biomedics,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While both Lee and Sun did not disclose the Hong Kong astronaut’s identity and other details, sources told RTHK the person selected was Lai Ka-ying, a chief inspector with the Hong Kong Police Force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has a doctoral degree and has three children. She will travel to the mainland for subsequent training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The recruitment of astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau was launched in October 2022, marking the first time the nation’s space programme considered selecting astronauts from the two SARs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three selection rounds have been held since the recruitment drive was launched, and Lee noted the recruitment process was very strict.

 Four American educators from a small university in the state of Iowa were reportedly stabbed in a public park in Jilin province over the weekend, according to US media and US government officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The educators from Cornell College were visiting a partner university in the northeastern province when the attack occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Cornell College spokesperson, the stabbing occurred in Jilin City and the partner school was Beihua University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds wrote on the social media platform X that she was in touch with the US State Department about the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing and was monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the incident was a random attack and would "not affect normal people-to-people exchanges between China and the United States". (Reuters)

    China team gears up for Paris Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's sports officials say the national team's performance during the coming Olympics will be "worth looking forward to," although they are faced with more challenges than previous games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Administration of Sport of China said it expects athletes to compete in around 210 out of the 329 events at the Paris Olympics next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the national team would take part in all events in diving, weightlifting, shooting, gymnastics, table tennis and badminton – sports that the country is traditionally strong at.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Lingfeng, who heads the training division of the competitive sports department of the body, said the team was making its final preparations for Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the time difference and other factors would not be favourable for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are perfectly aware that the difficulties and challenges at the Paris Olympics are far greater than those before," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of our athletic skills in some gold-winning events has dropped as we're transitioning from one generation of athletes to another."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang noted the United States, which has topped the gold medal table at world tournaments in the past, continues to be one of the main competitors, while other countries are also improving quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the official said the national team has what it takes to achieve "outstanding results" in the French capital after preparing for the games for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they have also been working to instil patriotism into athletes and coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been educating the national team... to further solidify their confidence and determination to attain good results at the Paris Olympics and bring glory to the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said doing well at the Olympics is important to turn China into a country that excels at sports.

    NSL demonstrates HK's constitutional duty: Zheng

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong to curb disorder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Zheng Yanxiong said a dual legislation and dual enforcement mechanism between the SAR and the mainland was established after the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It demonstrates the SAR's constitutional duty. It shows that Hong Kong's mechanisms for safeguarding national security and enforcement have improved, while addressing previous shortcomings - and ensuring that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle is on the right track," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that 45 out of 47 defendants were convicted in a subversion case after they were involved in an unofficial legislative primary election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different sectors generally affirmed the ruling, believed that it disseminated correct messages on the rule of law, showed the determination and confidence of the society in safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the National Security Law had been effective in improving governance and creating prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past four years, Hong Kong has made a significant transformation from chaos to governance, returning to the track of development. In March, Hong Kong completed legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, further solidifying the legal shield for safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong National Security Law explicitly identifies its purpose as maintaining the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR, highlighting this original aspiration to protect development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government Dong Jingwei said the central government has full trust in the SAR government, authorising it to have the responsibility for safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the central government would deal with any problems that the SAR government finds difficult to handle.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from CUHK. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756593_2_20240608080909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Olympic Games less than two months away, dedicated Hong Kong-trained specialists are working tirelessly to ensure the country's elite athletes stay injury-free and perform at their very best in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For trainer Ivy Lui, a career highlight came when Liu Yang, one of the Chinese gymnasts she worked with, secured the gold medal on rings at last year’s World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I felt like my dreams from graduation have come true,” she said. “I knew I wanted to help an athlete achieve an honour at the international stage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gymnast also won gold in rings at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so he'll be defending his title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui's journey as a sports therapist began eight years ago when she graduated from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, a member institution of the Vocational Training Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending time with the Hong Kong Rugby Union, she began working with the gymnastics team in Guangzhou before joining the national gymnastics team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her days involve giving massages to the gymnasts, to help them relax after training sessions, and treating any injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her work goes beyond physical therapy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To ensure comprehensive preparation, we also recreate a live atmosphere and simulate actual playing time during our gym training sessions in China before going overseas,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dedicated professional Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from the Chinese University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang was already working with the national rugby team before he went on to pursue an advanced degree in Hong Kong, so he would have a deeper understanding of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The one-year study made my work more systematic,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we use force platforms to test athletes, which can indicate whether there’s discrepancy in their leg strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there is a big discrepancy, we will strengthen the weaker leg to prevent injuries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of Wang's key tasks is to make sure China's men and women rugby teams stay in top form, as they try to book a ticket to Paris through a qualification tournament later this month.

 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Russia next week for a gathering of counterparts from the Brics group of emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang will meet with other foreign ministers for talks "on issues of common concern such as Brics cooperation and current and regional situations", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said that Brics is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries and that members "have always been committed to safeguarding multilateralism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting takes place on Monday and Tuesday in western Russia's Nizhny Novgorod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to work "to consolidate the Brics strategic relations, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, (and) promote shared development and joint self-reliance in the global South", Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bloc, its name derived from the initials of founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced last year a major expansion in membership, described at the time by President Xi Jinping as "historic". (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)

    China women's hockey team hopeful for an Olympic medal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's women's hockey team has set their sights on a podium spot at this year's Olympics, even though they have a tough road ahead to clinch a medal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Preparations have been underway for the Paris Games, with the team recently spending almost two months in the Australian city of Perth for a training programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhong Jiaqi, who's playing in her second Olympics, said the squad is more prepared this time than during the Tokyo Games in 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we are more confident, and the whole team is in a very good condition,” Zhong said. “It could be because our result in the last Olympics was not satisfactory, so we want this year's Games to be good.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow teammate and defender Zheng Jiali, who is representing China for the first time at the Olympics, said the team is aiming for gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have strengthened techniques and strategies, as well as our fitness. There are overall changes and adjustments,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team achieved its best Olympic result on home soil during the 2008 Beijing Games, where they took silver. One of their coaches, Huang Yongsheng, said the team's success does not stop there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Whether it's 2008 or after 2008, the goal of the women's hockey team has never changed. We strive to do our best and always work to achieve the best results,” Huang said. “I feel like [the achievement in] 2008 is not our endpoint, it is just a starting point.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two years ago, Australia’s two-time Olympic gold medalist Alyson Annan took charge of the Chinese squad, and coach Huang said it has helped the team grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She brought some pioneering concepts from the West, merging them with what we already had in China, in the hope of better techniques and tactics that fit China more," Huang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team faces an uphill battle in Paris, having been placed in the same group as reigning Olympic champions the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other teams in the same group include Belgium, Germany, Japan and hosts France.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team manager Guo Hong said he is certain the team will give their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Everyone has an Olympic dream. But I think we should be realistic and do things gradually,” Guo said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There will be more cooperation between the creative industries in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau, Culture Secretary Kevin Yeung said on Thursday at an annual meeting on cultural exchanges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “This year's meeting has been very successful, with many collaborative projects showing positive development. It's very encouraging,” he said at the 22nd Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope that this conference framework will guide cultural exchange and cooperation between the three regions, and elevate the depth and breadth of our collaboration to a new level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that over the next five years, the SAR government will allocate HK$135 million to support local art groups and artists in exchange programmes within the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are also plans to bring more local cultural events, including the Hong Kong Pop Culture Festival, to the bay area, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guangdong’s culture and tourism director general, Li Bin, said creating a well-known cultural tourism brand in the region is a collective effort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that promotions for art performances and exhibitions will be more closely connected, with more interactions among official accounts on WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Macau’s cultural affairs minister, Leong Wai-man, said the city hosted over 2,000 large-scale performances and more than 10,000 cultural events last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Macau could play the role as a major entertainment hub in the bay area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the men's and women's national rugby sevens teams are preparing to contend for the final berth at the Olympics next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They will have to win the repechage tournament in Monaco at the end of the month for the trip to Paris and are among 12 entries battling for the last spots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's team are in the same pool with Canada, Great Britain and Uganda, while the women's squad face Poland, Czech Republic and Mexico in pool play.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's assistant coach, Zhu Jing, said the most important thing is for the team to fight as one on the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said even though other countries are traditionally considered stronger in rugby sevens, Asians, like Chinese, also have their own advantages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of potential, actually Chinese people have quite an advantage. Because we have speed and agility. When we play we are actually better in these attributes compared to players from Europe or the Americas," Zhu told Hong Kong reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach said he's looking forward to seeing good performances from a couple of players. He said Shan Changshun and the captain, Li Haitao, have good physique and awareness on the pitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li, for his part, said the team was focusing on improving their fitness ahead of the do-or-die tournament, as well as working on tactical adjustments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Making the Olympics for sure is every athlete's ultimate dream. We'll do our best yeah, do our best to get that ticket to Paris," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're all in good shape, training with great enthusiasm. Also, in everyday life we're all very united as a team."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the players were having extra sessions in the weight room, and the sports science team has helped their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added he thinks the team's biggest foes are themselves, and all they need to do is to give it their best shot.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tickets for new overnight high-speed trains to the mainland went on sale on Wednesday, with the first service to Beijing selling out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains to the capital and Shanghai will run Friday-Monday from June 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Queues for tickets formed at West Kowloon Station, while mainland app 12306 showed no places left for the first train to Beijing, although people could join a wait list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were really happy when we saw the news [regarding the new services], so we immediately decided to travel to Shanghai," a woman told RTHK at West Kowloon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The journey time was 19 hours before, and it's only 11 hours now. The duration is eight hours shorter," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another woman said she arrived at the station 90 minutes before tickets went on sale, to book a spot on a train to Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the price, it's a bit expensive. Our tickets cost one thousand dollars each. But it's not convenient for us to travel by plane. We're old people," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man said he normally drives to the mainland, but wants to try the overnight train instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Basically, I have to go to Beijing once a year and I like trying new things," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Rising Chinese long jump star Zhang Mingkun said he is determined not to let the pressure get to him as he seeks qualification for the upcoming Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old said he is going to keep his mind at ease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During a jump, your mind really goes blank. All you do is to enjoy it,” Zhang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The long jumper, who has a personal record of 8.13m, has been striving to reach the 8.27m entry standard for the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He'll find out in about a month's time on whether his dream would come true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for the rest of the track and field team, the sprinters have been training with a new foreign coach ahead of the Games, and they see the benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Here, our training is relatively traditional... but it’s more scientific overseas,” said runner Wang Shuang from Jiangsu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Female sprinter Huang Ziting knows that the odds are against them, but reaching the Olympic stage remains the ultimate goal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m certain every athlete would want to stand on the Olympic podium, but it feels like it would be more difficult for Asians [to achieve that],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sprinter, Chen Jinfeng, said getting to Paris requires not only strong performances but a bit of luck as well.

 The MTR said tickets for overnight high-speed trains between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong would be available for sale from Wednesday noon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overnight trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and West Kowloon Station from June 15 from Fridays to Mondays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR said tickets would be available from Wednesday noon on the mainland's 12306 ticketing website or mobile app, and at ticket counters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fares for one-way trips between Hong Kong and Beijing would be approximately between HK$937 and HK$1,448, while those between Hong Kong and Shanghai would be approximately between HK$682 and HK$2,128.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung welcomed the new arrangements which enhanced the services provided by the Hong Kong section of the express rail link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new sleeper trains...tailored to meet the passenger needs and provide them with a more convenient, comfortable and high-quality cross-boundary rail service, enhancing the travel experience for both business and leisure passengers," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Beijing resident said the new arrangement further encouraged him to visit Hong Kong one day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't like to travel by plane, so if high-speed trains have sleeping coaches, I won't feel tired even it's a long trip," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who's visiting Hong Kong, said she could manage time better if she travelled by high-speed trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Due to weather conditions these days, the situation of flight delays is very serious. My flight was delayed for almost eight hours, so travelling by high-speed trains may be more convenient," she said.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said overnight high-speed trains would operate between Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong from June 15, making transportation more convenient and cost-effective for passengers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Intercity passenger services, running at normal speed, used to carry travellers between Hung Hom and mainland cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but all services were suspended following the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said high-speed trains would be used to replace the normal-speed trains, and trains would run to and from West Kowloon Station instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the overnight trains would run from Friday to Monday, and would feature sleeping coaches for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are departures at night time, meaning that you board the train at night, and you arrive at your destination the next morning. Passengers spend the evening on the train, and there are also sleeping coaches, so after a night's sleep, you will arrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's very convenient, with a shortened journey time. You cut your travelling time by about 12 hours. You can also save on hotel accommodation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the journey time for overnight trains from West Kowloon Station to Shanghai and Beijing would be about 11 hours and 12.5 hours respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people would also be able to travel between Hong Kong and Hunan Province from June 15, with six new destinations including Zhangjiajie and Fenghuang Ancient Town.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there would be more short-haul train services as well.

    Chang'e-6 lunar probe successfully lifts off from moon

<div class="itemFullText">
 China said a spacecraft carrying rock and soil samples from the far side of the moon lifted off from the lunar surface on Tuesday to start its journey back to Earth.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ascender of the Chang’e-6 probe lifted off and entered a preset orbit around the moon, the China National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner -- like its predecessor Chang'e-5 -- was launched on May 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its lander-ascender combination touched down at the designated landing area in the South Pole-Aitken Basin on June 2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Missions to the moon’s far side are more difficult because it doesn’t face the Earth, requiring a relay satellite to maintain communications. The terrain is also more rugged, with fewer flat areas to land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During its mission, the probe adopted two methods of moon sampling, including using a drill to collect subsurface samples and grabbing samples on the surface with a robotic arm. It automatically gathered diverse samples at different sites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples collected will be transferred to a reentry capsule that is due to return to Earth in the Inner Mongolia region on June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mission is the sixth in the Chang’e moon exploration program, which is named after a Chinese moon goddess. It is the second designed to bring back samples, following the Chang’e-5, which did so from the near side in 2020. (Xinhua/AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three of China's top gymnasts said they have different ways of dealing with the pressure that comes with intense training ahead of the Paris Olympics, as they shared with RTHK their journeys to reach the highest level of their sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xiao Ruoteng, who won silver in the individual all-around and bronze in the floor event at the Tokyo Olympics, said he has been battling injuries, including shoulder, wrist and ankle problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 28-year-old stressed the importance of pushing himself to the limit, adding that he still sees himself as a young athlete hungry for success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no going back if we want to get to the top. We have to do what ordinary people can't do... Although this will be my second time at the Olympics and people might think I'm experienced... my mentality is that of a first-time Olympian. I'm excited about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xiao noted that the national team would focus on the team competition as a crucial opportunity to win the gold medal, which will then give them momentum in the subsequent individual events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou Jingyuan won gold on the parallel bars at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zou acknowledged the pressure that comes with being in the spotlight, but said he got help from his teammates in handling that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are all under pressure. Athletes need confidence during competitions, regardless of the pressure. Other athletes are under pressure too and I try to learn from my teammates. If they can handle it well, what can I do to be like them?" he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Qiu Qiyuan, a promising 16-year-old specialising in the uneven bars, said support from her coach and family helped her overcome the pressure and injuries she has faced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The pressure is definitely there, but we have to turn that pressure into motivation because if we can't take that pressure, there's no way we're going to fight for Olympic gold," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had this injury two years ago and I had an operation. It's not a big problem. I'm recovering well. Now I have adjusted mentally. My coach and my family are helping and encouraging me."

<div class="itemFullText">
 China believes all efforts should be recognised in supporting peace measures around the Russia-Ukraine war, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China has never "fanned fire or fuelled the flames", said Mao Ning, addressing a question on a peace summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a report, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia and China of attempting to undermine his planned global peace summit in Switzerland in mid-June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China attaches great importance to its relations with Ukraine and remains its largest trading partner, Mao said, adding that China's position on the peace conference is very "open and transparent".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that we can get the understanding and support of all parties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland is seeking a broad-based turnout from different parts of the world for the summit, which Bern hopes will lay the groundwork for a peace process in Ukraine. (Reuters)

    National team eye sweep of Olympic diving golds

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will be looking to complete a sweep of the gold medals in diving in the upcoming Paris Olympics, after falling just short in Tokyo three years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Zongyuan, who took gold in the men's synchronised 3m springboard at the Tokyo Games, said the national team are training hard, both physically and mentally, so they would make waves again in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China came first in seven of eight diving events in Tokyo, and Wang said it's the national team's dream to do even better this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, it is the entire diving team's dream to win all eight gold medals at the Olympics, but we have to do our best and work hard to keep on polishing our technique with just two short months before the Games begin," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That way, we can thrive in the face of pressure and perform to the best of our abilities to hopefully capture those eight medals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teenager Quan Hongchan, meanwhile, will be looking to defend her 10m platform title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Guangdong native, as a 14-year-old, secured three perfect 10s to finish with an Olympic record 466.20 points in Tokyo, more than 40 points ahead of compatriot and silver medallist Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan said she will perform to the best of her ability in Paris, adding that a gold for either her or teammate Chen will bring honour to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For now, what I mainly want to do is perform my best dive, and not think of other issues. I will just think about my movements, how to do it, and how to dive well," Quan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, I do have confidence. No matter who wins gold between the two of us, as long as it’s a Chinese winning, that’ll be fine.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen, who brought home a gold in the synchronised 10m platform event with Zhang Jiaqi in Tokyo, said members of the national diving team are very supportive of one another.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since everyone is representing China, we should collectively aim to bring glory to our country. Whether it’s an individual or a pair event, we should fight hard and aim to bring honour together," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the Olympics, we hope that everyone on the team can show their capabilities, their strength and their spirit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three athletes said their families, friends and fans have all been a big part of their athletic careers, so they want to do well to repay them.

    'Beijing committed to peaceful reunification'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Defence minister Dong Jun on Sunday said Beijing is committed to a peaceful reunification, calling the Taiwan issue a “core of core interests” for China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue conference in Singapore, Dong said the island’s Democratic Progressive Party was “pursuing separation in an incremental way” and was “bent on erasing the Chinese identity of Taiwan”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “China stays committed to peaceful reunification, however, this prospect is increasingly being eroded by separatists for ‘Taiwan independence’ and foreign forces. The danger of national division is still there,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Chinese People’s Liberation Army will remain a strong force for upholding national reunification. We will take resolute actions to curb ‘Taiwan independence‘ and make sure such a plot never succeeds.“
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Anyone who dares to separate Taiwan from China will only end up in self destruction,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Dong told the security conference that China's military wants more military exchanges with the United States. His comments came after the first face-to-face talks in eighteen months between Chinese and US defence chiefs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that many countries were closely monitoring Beijing's relationship with Washington.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we see it, it is because the two militaries have differences that there is a greater need for communication," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though we have different development paths, we should not pursue confrontation with each other."

 The national space agency announced early on Sunday that the Change'e-6 craft has touched down on the far side of the moon in a historic first for China’s space programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The craft landed at the South Pole-Aitken Basin shortly before 6.30am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Change'e-6 will collect rocks and soil from the lunar surface for return to earth, the first time the moon’s far side has been studied in this way. The mission blasted off from the Wenchang base on Hainan Island a month ago.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Friday said it would be "difficult" for it to take part in a planned conference on the war in Ukraine in June if Russia did not attend.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ukraine is trying to whip up attendance at the peace conference in Switzerland, where it hopes to win broad international backing for its vision of the terms needed to end the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged China to take part but Beijing insisted any summit would need the participation of Russia, which Ukraine has rejected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing believes the conference "should have the recognition of Russia and Ukraine, equal participation of all parties and fair discussion of all peace plans", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a regular news conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, it is difficult for the conference to play a substantive role in restoring peace," she said. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese and American defence chiefs held talks in Singapore on Friday, offering hopes for more military dialogue that could help prevent disputes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Defence Minister Dong Jun met with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the first meeting between the defence chiefs of the two countries since 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dong and Austin began the talks at the luxury hotel hosting the security forum, a member of the US delegation told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of China-US relations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides agreed after a summit between President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden in November last year to restart high-level military talks. That includes a communications channel between the US Indo-Pacific Command chief and Chinese commanders responsible for military operations near Taiwan, Japan and in the South China Sea. (Agencies)

 Visitors to Spain's Madrid Zoo Aquarium were on Thursday introduced to a giant panda couple from China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Male Jin Xi and female Zhu Yu, both born in 2020, arrived last month at the zoo following the renewal of its agreement for giant panda protection with the China Wildlife Conservation Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They completed a smooth quarantine period before making their debut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sofia, the former queen of Spain, hosted the official introduction of the three-year-old bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are proud to host this unique species and to contribute to its preservation," Madrid mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Ambassador to Spain, Yao Jing, highlighted that "the friendly bond" created by the pandas would unite the two peoples and serve as "an important symbol of China-Spain friendship."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the debut of the giant panda couple, visitors to the zoo can now participate in educational activities every weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We try to bring information about pandas to the public so they can know pandas better and how we can protect the species," zoo staff Luis Manchado, who is responsible for the educational section, told Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two pandas are set to remain in Spain for the next 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has loaned its treasured bears to overseas zoos over the years as goodwill ambassadors, while also running conservation programmes back home that have seen their status improve from endangered to vulnerable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There are 728 pandas in zoos and breeding centres around the world.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China says it will halt tariff concessions from June 15 for some Taiwan products that currently enjoy preferential tariff rates stipulated in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), in response to the island's trade restrictions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement was made on Friday by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The special rates will be removed from 134 goods, including machine tools and industrial chemicals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China in December suspended tariff concessions for some products under the ECFA, but the Finance Ministry said the island has not reciprocated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Taiwan region has unilaterally adopted discriminatory measures such as prohibiting and restricting the export of mainland products, which violates the provisions of the (agreement)," the ministry said. (Xinhua & agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Thursday hit out against foreign criticism of the landmark court ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a regular press briefing in the capital, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Beijing strenuously opposes attempts by foreign countries to use this case to interfere in China’s internal affairs and smear Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No one can engage in unlawful activities in the name of democracy and then try to escape legal sanctions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokeswoman added that the central government firmly supports the SAR’s law enforcement and judicial authorities in fulfilling their duties in accordance with the law and punishing acts that violated national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her remarks came after the United States, European Union and Australia described the trial as being "politically motivated", and called for those convicted to be immediately released.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  14 people were convicted earlier in the day of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law, after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by plotting to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two others were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  31 other defendants, meanwhile, had already pleaded guilty in the case.

 President Xi Jinping on Thursday announced that China would host the second China-Arab States Summit in 2026, adding it would be another milestone in Beijing's relations with the Middle East region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the announcement as he delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the 10th ministerial meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing.

  Addressing the delegations, Xi said China supported a "broad-based" peace conference to resolve the conflict.

    Two giant pandas to head to US

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A giant panda at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, DC, in 2022. Two other giant pandas are heading to Washington's National Zoo later in the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China will return giant pandas to Washington's National Zoo by the end of the year, US First Lady Jill Biden and officials said on Wednesday in a surprise announcement signalling a new era of panda diplomacy between the two superpowers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We are excited for children near and far to once again enjoy the giant pandas' adorable and joyful adventures at our @NationalZoo," the first lady posted on X.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing will send a new pair called Bao Li and Qing Bao under a 10-year breeding and research agreement, the zoo said in a statement, hailing a "historic moment" that demonstrated the benefits of its partnership with Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, DC," said Brandie Smith of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, only a handful of the iconic black and white bears remain in the US, with three having left the national zoo in Washington six months ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But President Xi Jinping said after meeting President Joe Biden at a summit in California last November that China could send new pandas as "envoys of friendship between the Chinese and American people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The White House said it would be happy to have more bamboo-chewing bears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been using so-called "panda diplomacy" since 1972, when the first animals were sent to the United States as a gift, following then-president Richard Nixon's historic visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Strained relations between the rival superpowers in recent years have led Beijing to call some of the pandas back home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All three giant pandas at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington – Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, who arrived in 2000, and their three-year-old cub Xiao Qi Ji ("Little Miracle" in English) – flew back on a cargo plane to China in November last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The currently last remaining pandas in the US, at a zoo in the southern city of Atlanta, are due to return to China later this year, although China announced plans in February to send a new pair of giant pandas to the San Diego Zoo. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Egypt on Wednesday signed agreements deepening their cooperation during President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's visit to Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping and his Egyptian counterpart witnessed the signing in a ceremony that coincided with the 10th anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China and Egypt discussed bilateral relations and bringing stability to the Middle East in light of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, according to a statement released by the Egyptian presidency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused a large number of innocent Palestinian civilian casualties and the humanitarian situation in Gaza is extremely severe. China is deeply pained," Xi told el-Sisi, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The top priority task now is an immediate ceasefire, in order to avoid spillover of conflict, impact on regional peace and stability, and so as to prevent a more serious humanitarian crisis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi added that China is ready to work with Egypt to continue to assist the people of Gaza "and push for an early, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Egypt, along with Qatar and the United States, have been engaged for months in talks aimed at securing a lasting truce between Israel and Hamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreements signed between Beijing and Cairo on Wednesday include collaboration in the Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state projects, including the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital east of Cairo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Investments between the two countries amounted to around US$14 billion in 2023, compared to US$16.6 billion in 2022, according to the latest data released by Egypt’s statistics agency.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund on Wednesday raised its 2024 growth forecast for China to five percent, citing recent policy moves by Beijing to boost the nation's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "China's economic growth is projected to remain resilient at five percent in 2024 and slow to 4.5 percent in 2025," the IMF said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision was "driven by strong first-quarter GDP data and recent policy measures", it added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fund had initially projected 4.6 percent growth for this year – compared with "around five percent" targeted by authorities in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IMF also welcomed official steps in recent weeks to boost the housing market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The ongoing housing market correction, which is necessary for steering the sector towards a more sustainable path, should continue," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But, it added that "a more comprehensive policy package would facilitate an efficient and less costly transition while safeguarding against downside risks". (AFP)

 President Xi Jinping has called for efforts to promote high-quality and sufficient employment, and to further boost employment through development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks on Monday while presiding over a Politburo group study session, Xinhua news agency reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We should] insist that employment of young people including college graduates is a top priority," Xi told the session. China is expected to see over 11.7 million college graduates this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president also said measures should be taken to promote the employment of migrant workers, stabilise the number and income of people who were lifted out of poverty, and provide more help to groups that find it difficult to secure employment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called for efforts to deepen the reform of employment systems and mechanisms, and protect the rights and interests of workers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Tuesday expressed "grave concern" over Israel's military operations in Rafah, where an Israeli strike killed dozens in a displaced persons camp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning also said China urged "all parties to protect civilians and civilian facilities".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing also said it "strongly urges Israel to listen to the appeals of the international community and to stop its attacks on Rafah".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been calling for an immediate ceasefire since the start of the current Israel-Hamas war in October last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, President Xi Jinping has called for an international peace conference to resolve the fighting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN Security Council was set to convene an emergency meeting later on Tuesday over Israel's operations in the southern Gaza border city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An Israeli attack targeting two senior Hamas members on Sunday night sparked a fire that ripped through a displacement centre, killing 45, according to Gaza health officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attack prompted a wave of international condemnation. Israel said it was looking into the "tragic accident".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The war in Gaza began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing at least 1,200 civilians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 36,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the territory's health ministry run by Hamas. (AFP)
