<div class="itemFullText">
 Japanese academic Seiyo Matsuno has released a new book on clandestine operations by Japanese forces during World War II, opting to publish it on the 87th anniversary of the Marco Bridge Incident.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Known locally as the Lugou Bridge Incident, it took place on July 7, 1937 when Japanese forces attacked Chinese troops on the bridge in the outskirts of Beijing. The incident is recognised as the beginning of Japan's full-scale invasion of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The book, 'Materials Related to Imperial Japanese Army Noborito Research Institute', includes 125 documents and over 1,500 original historical records compiled over a five-year period by the academic at Meiji Gakuin University's International Peace Research Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also known as the Army Ninth Technical Research Institute, the Noborito Research Institute was formerly the Army Science Research Institute. Its main focus was on espionage, assassination techniques, counterfeiting currency, and creating balloon bombs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Explaining his choice of release date, Matsuno told Xinhua that publishing on July 7 embodied his heartfelt wish that such unfortunate historical events should never be repeated. (With additional reporting from Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry announced on Friday that it will hold an anti-dumping hearing on brandy imported from the European Union on July 18.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hearing will be about "industrial damage, cause and effect, and public interest in the anti-dumping probe of related brandy products", Xinhua News Agency quoted an online statement by the ministry as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing aims to ensure that the investigation procedure is fair, just and transparent, said the statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's anti-dumping probe into EU brandy products would look at EU-produced brandy in containers holding less than 200 litres imported from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023, the ministry has said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It would also investigate any damage done to the Chinese brandy industry from January 1, 2019 to September 30, 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The probe is expected to end before January 5, 2025, but may be extended for half a year under special circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The announcement by the Commerce Ministry comes as the European Commission's provisional tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel its EV tariffs, expressing a willingness to negotiate. It has said it does not want to be embroiled in another tariff war, but that it would take all steps to protect Chinese firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has also opened investigations into European pork imports. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Thursday called on the members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to ensure security in the face of real threat from the Cold War mentality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi made the remarks when attending the SCO summit in the Kazakh capital of Astana.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the member states to adhere to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address complex and intertwined security challenges through dialogue and coordination, and respond to the profoundly changing international landscape with a win-win approach, so as to build a world of lasting peace and universal security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the world is faced with accelerating changes unseen in a century, the human society is standing at a crossroads of history again, Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president pointed out that the SCO stands on the right side of history, fairness and justice, and is of great significance to the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SCO members should consolidate unity and jointly oppose external interference in the face of the real challenges of interference and division, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasised the group's focus on ensuring security of its members, and said the SCO will form a dedicated centre that will coordinate response to various security challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group's members will also endorse a special program to fight separatism and extremism. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday hailed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a force for global stability at a summit of the regional body in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their second meeting in as many months, Xi told Putin that China and Russia should "uphold the original aspiration of friendship for generations" in response to an "ever-changing international situation".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling Putin an "old friend", Xi alluded to the progress the two countries had made in putting in place "plans and arrangements for the next development of bilateral relations".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president said the two sides should continuously conserve the unique value in China-Russia relations, and explore the internal driving force of bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Putin said the SCO has “firmly established itself as one of the key pillars of a fair, multipolar world order", adding that bilateral ties between Moscow and Beijing were at their best in history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our cooperation is not aimed against anyone, we are not creating any blocs or alliances, we are just acting in the interests of our peoples," Putin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Putin's spokesman later told state TV that the two leaders discussed Ukraine and agreed that peace talks without Russia's presence were futile. (Agencies)

 President Xi Jinping left Beijing on Tuesday for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and state visits to Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Xi's entourage includes Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written statement upon his arrival in the Kazakh capital of Astana later in the day, the president said he looks forward to attending the SCO summit and discussing with all parties the future of the organisation and ways to advance cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said China and Kazakhstan have established a unique permanent comprehensive strategic partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will discuss with his SCO colleagues development blueprints and build consensus on cooperation in the two-day summit that opened on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During Xi's trip to Kazakhstan – his fifth – he will also attend various state events, including a welcoming ceremony, signing ceremony and a banquet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will hold "in depth" talks with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev "on bilateral relations, cooperation in key areas, and the regional and international landscape", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xi will then head to Tajikistan for his second state visit to China's western neighbour, where he will "make new plans for the growth of China-Tajikistan relations" with President Emomali Rahmon, Mao added. (Xinhua/AFP)

    'Soft opening would have eased gridlock on new link'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link should have had a soft opening to reduce the mega infrastructure project's novelty factor, according to the CEO of a transport consultancy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new 24-kilometre link across the Pearl River Delta opened on Sunday but traffic was gridlocked as many drivers stopped on the bridge to take photos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of the congestion we are seeing at the moment, those are just novelty factors," said Alok Jai, CEO of Trans-Consult, on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And normally when we open infrastructure like that, usually you should have a soft opening - which gives people the chance to take pictures and look around and appreciate it - before you do the full opening, or proper opening, then it becomes a proper transport linkage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in the gridlock. One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain welcomed the link, saying it would take pressure off the Humen Bridge at the north of the Pearl River Delta and improve connectivity within the region. But he said he didn't think it would cut journey times between Shenzhen and Zhongshan to 30 minutes from two hours, which had been widely reported ahead of the opening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is certainly going to reduce it by 45 minutes or so. But that in itself - as far as we talk about the connectivity within the Pearl River Delta, or the Greater Bay Area - that is a significant saving in journey times," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jain also said he expected the new link to take traffic away from the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which is more expensive. He said Hongkongers heading to Zhongshan may opt for the new link instead of going via Zhuhai. But he said the main beneficiaries would be those living in the Shenzhen or Zhongshan areas and those using the Humen Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link consists of two bridges, two artificial islands and an under-sea tunnel.

    'Do more to ease traffic on Shenzhen-Zhongshan link'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport sector representatives have called on mainland officials to do more to smooth out traffic on the new Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, after commuters experienced much longer journey times than expected amid heavy congestion on its opening day on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new mega-project - which comprises two bridges, two artificial islands, and a tunnel – was supposed to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But many people, including visitors from Hong Kong who took an inaugural trip over the link on Sunday, were stuck in a gridlock for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, lawmaker Gary Zhang, said it took him six hours to get from Kwun Tong to Zhongshan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some vehicles stopped on the bridge and people were taking photos. There should have been four lanes available, but when the problem was at its peak, there were only two," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The traffic capacity was reduced by half, leading to traffic congestion. Transport departments and officers could have done better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, pointed out that it took him about five hours to reach Shenzhen from Zhongshan on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he believes mainland authorities will handle the issue by, for example, banning commuters from taking photos on bridges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will keep an eye on the situation for one or two more weeks. I will also see what happens this coming Saturday and Sunday," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will make decisions on tour group arrangements depending on the traffic situation, especially for those heading to the west side of the Pearl River Delta. I think we'll have to keep things flexible and people on tours should be aware of this."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach operator Eternal East Bus, meanwhile, said it anticipates a 30 percent jump in passenger numbers with the opening of the new link, and will increase the frequency of buses to Zhongshan accordingly.

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link officially opens

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Sunday welcomed the opening of a road link that spans the Pearl River Delta and connects Shenzhen with Zhongshan, saying that it helps to promote market integration in the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Shenzhen-Zhongshan link, which opened on Sunday afternoon, is expected to cut the journey time between the two cities to 30 minutes from two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, traffic jams at both ends of the link marred the first day of operation, and some people complained the journey took much longer than expected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi said it's necessary to ensure the link is safe and smooth, and that it will help integrate the eastern and western sides of the Pearl River Delta.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Timothy Chui, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, said he expects it to be a popular tourist spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One out of two enquiries have been asking about the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link for single-day or multi-day tour groups. Customers hope to go to Zhongshan, Shunde or Gudou and spend three days there," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man travelling to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong by tour bus said he now expects the journey to be more convenient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I travelled to Zhongshan from Kwun Tong before, I had to go via Shenzhen Bay and Humen. It took me five-and-a-half hours. I want to see whether taking the link will cut my journey time," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A restaurant manager in Zhongshan said he expects business to increase after the opening of the transport link.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong tour groups contribute to half of our sales for group dining. After the opening of the link, many travel agencies, which didn't previously partner with us, also came to our restaurant to have a look at the environment and the food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The link is 24 kilometres in length and consists of two bridges, two artificial islands, and a two-way, eight-lane tunnel.

    Mixed reactions to increase in duty-free allowance

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There have been mixed reactions to an increase in the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau, with some welcoming the move and others saying it doesn't go far enough.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Friday, Beijing announced that it will increase the allowance from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Tsim Sha Tsui, a mainland tourist said he hopes to see the allowance increased further because he normally spends around 100,000 yuan in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope it can be raised to 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, because women’s bags usually cost around that. Also, large jewellery and cosmetics items almost always cost more than ten thousand dollars," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Central, a visitor from Shenzhen said he will spend more in the SAR after the measure takes effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the original limit of 5,000 yuan is not enough because many electronic products cost more than 5,000 yuan... This adjustment will greatly stimulate mainland consumers' purchasing power," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shanghai tourist said the increase won't make a difference to him, because he's only in Hong Kong to watch a concert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It doesn't really affect me because I don't buy much in Hong Kong. And now prices in Hong Kong are probably similar to the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Retail Management Association said the measure is an important step forward and it hopes the SAR government will continue to pay attention to the needs and development of the industry.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's Chang'e-6 mission collected 1,935.3 grams of samples from the far side of the moon, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) announced on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration handed over the sample container to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) at a ceremony held in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the event, the spokesperson for the Chang'e-6 mission Ge Ping told reporters that "we have found that the samples brought back by Chang'e-6 were more viscous compared to previous samples, with the presence of clumps".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers will carry out the storage and processing of the samples as planned and initiate scientific research.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The samples, collected from the far side of the moon for the first time in human history, hold unique scientific significance as they will further enhance the understanding of lunar evolution, accelerate the pace of peaceful exploration and utilisation of lunar resources, and serve as an important asset for all humanity, CNSA said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 probe was launched on May 3. Its returner, carrying the lunar samples, landed in its designated area in Inner Mongolia on June 25, marking a complete success for the mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The returner safely arrived in Beijing later. Researchers opened it and successfully collected the lunar sample container on Wednesday, according to CNSA. (Xinhua)

    'Higher duty-free limit will boost HK retail'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Politicians and industry representatives on Friday welcomed Beijing's move to raise the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Mainland authorities announced that the limit will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person at several border crossings from July 1, and at all checkpoints from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, told reporters that the move will boost the city's retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that with this initiative, tourists from the mainland can shop more freely and it can benefit our various industries, especially the retail industry," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that local authorities have to do their part to make the SAR a more attractive place for tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the two sessions in Beijing in March, delegates to the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) signed a petition asking for the duty-free allowance to be increased to 30,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, a CPPCC Standing Committee member, said the increase announced is a "good beginning", even though it's lower than the amount proposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This arrangement is exclusive. This arrangement is fair to both parties, and this arrangement can be adjusted going forward. And at the same time, it will be a boost to our retail industry and to our tourism industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation also welcomed Beijing's move, adding that the SAR government can work with malls to promote Hong Kong as a "shopping paradise".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Tourism Board, meanwhile, said it will hand out 500,000 sets of offers worth more than HK$100 million to overnight visitors to Hong Kong starting from July 11, including sightseeing, transport, dining and consumption discounts.

 Beijing on Friday announced that the duty-free shopping allowance for mainland tourists returning from Hong Kong and Macau will be increased from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan per person.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People who buy goods at duty-free stores at border crossings will continue to get an extra allowance of 3,000 yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The change will take effect on July 1 at Lo Wu, Futian, Shenzhen Bay, West Kowloon Station, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and Gongbei.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The policy will be implemented at all border crossings from August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said the new arrangements would raise local spending by HK$8.8 billion to HK$17.6 billion and generate added value of about HK$2.7 billion to HK$5.4 billion to the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the move, saying it shows the central government's support for Hong Kong's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new measure will enhance the shopping experience for mainland resident visitors in Hong Kong and allow them greater flexibility when shopping, which is beneficial for Hong Kong in attracting more visitors and boosting the development of diversified tourism," he said.

 The SAR government has condemned Taiwan for issuing a travel alert for Hong Kong, saying the island had smeared the city and its national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said the issuing of an "orange" alert by the Taiwan authorities warning residents against travelling to the mainland, Hong Kong and Macau was a “political manoeuvre with fact-twisting smears and slanders exposing malicious intentions.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan had said the alert -- its second highest – was needed because the risk of travelling to Hong Kong had risen following the implementation of the National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the SAR government spokesman countered that safeguarding national security is a constitutional duty – just like it is in many common law jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Taiwan authorities turned a blind eye to the fact, made exaggerated remarks, maliciously smeared and demonised the NSL and the SNSO, completely unmasking its double standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that ordinary travellers – including those from Taiwan --  would not unwittingly violate the law, noting that national security offences target only an extremely small minority who endanger national security and the safety of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Shanghai-based professor of politics said on Friday that he believes authorities will adopt a gradual approach to any major structural economic reforms that are implemented, amid the nation's post-pandemic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials in Beijing said on Thursday that the Communist Party of China will convene the third plenary session of its 20th central committee on July 15, focusing on issues related to further comprehensively deepening reform and advancing Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Josef Gregory Mahoney from the East China Normal University said there's a need to tackle insufficient demand in the domestic economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, a major question that has dogged leaders is the extent to which they are ready to implement major structural reforms to the economy," Mahoney said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past week or so we've heard from the premier, for example at Davos, that those type of reforms aren't on the table presently, given the need to extend the recovery while facing some really big global uncertainties. Instead he's signalled a gradualist approach where the market plays a more decisive role."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mahoney added that the government faced time constraints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, it's also clear that there are a number of reforms that are needed now and so we've got this rubric that's being promoted - it's not a new one, but it's become the catchphrase of the third plenum - 'comprehensively advancing reforms'", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Politburo meeting on Thursday chaired by President Xi Jinping, who's also general secretary of party central committee, the plenum will last until July 18.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Communist Party of China on Thursday said it expelled two former defence ministers for "serious violation of party discipline and the law".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two are Wei Fenghe and his successor Li Shangfu, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Wei and Li formerly served as members of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and as state councillors, and were deprived of their qualifications as delegates to the 20th CPC National Congress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CMC's disciplinary and supervisory agency launched an investigation against Wei on September 21, 2023, and Li on August 31 of the same year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the results of the investigations, they were both found to have seriously violated political and organisational discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua reported Wei had "helped others gain improper benefits in personnel arrangements and also seriously violated discipline regarding integrity, accepting money and gifts in violation of relevant rules."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added: "As a high-ranking official of the party and the military, Wei lost his faith and loyalty. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the military, bringing enormous damage to the party's cause, the development of national defence and the armed forces as well as the image of senior officials."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And Li had "sought improper benefits in personnel arrangements for himself and others, took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and accepted a huge amount of money and valuables in return", Xinhua reported.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Li betrayed the party's original aspirations and its principles. His actions failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the CMC, and severely contaminated the political environment of the equipment sector in the military and the ethics of relevant industries," according to Xinhua.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A pair of giant pandas are on their way from China to the United States where they will be cared for at the San Diego Zoo as part of an ongoing conservation partnership between the two countries, officials said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, and Xin Bao, a 4-year-old female, departed from Ya'an City in Sichuan Province on Wednesday evening, embarking on a 10-year international giant panda protection cooperation in the US.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It marks a new round of giant panda protection cooperation between the two countries, following an agreement signed in February between the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the San Diego Zoo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance were on hand in Sichuan for the farewell ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This farewell celebrates their journey and underscores a collaboration between the United States and China on vital conservation efforts," Paul Baribault, the wildlife alliance president, said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our long-standing partnership with China Wildlife Conservation Association has been instrumental in advancing giant panda conservation, and we look forward to continuing our work together to ensure the survival and thriving of this iconic species.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan and Xin Bao will transit through Hong Kong and are scheduled to arrive in the US on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The giant pandas are accompanied by experienced breeders and veterinarians during the journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It could be several weeks before they will be viewable to the public in San Diego, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yun Chuan's mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai Yun and Gao Gao.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xin Bao is described as “a gentle and witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.” (Xinhua/AP)

    Shenzhen-Zhongshan link to open on Sunday

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A mega transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan is expected to cut the travel time between the two cities to 30 minutes. Image: CCTV" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1759256_1_20240627121736.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A major transport link connecting Shenzhen and Zhongshan will open on Sunday, state media reported.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It's expected to cut the travel time between the two Greater Bay Area cities to 30 minutes from the current two hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to CCTV, the link will open to traffic on 3pm on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 24-kilometre link includes two bridges, two artificial islands and a two-way eight-lane sea tunnel, and took seven years to complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It features the Lingdingyang Bridge, described as the world's largest offshore steel box girder suspension bridge, as well as a 6.8km sea tunnel, the world's largest and widest undersea steel shell concrete tube tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A cross-boundary bus service provider said it will increase the frequency of its service from Hong Kong to Zhongshan by about 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The general manager of Shum Kong Wing Lee Cross Border Bus, Freeman Cheung, said the company also plans to introduce an extra route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, said the agency he owns anticipates the number of tour groups visiting Zhongshan and Shunde will at least double over the summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the new road will enable travel agencies to come up with new itineraries, including one-day trips to the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A driver surnamed Wang told RTHK that she has been travelling between Shenzhen and Zhongshan via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau Bridge, but plans to switch to the new road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s more convenient and closer. I can probably save half an hour per trip. The toll is also lower,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a Shenzhen taxi driver said he thinks the new road won't be of any use to him.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he has never taken a passenger from Shenzhen to Zhongshan and this probably won't change just because the travel time is shorter.

 The return capsule of the Chang'e-6 lunar probe was opened at a ceremony in Beijing on Wednesday, a day after it returned to Earth bringing back the first samples ever collected from the far side of the moon.

  Researchers opened the capsule and examined key technical indicators during the ceremony at the China Academy of Space Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese lunar probe has returned to Earth with the first ever samples collected from the moon's far side.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chang'e-6 touched down in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region shortly after 2pm on Tuesday, completing its complex and challenging 53-day lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The returner of [the] Chang'e-6 mission has landed successfully at Siziwang Banner, at the designated area. I would like to announce that the Chang'e-6 lunar mission has achieved a complete success," said Zhang Kejian, the director of the China National Space Administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President Xi Jinping also extended his congratulations on the complete success of the lunar mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a congratulatory message carried by state media, Xi said the "outstanding contributions" of the mission command "will be remembered forever by the motherland and the people".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The re-entry capsule brought back lunar soil and rocks that it spent two days collecting by a drill and robotic arm from the side of the moon that faces away from Earth. It would be brought to Beijing for further studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chang'e-6 blasted off from a space centre in Hainan on May 3, and descended into the moon's immense South Pole-Aitken Basin almost exactly a month later.

 Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday said the Chinese economy had gotten off to a "good start" this year, and that the nation will continue to strive to create an open environment for technological innovations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li made the remarks at a keynote speech at the opening of a World Economic Forum meeting – also known as Summer Davos – in Dalian city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said: "The rapid growth of new industries and new drivers has buttressed the sound and sustained development of the Chinese economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the start of this year the Chinese economy has sustained the momentum of recovery. It got off to a good start in the first quarter of this year... and continued steady growth in the second quarter. We're confident and capable in achieving the growth target of around five percent for this year," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also proposed that there should be a deepening of exchanges and cooperation in science and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Science and technology are key variables in future development and major sci-tech progress usually comes from unrelenting research accumulation and extensive cooperation," Li said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier also told delegates that the nation's electric vehicles and lithium batteries were not only meeting domestic demand, but also enriching global supply amid trade tensions with the West.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping on Monday held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda, who is on a state visit to China, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the meeting Duda told Xi that relations between Poland and China remained strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Russia-Ukraine conflict was on the agenda for talks, but no remarks on the issue were delivered before journalists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Over the past 75 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bilateral relations have maintained steady development, constantly injecting new vitality into the traditional friendship between the two countries,” Xi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two sides announced during the meeting that China would implement a 15-day unilateral visa-free policy for Polish citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several trade agreements were signed following the meeting between the two leaders, including on Polish agricultural exports and educational exchanges.
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market, senior officials of both sides said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said he had been informed by EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis that there would be concrete negotiations on tariffs with China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The confirmation came after the Commerce Ministry said Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Dombrovskis, executive vice president of the European Commission, had agreed to start consultations over the EU's anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to consider both parties' reasonable concerns to avoid the escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner, Wang said during a meeting with Habeck who is on a visit to China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister added that China hopes that Germany will play a positive role in the EU, prompting the European side to meet China halfway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is new and surprising in that it has not been possible to enter into a concrete negotiation timetable in the last few weeks," Habeck said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it was a first step and many more will be necessary. "We are far from the end, but at least, it is a first step that was not possible before."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Habeck had said earlier on Saturday that the European Union's door was open for discussions regarding EU tariffs on Chinese exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The European Commission has announced provisional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese EVs by July 4, with the investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could be imposed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has spoken out against the move, describing the higher duties as protectionist. (Reuters/Xinhua)

    China, France launch satellite to study universe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Long March 2-C rocket carrying a satellite jointly developed by China and France dubbed the Space Variable Objects Monitor, lifts off from a space base in Xichang, in China’s southwestern Sichuan province.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China has launched a satellite in cooperation with France to catch gamma-ray bursts in the universe's outermost regions, in a notable example of cooperation between a Western power and the Asian giant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Developed by engineers from both countries, the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is carrying four instruments -- two French, two Chinese -- that will seek out gamma-ray bursts, the light from which has travelled billions of light years to reach Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 930-kilogram (2,050-pound) satellite "successfully" took off around 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) aboard a Chinese Long March 2-C rocket from a space base in Xichang, in southwestern Sichuan province, China's National Space Administration said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gamma-ray bursts generally occur after the explosion of huge stars -- those more than 20 times as big as the sun -- or the fusion of compact stars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The extremely bright cosmic beams can give off a blast of energy equivalent to more than a billion billion suns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Observing them is like "looking back in time, as the light from these objects takes a long time to reach us", Ore Gottlieb, an astrophysicist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Astrophysics in New York, told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rays carry traces of the gas clouds and galaxies they pass through on their journey through space -- valuable data for better understanding the history and evolution of the universe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVOM has the potential to unravel several mysteries in the field of (gamma-ray bursts), including detecting the most distant GRBs in the universe, which correspond to the earliest GRBs," Gottlieb said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The most distant bursts identified to date were produced just 630 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was in its infancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are... interested in gamma-ray bursts for their own sake because they are very extreme cosmic explosions which allow us to better understand the death of certain stars," said Frederic Daigne, an astrophysicist at the Paris Institute of Astrophysics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of this data makes it possible to test the laws of physics with phenomena that are impossible to reproduce in the laboratory on Earth."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Once analysed, the data could help to improve understanding of the composition of space, and the dynamics of gas clouds or other galaxies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project stems from a partnership between the French and Chinese space agencies as well as other scientific and technical groups from both nations. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said Friday that the European Union was to blame for escalating trade frictions with China, which could lead to a "trade war".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Responsibility lies entirely with the EU side," a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China hoped the EU would meet it halfway, handle differences through dialogue and avoid escalating trade friction or allowing it to get out of control, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the European Commission proposed tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicle imports from China despite Beijing's protest, plunging trade ties to a new low and risking punitive action from the world's second-largest economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry statement was published just before the arrival of German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Beijing, where he was expected to explain to Chinese officials the recent tariff announcement while allaying the risk of retaliation that could harm German businesses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Days of torrential rain, flash floods and landslides across southern China have forced authorities to enact emergency plans, as swollen rivers threaten to overflow further, potentially disrupting the lives of millions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, Guangdong upgraded an emergency response plan for disasters like landslides and flooding to the second-highest level, helping to coordinate and deploy resources across the province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several other provinces have already activated a Level-IV emergency response for flood control as this year's flooding season kicked into high gear.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Heavy rain and landslides in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have already killed at least nine people and left several people missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi in southwest China, raised a "red" flood warning signal, the highest level, late on Wednesday when the water level of the Li River, which runs through the city, reached 3.61 metres above the warning line, China Daily reported on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The water level at the river's hydrological station in Rongjiang township hit a record high, threatening residents' lives and properties along the river, the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Guilin authorities urged departments, townships and scenic spots to help prevent and combat possible flooding in the coming days as water levels at major rivers continue to rise, according to state media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moderate to heavy rain is expected to start again from Friday through Monday in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the longest waterway in Asia, according to China's Central Meteorological Observatory. (Reuters)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday announced it had opened a new regional centre in Shanghai to further strengthen its engagement and partnership in the Asia-Pacific region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The opening was announced on the first day of the two-day annual Lujiazui financial forum in the mainland’s financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the IMF said the new centre “will serve as a hub to promote research that can inform policies in areas of interest to emerging market and middle-income countries”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will help deepen the IMF’s dialogue with member countries and other stakeholders in the region, including international financial institutions, academics, think-tanks, CSOs, and the private sector,” the statement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, it said the new establishment would facilitate targeted capacity-building in the region, including via peer-to-peer learning, in collaboration with the China IMF Capacity Development Centre (CICDC).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also expressed gratitude to China’s central bank for its generous financial support to its Shanghai Regional Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre’s launch ceremony, Pan Gongsheng, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, said he welcomed the new establishment in Shanghai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe the Shanghai Regional Centre will deepen cooperation between the IMF and China, enhance macroeconomic policy exchange and coordination among the Asia Pacific countries, and support regional and global financial stability,” Pan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Pan, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said at the same event that the Shanghai centre “will deepen understanding of perspectives from member countries, and foster international economic cooperation”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The opening of the new centre came after the IMF earlier upgraded its estimate for China’s economic growth for this year from 4.6 percent to five percent last month, putting its projections in line with Beijing’s full-year growth estimate at around five percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and Malaysia signed a slew of deals on Wednesday, renewing a five-year economic co-operation pact and allowing exports of fresh durians, during a visit by Premier Li Qiang to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is ready to work with Malaysia," Li said in a statement, adding that focus areas included development strategies, mutually beneficial co-operation and exchanges to promote the building of a China-Malaysia community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts on co-operation in areas ranging from the digital economy to green development, housing, tourism and communications, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new five-year pact that runs until 2028 provides for strategic collaboration in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-year programme was first introduced in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two countries also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has been Malaysia’s largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at US$98.9 billion in 2023.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China’s investment in critical minerals, clean energy and business links topped the agenda of Premier Li Qiang's visit to the Australian city of Perth on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li said China's economy has continued to rebound and improve, with its new growth drivers gaining momentum, against the backdrop of sluggish global growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the final leg of his trip to Australia, the premier said China was planning major measures for further comprehensively deepening reform and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, and the country's business environment will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his trip to Perth, Li inspected iron ore miner Fortescue’s clean energy research facility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fortescue’s chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company’s plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially “green iron”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think China chose us because it’s not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it’s the best technology to go green in the world and we’ve got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,” Forrest told The Associated Press before the visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we’re a great mining country, so by all means let’s go in harder after critical minerals, but let’s not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,” Forrest said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also visited Chinese-controlled Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia’s processing plant south of Perth to underscore China’s interest in investing in critical minerals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese flew to Perth from the national capital Canberra where the two leaders on Monday held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both attended a round table of business leaders in Perth representing resource companies including mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Business Council of Australia chief executive Bran Black said business dialogue was essential to the bilateral relations between the two trading partners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While there have been challenging times in the bilateral relationship between the two nations, I think it’s fair to say this is another positive point of progress,” Black told the meeting. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 President Xi Jinping has urged all-out efforts to fight floods and droughts and ensure solid work in disaster relief to safeguard people's lives and property as well as social stability.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At least nine people have been killed in southern China from heavy rains that triggered landslides, knocked out power for entire villages and buried crops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides triggered by severe flooding killed at least five people in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifteen others were missing, according to local media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four people were killed and two others were missing in Wuping county in Fujian province due to landslides caused by torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Severe downpours started on Sunday afternoon, with authorities measuring 372.4 millimetres of rainfall over a 24-hour period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the southwestern Guizhou province, more than 1,100 people were evacuated due to flooding in several counties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, northern parts of the country are battling drought, as the country faces two extremes of severe weather. (Xinhua/AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday hit back at a G7 end-of-summit statement that took aim at China, accusing it of being "full of arrogance, prejudice and lies".
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The G7 summit statement once again manipulated China-related issues, slandered and attacked China, rehashed cliches that have no factual basis, no legal basis, and no moral justification, and are full of arrogance, prejudice and lies," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When Group of Seven leaders met last week in Italy, souring trade relations with Beijing as well as tensions over Ukraine and the South China Sea were a focus of their discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement released at the end of the summit said China was sending dual-use materials to Russia which were helping Moscow's war in Ukraine. (Xinhua/AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China on Monday said it had launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of pork and pork by-products from the European Union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The Ministry of Commerce has opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of relevant pork and pig by-products originating from the European Union," the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The investigation would begin on June 17, the ministry said, and was prompted by a complaint submitted by the China Animal Husbandry Association on June 6.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce ministry said the investigation should be completed by June 17, 2025, but could be extended by another six months if required.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following the European Commission's June 12 announcement that it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from July, global food companies have been on high alert for retaliatory tariffs from China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities on the mainland had previously dropped hints about possible retaliatory measures through state media commentaries and interviews with industry figures. (Agencies)

    China-Australia ties on the right track: Li Qiang

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Premier Li Qiang, right, shakes hands with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at Parliament House in Canberra. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757760_1_20240617121312.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's relationship with Australia is on the right track, Premier Li Qiang said in Canberra on Monday as the two trading partners moved on from their economic dispute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The highest-ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017, Li held high-level talks with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese following a welcome ceremony at Parliament House.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In less than one year Prime Minister Albanese and I have met multiple times and exchanged visits to each other's country," Li said following their meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This shows that our countries attach great importance to our relationship and that this relationship is on the right track of steady improvement and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said he and Albanese had a "candid exchange of views on some differences and disagreements", and the two countries have agreed to properly manage those differences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier added the further development of bilateral ties requires joint efforts from both sides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening remarks, Albanese said China and Australia had complementary economies and shared interests in addressing climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have our differences... that's why candid dialogue is so important. For Australia, we consistently advocate the importance of a region and world that is peaceful, stable and prosperous, where countries respect sovereignty and abide by international laws," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Australia advocates that we should all work together to promote a regional balance where no country dominates and no country is dominated.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting in 2020, a slew of Australia's most lucrative export commodities were effectively banned from China as diplomatic relations rapidly unravelled. But as ties have gradually improved under a new government in Canberra, Beijing has wound back most of these trade barriers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China remains overwhelmingly Australia's largest trading partner. Australian farmers, miners and exporters are already seeing the benefits of the removal of trade impediments – benefits that flow to our economy," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also described the discussions with Li as constructive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Premier Li also said the two countries would expand cooperation in energy and mining, and China would include Australia in its visa waiver programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the two sides will take steps to improve military communication to avoid incidents. "One of the very practical measures that we spoke about was improving military-to-military communication so as to avoid incidents," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an incident last month, a Chinese air force jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter in international airspace over the Yellow Sea. Canberra called it a dangerous encounter whereas the Foreign Ministry in Beijing accused the Australian military of provocative and threatening behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li visited New Zealand before Australia and is scheduled to stop in Malaysia on Tuesday before returning to China. (Agencies)

    China retail sales strong in May, but output lags

    <![CDATA[<img alt="New data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows improving consumer sentiment, although industrial output lagged expectations. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757755_1_20240617113531.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's retail sales figures in May, a major indicator of consumption sentiment, rose 3.7 percent year on year to 3.92 trillion yuan, accelerating from a 2.3 percent increase in April and marking the quickest rate of growth since February.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Newly released data on Monday from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) also showed that retail sales climbed 4.1 percent year on year in the first five months of 2024, to hit 19.52 trillion yuan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts had expected retail sales to grow three percent due to the five-day public holiday earlier in the month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, industrial output on the mainland lagged expectations with the property sector still weak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Industrial data released by the NBS came in below expectations for a six percent increase, with output rising only 5.6 percent year on year in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fixed asset investment expanded four percent in the first five months of 2024 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 4.2 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It grew 4.2 percent in the January to April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NBS also reported that China's raw coal output fell three percent year on year to 1.86 billion tonnes in the first five months of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In May alone, the country's raw coal output stood at 380 million tonnes, down 0.8 percent year on year, although the decline was 2.1 percentage points narrower than in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, China's property market downturn, high local government debt and deflation remained heavy drags on economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The latest figures point to an uneven growth pattern that reinforced calls for more fiscal and monetary policy support from the central government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With narrowing interest margins and a weakening currency remaining key constraints limiting Beijing's scope to ease monetary policy, China's central bank left a key policy rate unchanged as expected on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world's second-largest economy grew faster than expected at 5.3 percent in the first quarter, but analysts said the government's around five percent annual growth target was ambitious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's exports grew faster than expected in May helped by improved global demand, but growth in imports slowed significantly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tepid demand at home has also kept a lid on consumer prices as confidence remains low in the face of a protracted property sector crisis while new bank lending rebounded less than expected in May. (Xinhua/Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Eight people have died of suffocation in a refrigerated truck in Henan province, a local investigation team said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were found unconscious when the vehicle arrived at a petrol station on Saturday evening in Hongzhuangyang Township in Yexian County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victims were confirmed dead in the small hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to Xinhua News Agency, the eight had stayed in the insulated compartment of the vehicle, which was against regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was not immediately clear if they were Chinese nationals or foreigners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The truck driver and other "responsible personnel" have been detained, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the case was being investigated. (Xinhua/AFP)

 Premier Li Qiang called on Saturday for "shelving differences" with Australia as he launched a visit centred on the promise of economic opportunities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li offered the olive branch after landing in Adelaide for a four-day diplomatic trip, which comes after China lifted trade sanctions against a string of major Australian exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History has proven that mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences and mutually beneficial cooperation are the valuable experience in growing China-Australia relations, and must be carried forward," he said in a written arrival statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A more mature, stable and fruitful comprehensive strategic partnership will be a treasure shared by the people of both countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li touched down in Adelaide at the start of his diplomatic mission across the resource-rich continent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is the highest ranking Chinese official to visit Australia since 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China has gradually removed trade sanctions on wine, timber, barley and beef exports imposed in 2020 during a diplomatic rift with a former conservative government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The measures cost Australian exporters an estimated Aus$20 billion (US$13 billion) a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Economic relations between the two countries have eased since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government took power in 2022 and adopted a softer diplomatic approach to Beijing. (AFP)

    Rebound in Chinese lending less than expected in May

<div class="itemFullText">
 New bank lending in China rebounded far less than expected in May, and some key money gauges hit record lows, suggesting the world's second-largest economy continued to face headwinds even as the central bank seeks to bolster confidence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chinese banks issued 950 billion yuan in new loans last month, compared to 730 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters' calculations based on the latest data from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) released on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted loans would rise to 1.255 trillion yuan but would still be below the 1.36 trillion yuan issued in May last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China’s credit extension came in lower than expected in May, suggesting that the deleveraging in the households continues," said Zhou Hao, chief economist at Guotai Junan International.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhou said China's central bank may be reluctant to cut interest rates any time soon, as that could lead to further depreciation of the yuan as the US Federal Reserve seems in no hurry to start cutting its rates, which is buoying the dollar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Balancing all the factors, we think that the PBOC would refrain from policy rate cuts for now but provide more targeted support via relending programmes over the foreseeable future," he said. (Reuters)

    CE confident in GBA opportunities

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

 Premier Li Qiang said on Friday that Beijing is willing to make efforts to upgrade the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Addressing a welcome banquet in Auckland held by various social communities on day two of his visit to New Zealand, Li also said the momentum of China's economic recovery has continued to strengthen and consolidate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier said the upgrading of China's economic structure will bring new opportunities for global development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will always be open to enterprises from New Zealand and other countries, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The premier earlier visited the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, a government agency tasked with promoting the country's farming, food and beverage industries, before meetings and a dinner with business people, academics and diplomats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mark Piper, the chief executive of a top New Zealand government science institute, was among those meeting Li.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was talking about more research collaborations and more people exchanges, which is what we're really interested in," he told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He was really big on collaboration, the value that New Zealand can bring to China and that China can bring to New Zealand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li is due to travel to Australia on Saturday. He'll also visit Malaysia as part of his three-nation trip. (Xinhua & agencies)

    China firms apply for EU pork import probe: report

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757395_1_20240614110707.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese firms have formally applied for an anti-dumping investigation into pork imports from the European Union, the Global Times newspaper said, after the bloc's decision to impose anti-subsidy duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China imported US$6 billion worth of pork in 2023, including offal, with the EU accounting for more than half, customs data showed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Global Times report gave no details of the anti-dumping probe, and it was unclear which pork products would be targeted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pig parts that are not favoured in Europe such as feet, ears and offal are popular among Chinese consumers, providing a valuable and important market for Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Spain was China's top supplier last year, followed by Brazil and the United States. Other major suppliers are France, Denmark and the Netherlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China had said it would take "all necessary measures" to safeguard its interests in the wake of the EU decision to slap tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on electric vehicles made in China, which is due to take effect from July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EV tariffs drew a strong rebuke from China as well as European and Chinese car makers, with industry insiders saying both Europe and China have reasons to strike a deal in the months ahead, as the EU process allows for review. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 China and New Zealand on Thursday signed agreements on trade and climate change during Premier Li Qiang's visit to the country, the highest level Chinese visit in seven years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Li also expressed the hope that New Zealand can support Hong Kong in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership when he met Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on the first day of his trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the talks, the Premier was greeted on the lawns of Government House in the capital Wellington by Luxon and participated in a traditional indigenous Maori welcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the meeting, Li said that the two agreed that it is important to expand cooperation on trade and investment and that China is ready to be part of New Zealand's efforts to double its value of exports in the next decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Premier said Beijing will also extend visa-free travel to New Zealanders, while New Zealand will support Chinese language teaching and cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We agreed that it is important to promote the sustained sound and steady development of China and New Zealand relations," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to view and handle bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective to lay a solid political foundation of our cooperation in all fields.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said he expressed the hope that New Zealand could support the SAR in joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest free trade agreement. Hong Kong officially requested to join RCEP in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luxon for his part said they discussed the two country's significant economic relationship, with two-way trade in goods worth nearly 22.4 billion US dollars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China and New Zealand have different political systems and as with all of our long standing relationships, it is natural that we will raise our differences with China consistently and predictably," Luxon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li will later visit Australia this weekend and then travel to Malaysia.

    Stop turning trade into a political issue: Mofa

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A Xinhua commentary says the EU should embrace competition as an impetus for its own development. File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757238_1_20240613112719.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry has urged the European Commission to stop turning trade into a political issue and avoid harming mutual trust between China and the European Union, as shares in Chinese automakers ended on a mostly positive note on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment from the Foreign Ministry came as the European Commission announced it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported electric cars from China starting in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China will take all necessary measures to counter these actions, spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xinhua news agency had earlier said the move by the EU violates the rights and interests of the nation's EV industry and wreaks havoc on the global automotive supply chain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a commentary published late on Wednesday, Xinhua said "the EU's justification for these tariffs are based on claims of unfair competition due to so-called 'distortive' Chinese government subsidies. However, this claim is nothing but a thinly veiled excuse for protectionism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after Washington announced plans to quadruple duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would combat excessive subsidies with additional tariffs ranging from 17.4 percent for BYD to 38.1 percent for SAIC, on top of the standard 10 percent car duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move comes as European automakers are being challenged by an influx of lower-cost EVs from Chinese rivals. Still, there's virtually no support for tariffs from the European auto industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  German automakers in particular are heavily dependent on sales in China and fear retribution from Beijing. European auto firms also import their own Chinese-made vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xinhua commentary continued by saying the EU should instead "embrace this competition as an impetus for its own development".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that rather than imposing tariffs, the EU should seek collaborative solutions that benefit all parties involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, shares in BYD shot up more than five percent on Thursday on the Hang Seng Index, where carmakers NIO and Geely also ended the day 1.3 percent and 1.6 percent higher. SAIC was down more than 1.5 percent in Shanghai. (Additional reporting by Reuters)

    Beijing rebukes additional EU tariffs on Chinese EVs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="China vowed to protect its interests if the EU goes ahead with its tariffs on Chinese EVs. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757113_1_20240612162215.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Wednesday criticised additional European Union tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), saying the move violated market economy principles and international trade rules.
 <br>
  <br/>
  MOFA spokesperson Lin Jian said any additional tariffs on Chinese EVs would eventually undermine the EU's own interests, adding Beijing would take all necessary measures to protect its lawful rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin's comments came ahead of an announcement by the European Commission that it would apply additional duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric vehicles from next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Less than a month after the United States quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent, Brussels said it would set tariffs of 17.4 percent for BYD, 20 percent for Geely and 38.1 percent for SAIC over what it said were excessive subsidies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU provisional duties are set to apply by July 4, with an anti-subsidy investigation set to continue until November 2, when definitive duties, typically for five years, could apply.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission vice president, told a news conference that Chinese-built cars were benefiting from unfair levels of subsidies, threatening EU producers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On this basis the Commission has reached out to Chinese authorities to discuss these findings and explore possible ways for resolving the issues identified," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commerce Ministry also said China is strongly dissatisfied with the European plan to impose provisional duties on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, saying the move ignored facts and World Trade Organisation rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ministry said Beijing will resolutely take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese companies. (Reuters/Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's consumer inflation held steady in May while producer price declines eased, but the underlying trend suggests Beijing would need to do more to prop up weakened domestic demand and an uneven economic recovery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in May from a year earlier, matching a gain in April, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday, below a 0.4 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slide in the producer price index eased to 1.4 percent in May from 2.5 percent in April, compared with a forecast 1.5 percent decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's economy has struggled to gain traction despite the end of stringent pandemic curbs in late 2022, mainly due to the ripple effects of a prolonged property sector crisis on investor, business and consumer confidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Beijing has rolled out several measures to spur demand in the housing sector and launched other schemes to boost consumer sentiment, including offering government-subsidised incentives to spur trade-ins of cars and other consumer goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has also vowed to create more jobs linked to major projects, roll out measures to promote domestic demand targeted for youths and has pledged greater fiscal stimulus to shore up growth. (Reuters)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Premier Li Qiang will kick off an overseas visit this week that takes him to New Zealand, Australia and Malaysia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that the trip will take place from June 13 to 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li’s visit to Australia will extend from Saturday to Tuesday and will be the first by a Chinese premier to the country since 2017, in a further indication that strained bilateral relations are improving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trip comes after China lifted most of the trade barriers it had imposed on Australian exports, including coal, timber, barley and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will hold an annual leaders’ meeting in Canberra during the visit. The premier is expected to visit Adelaide and Perth as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia is an important opportunity to engage directly on key issues for both our nations," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "China is Australia's largest trading partner and our economic relationship continues to bring substantial benefits to both our countries."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albanese will also raise the case of writer Yang Hengjun who was given a suspended death sentence in China on espionage charges in February, as well as an incident last month where a Chinese military jet dropped flares near an Australian defence helicopter, which the Australian leader said "was dangerous and should never had happened".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Welcoming the Chinese premier to our shores is an opportunity for Australia to advance our interests by demonstrating our national values, our people's qualities and our economy's strengths," Albanese said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Australia continues to pursue a stable and direct relationship with China, with dialogue at its core."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Monday that Li would visit the country this week, adding that the trip would be a valuable opportunity for exchanges on areas of bilateral cooperation. (Agencies)

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources told RTHK that Lai Ka-ying, a police chief inspector, has been selected as the city's first-ever payload specialist in the National Manned Space Programme.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the successful selection of a Hong Kong astronaut in the national space programme marked a “glorious chapter” in the city’s history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after state broadcaster CCTV, quoting the China Manned Space Agency, reported that the 10 people were selected as the fourth batch of national preparatory astronauts, among whom eight were space pilots, and two were payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he felt very excited and encouraged by the selection of a Hong Kong candidate, as he thanked the central government for providing the opportunity for Hongkongers to participate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle that the SAR is eligible for selection in the national space programme, as the programme is a national task.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, [the selection] indicates that the nation attaches great importance to the SAR's technological and innovation development. The SAR government will continue to promote measures to nurture more innovation and technology talent and support the city in becoming an international tech and innovation hub,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Lee, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, also expressed his congratulations, as he pledged the SAR government would do everything possible to assist the candidate successfully complete their training on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know the public is looking forward to knowing about who is selected, but as we know there are many considerations from the nation when selecting preparatory astronauts, and in its usual practice, the nation will only publish the number of the candidates for the time being, and will not reveal the identities of the candidates.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR government will continue to maintain communications with mainland authorities, and publish details in due course,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology chief also noted the candidate was among 120 people who were originally signed up for the recruitment drive in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition to the basic physical and educational requirements, there’s also quite diverse professional requirements in areas including natural science, engineering, biomedics,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While both Lee and Sun did not disclose the Hong Kong astronaut’s identity and other details, sources told RTHK the person selected was Lai Ka-ying, a chief inspector with the Hong Kong Police Force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has a doctoral degree and has three children. She will travel to the mainland for subsequent training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The recruitment of astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau was launched in October 2022, marking the first time the nation’s space programme considered selecting astronauts from the two SARs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three selection rounds have been held since the recruitment drive was launched, and Lee noted the recruitment process was very strict.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four American educators from a small university in the state of Iowa were reportedly stabbed in a public park in Jilin province over the weekend, according to US media and US government officials.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The educators from Cornell College were visiting a partner university in the northeastern province when the attack occurred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a Cornell College spokesperson, the stabbing occurred in Jilin City and the partner school was Beihua University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds wrote on the social media platform X that she was in touch with the US State Department about the attack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing and was monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Tuesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the incident was a random attack and would "not affect normal people-to-people exchanges between China and the United States". (Reuters)

    China team gears up for Paris Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China's sports officials say the national team's performance during the coming Olympics will be "worth looking forward to," although they are faced with more challenges than previous games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The General Administration of Sport of China said it expects athletes to compete in around 210 out of the 329 events at the Paris Olympics next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the national team would take part in all events in diving, weightlifting, shooting, gymnastics, table tennis and badminton – sports that the country is traditionally strong at.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Lingfeng, who heads the training division of the competitive sports department of the body, said the team was making its final preparations for Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the time difference and other factors would not be favourable for the national team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are perfectly aware that the difficulties and challenges at the Paris Olympics are far greater than those before," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The level of our athletic skills in some gold-winning events has dropped as we're transitioning from one generation of athletes to another."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang noted the United States, which has topped the gold medal table at world tournaments in the past, continues to be one of the main competitors, while other countries are also improving quickly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the official said the national team has what it takes to achieve "outstanding results" in the French capital after preparing for the games for more than two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they have also been working to instil patriotism into athletes and coaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been educating the national team... to further solidify their confidence and determination to attain good results at the Paris Olympics and bring glory to the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said doing well at the Olympics is important to turn China into a country that excels at sports.

    NSL demonstrates HK's constitutional duty: Zheng

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong to curb disorder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Zheng Yanxiong said a dual legislation and dual enforcement mechanism between the SAR and the mainland was established after the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It demonstrates the SAR's constitutional duty. It shows that Hong Kong's mechanisms for safeguarding national security and enforcement have improved, while addressing previous shortcomings - and ensuring that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle is on the right track," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that 45 out of 47 defendants were convicted in a subversion case after they were involved in an unofficial legislative primary election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different sectors generally affirmed the ruling, believed that it disseminated correct messages on the rule of law, showed the determination and confidence of the society in safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the National Security Law had been effective in improving governance and creating prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past four years, Hong Kong has made a significant transformation from chaos to governance, returning to the track of development. In March, Hong Kong completed legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, further solidifying the legal shield for safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong National Security Law explicitly identifies its purpose as maintaining the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR, highlighting this original aspiration to protect development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government Dong Jingwei said the central government has full trust in the SAR government, authorising it to have the responsibility for safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the central government would deal with any problems that the SAR government finds difficult to handle.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756593_2_20240608080909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the Olympic Games less than two months away, dedicated Hong Kong-trained specialists are working tirelessly to ensure the country's elite athletes stay injury-free and perform at their very best in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For trainer Ivy Lui, a career highlight came when Liu Yang, one of the Chinese gymnasts she worked with, secured the gold medal on rings at last year’s World Championships in Antwerp.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I felt like my dreams from graduation have come true,” she said. “I knew I wanted to help an athlete achieve an honour at the international stage.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gymnast also won gold in rings at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so he'll be defending his title in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui's journey as a sports therapist began eight years ago when she graduated from the Technological and Higher Education Institute of Hong Kong, a member institution of the Vocational Training Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After spending time with the Hong Kong Rugby Union, she began working with the gymnastics team in Guangzhou before joining the national gymnastics team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her days involve giving massages to the gymnasts, to help them relax after training sessions, and treating any injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But her work goes beyond physical therapy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To ensure comprehensive preparation, we also recreate a live atmosphere and simulate actual playing time during our gym training sessions in China before going overseas,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another dedicated professional Davii Wang, a rugby technician, holds a master's degree in sports science and physical education from the Chinese University.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang was already working with the national rugby team before he went on to pursue an advanced degree in Hong Kong, so he would have a deeper understanding of the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The one-year study made my work more systematic,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, we use force platforms to test athletes, which can indicate whether there’s discrepancy in their leg strength.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there is a big discrepancy, we will strengthen the weaker leg to prevent injuries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of Wang's key tasks is to make sure China's men and women rugby teams stay in top form, as they try to book a ticket to Paris through a qualification tournament later this month.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Russia next week for a gathering of counterparts from the Brics group of emerging economies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang will meet with other foreign ministers for talks "on issues of common concern such as Brics cooperation and current and regional situations", Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mao said that Brics is an important platform for cooperation between emerging markets and developing countries and that members "have always been committed to safeguarding multilateralism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The meeting takes place on Monday and Tuesday in western Russia's Nizhny Novgorod.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China is willing to work "to consolidate the Brics strategic relations, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, (and) promote shared development and joint self-reliance in the global South", Mao said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bloc, its name derived from the initials of founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, announced last year a major expansion in membership, described at the time by President Xi Jinping as "historic". (AFP)

    China's May exports pick up pace

<div class="itemFullText">
 China's exports grew more quickly and for a second month in May, suggesting factory owners are managing to find buyers overseas and providing some relief to the economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outbound shipments from the world's second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent year-on-year last month, customs data showed on Friday, beating a forecast 6 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists and a 1.5 percent rise seen in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Imports increased 1.8 percent in May, slowing from an 8.4 percent jump in the previous month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over recent months, a flurry of data has shown different parts of the US$18.6 trillion economy recovering at varying speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While first quarter growth blew past forecasts and strong March export and output data suggested improving global demand might aid officials' efforts to get the economy back on a more even keel, recent indicators have reflected domestic consumption had softened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A protracted property sector crisis remains the biggest drag on China's economy, with low investor and consumer confidence hurting domestic consumption and undermining business activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Friday's trade data should give authorities some breathing space as they continue their efforts to foster a broad-based economic recovery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The International Monetary Fund last month upgraded its China growth forecast for 2024 in line with Beijing's growth target of "around" five percent, but warned of risks to the economy from the property troubles. (Reuters)
