Drivers are urged to steer clear of certain roads in Central and Wan Chai because of an upcoming triathlon test event.
<br>
<br/>
A total of around 110 athletes from Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland will compete in the men's individual, women's individual and mixed relay events at the Central Harbourfront and Victoria Harbour this weekend, as a part of a test event for the National Games in November.
<br/>
<br/>
The women's and men's individual races are set for 8am and 10:30am on Saturday respectively, while the mixed relay is scheduled for 2pm on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
Officials said from 10am on Wednesday to 6pm on Sunday, the section of Expo Drive between Legislative Council Road and Expo Drive Central will be temporarily closed.
<br/>
<br/>
Intermittent road closures will be implemented in the Central Harbourfront and Wan Chai North areas from 5am to 8am on Friday, affecting roads such as Lung Wo Road, Yiu Sing Street and Expo Drive.
<br/>
<br/>
Further road closures will take place from 2am to 2pm on Saturday and from 8am to 6pm on Sunday in the same areas.
<br/>
<br/>
Athletes will begin with a swim, followed by cycling before finishing with a run.
<br/>
<br/>
All races will start at the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade. The cycling route will pass Golden Bauhinia Square, while the running course will loop around the Central Harbourfront Promenade, finishing at the Central Harbourfront Event Space.

<div class="itemFullText">
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Monday said a new index it has introduced to gauge how well the city fares in environmental, social and governance (ESG) has identified several strengths.
<br>
<br/>
The council said it used the index in a survey of more than 1,200 vendors and buyers during several of its trade fairs and business events last year.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Hong Kong received a total of 64.3 points on the index, a figure well above the neutral point of 50.
<br/>
<br/>
Irina Fan, HKTDC's director of research, said the findings suggest Hong Kong excels in areas such as availability and diversity in green and sustainable products or services, talent training and market connection with international trade partners.
<br/>
<br/>
Fan said the survey showed that ESG considerations are increasingly regarded as integral elements in business decision-making processes.
<br/>
<br/>
Buyers also indicated a willingness to pay a premium of at least 10% for ESG products, while vendors reported additional profit margins from engaging with ESG businesses, Fan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
President Xi Jinping on Monday held a phone conversation with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis.
<br>
<br/>
Xinhua News Agency quoted the president as saying "China is happy to see Russia and relevant parties make positive efforts to defuse the Ukraine crisis".
<br/>
<br/>
Xi also said China and Russia are good neighbours and true friends supporting each other and achieving common development.
<br/>
<br/>
The president said their relationship does not target any third party, nor would it be influenced by any third party.
<br/>
<br/>
The Kremlin said in a statement that Xi expressed his support for dialogue between the US and Russia.
<br/>
<br/>
US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia last week and agreed to start work on restoring bilateral ties and preparing for Ukraine peace talks.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, a dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine's capital on Monday to mark the third anniversary of Russia’s military campaign.
<br/>
<br/>
The visitors, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, were set to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Kyiv with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Three improvised explosive devices were thrown at the Russian consulate in the southern French port city of Marseille on Monday but no one was injured, a police source said.
<br>
<br/>
Only two of the devices detonated in the attack on the third anniversary of Russia's campaign in Ukraine, the source said.
<br/>
<br/>
The consulate was sealed off by police and AFP journalists heard a detonation caused by a bomb disposal robot.
<br/>
<br/>
The Russian foreign ministry denounced what it called a "terrorist attack".
<br/>
<br/>
"The explosions on the territory of the Russian consulate general in Marseille have all the signs of a terrorist attack," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Russian reporters.
<br/>
<br/>
"We demand that the host country undertake exhaustive and speedy investigative measures, as well as steps to strengthen the security of Russia's foreign missions," said Zakharova.
<br/>
<br/>
Paris condemned the incident. "France condemns any infringement of the security of diplomatic compounds," a foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters.
<br/>
<br/>
"The inviolability, protection and integrity of diplomatic and consular compounds and their staff are fundamental principles in international law," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
Mainland lawmakers on Monday began deliberations on the draft private economy promotion law, which adds new provisions prohibiting arbitrary fees and fines on private enterprises.
<br>
<br/>
The draft law was submitted on Monday to an ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for a second reading. The first reading took place last December.
<br/>
<br/>
The draft bans the forced collection of funds or material donations from private enterprises and specifies that multiple inspection items of the same inspection target should be consolidated whenever possible or included within the scope of cross-departmental joint inspections.
<br/>
<br/>
It also includes provisions requiring the State Council and local people's governments at or above the county level to regularly report to the standing committees of the people's congresses of their corresponding level on the promotion of the private economy.
<br/>
<br/>
It stipulates that relevant industry associations and chambers of commerce should fulfill their coordinating and self-regulatory roles in accordance with laws, regulations, and their charters. (Xinhua)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Rachin Ravindra struck a superb 112 to lead New Zealand into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with a five-wicket win over Bangladesh, as hosts Pakistan were sent crashing out of the tournament.
<br>
<br/>
The result in Rawalpindi also ensured India's semi-final berth in the 50-over tournament as Bangladesh became the other team from Group A to be knocked out.
<br/>
<br/>
Both New Zealand and India have two wins from two matches and will now meet in Dubai on Sunday to decide team one and two from the group.
<br/>
<br/>
"Feels nice to qualify," New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner said after the win. "Knew Bangladesh would be a challenge."
<br/>
<br/>
Pakistan, who won the previous edition of the Champions Trophy in 2017, lost to New Zealand and then India in the first International Cricket Council (ICC) event they are hosting since the 1996 ODI World Cup.
<br/>
<br/>
India refused to tour Pakistan due to political reasons and instead are playing all their matches in Dubai, which will host the final if the Asian giants go the distance.
<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand have been the team to beat in this group after they humbled Pakistan by 60 runs in the tournament opener.
<br/>
<br/>
Coming in as firm favourites in their second match, New Zealand elected to field first and spinner Michael Bracewell returned career-best ODI figures of 4-36 to restrict Bangladesh to 236-9.
<br/>
<br/>
Chasing 237 for victory, New Zealand slipped to 15-2 and 72-3 before Ravindra and fellow left-hander Tom Latham, who made 55, added 129 for the fourth wicket.
<br/>
<br/>
Both were dismissed before the end but New Zealand still achieved the target with 23 balls to spare.
<br/>
<br/>
The Black Caps had a disastrous start when pace bowler Tasking Ahmed bowled first-match centurion Will Young for a duck.
<br/>
<br/>
Bangladesh's new pace sensation Nahid Rana took down Kane Williamson caught behind for five with a delivery bowled at 148.8 kph.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra, who returned to the team after recovering from a nasty blow to his forehead in a recent tri-series match against Pakistan, joined Devon Conway to rebuild the innings.
<br/>
<br/>
Conway hit back with a flurry of boundaries and made 30 before Bangladesh checked the surge and Mustafizur Rahman hurried one on to the left-hander who chopped on to his stumps.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra stood firm and with fellow left-hander Latham, another centurion in the opener against Pakistan, waded his way through the chase and after reaching his fifty bossed the bowlers.
<br/>
<br/>
He raised his fourth ODI ton with a single off Rana and raised his bat to soak up the applause.
<br/>
<br/>
"He's doing Rachin things I guess," Santner said of his batter who hit a hundred in his ODI World Cup debut in 2023.
<br/>
<br/>
"He loves ICC events – looks like he never left the game," he added. "He wasn't as fluid as he'd have liked but when he gets going he's tough to stop. His partnerships were good too."
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra's knock was interrupted by an intruder who barged on to the field to hug the batter before being escorted out of the ground by security.
<br/>
<br/>
The young boy, wearing a white shalwar kameez, was carrying a photo of a leader of one of Pakistan's radical religious parties.
<br/>
<br/>
Ravindra finally fell, caught at long-on off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain, and wicketkeeper-batsman Latham's run out added some late drama. But Glenn Phillips, 21 not out, and Bracewell, who hit the winning boundary, sealed the chase.
<br/>
<br/>
Player of the match Bracewell set up victory with key strikes that started with his second delivery to dismiss Tanzid Hasan out for 24 and end a strong start by Bangladesh.
<br/>
<br/>
Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto made 77 and Jaker Ali 45 in an attempt to put up a competitive total but Bracewell kept getting wickets.
<br/>
<br/>
He was ably supported by the New Zealand quicks with rookie Will O'Rourke returning with two wickets. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
US stocks drifted lower on Monday to compound their sharp losses from last week .
<br>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.5 percent to 5,983 after flipping between small gains and losses several times through the day. The relatively modest moves followed its 1.7 percent tumble on Friday, which came after several weaker-than-expected reports on the US economy.
<br/>
<br/>
The Dow added 0.1 percent to 43.461, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 percent to 19,286.
<br/>
<br/>
Berkshire Hathaway climbed 4.1 percent for one of the market’s bigger gains after Warren Buffett’s company reported a jumped in operating profits for the latest quarter.
<br/>
<br/>
Starbucks rose 1.3 percent after saying it would cut 1,100 corporate jobs and leave several hundred more positions unfilled as new CEO Brian Niccol tries to make it a leaner operation.
<br/>
<br/>
Big US companies have broadly been reporting better profits for the last three months of 2024 than analysts expected, which is one of the main reasons the S&amp;P 500 set a record before sliding at the end of last week. The pace of reports will slow this week, but several potentially market-moving updates are still on deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Chief among them is Nvidia, the company that’s become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of what had been nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday will be the company’s first profit report since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the top-flight, most expensive chips. (AP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
US President Donald Trump said on Monday that his tariffs on Canada and Mexico are starting next month, ending a month-long suspension on the planned import taxes that could potentially hurt economic growth and worsen inflation.
<br>
<br/>
“We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” he said at a White House news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
<br/>
<br/>
While Trump was answering a specific question about the taxes to be charged on America's two largest trading partners, the US president also stressed more broadly that his intended “reciprocal” tariffs were on schedule to begin as soon as April.
<br/>
<br/>
“The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump said.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump has claimed that other countries charge unfair import taxes that have come at the expense of domestic manufacturing and jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
His near constant threats of tariffs have already raised concerns among businesses and consumers about an economic slowdown and accelerating inflation.
<br/>
<br/>
But Trump claims that the import taxes would ultimately generate revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit and new jobs for workers.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared confident on Monday that her administration would reach agreements with the US government before the deadline set by Trump.
<br/>
<br/>
“We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” Sheinbaum told reporters before Trump's remarks.
<br/>
<br/>
In high-level discussions between both governments, Mexico has insisted that the US also take a hard look at the drug distribution and consumption in its own country rather than pointing only at production in Mexico, Sheinbaum said. (AP)

World MotoGP champion Jorge Martin will miss the first race of the season this weekend in Thailand after sustaining several fractures in a fall, his Aprilia team announced.
<br>
<br/>
The Spaniard, who previously suffered several fractures when he crashed his Aprilia during pre-season testing in Malaysia, has a number of breaks in his left hand and also in his heel.
<br/>
<br/>
He is due to undergo surgery in Barcelona on Tuesday and "will miss the Thailand Grand Prix", the Italian manufacturer said in a statement. "Recovery times will be determined after the surgery."
<br/>
<br/>
The latest injury is unrelated to the Malaysia crash at the start of February when he broke his right hand and foot after being thrown off his Aprilia at turn two of the Sepang circuit, having emerged unscathed from a crash earlier in the day.
<br/>
<br/>
The 27-year-old, who has already undergone successful surgery on his right hand, made the move to Aprilia after winning the 2024 championship for Pramac Ducati.

<div class="itemFullText">
An automotive sector representative on Tuesday welcomed the rule mandating children under eight to be in a safety seat or strapped in with some other restraining device, saying it provides much needed protection for children travelling in private cars.
<br>
<br/>
Peter Goh, the CEO of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association says there is currently no mandatory requirement for youngsters under the age of three to be restrained in any way in a car.
<br/>
<br/>
"This amendment actually makes it compulsory for all children up to the age of eight to use a [child car seat or restraint of some kind]," he told

</a>
.
<br/>
<br/>
"Now the rule is actually trying to make it better for child safety to ensure that all children are adequately protected while travelling in vehicles," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Goh added that the government is trying to refine the rules and to bring Hong Kong more in line with international regulations.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Goh pointed out that the rule will not apply to children travelling on public transport.
<br/>
<br/>
"Unfortunately, public transport – buses and taxis – is generally exempted from this mandatory rule because of practical and logistic challenges."
<br/>
<br/>
People caught flouting the regulation once it comes into effect in November will risk a fine of HK$230, while "serious cases" could lead to court action and penalties as high as HK$2,000.

<div class="itemFullText">
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday called for "real, lasting peace" this year as European leaders gathered for a summit in Kyiv on the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine.
<br>
<br/>
"We have to win peace through strength and wisdom and unity," Zelensky told Ukraine's backers in Kyiv.
<br/>
<br/>
He vowed at a press conference later that Russia "will not win".
<br/>
<br/>
EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also warned that despite opening talks with the United States on how to end the conflict, Vladimir Putin was not about to back down.
<br/>
<br/>
"Putin is trying harder than ever to win this war on the ground. His goal remains Ukraine's capitulation," she said.
<br/>
<br/>
Russia said it would halt the attack only if a deal could be reached that "suits" its interests, and accused Europe of wanting to prolong the fighting.
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier on Monday, President Xi Jinping held a phone conversation with Putin and said China is happy to see efforts by Moscow and others to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, adding that China and Russia will support each other and achieve common development. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's education sector could face funding cuts as Financial Secretary Paul Chan prepares to deliver his budget speech on Wednesday amid a projected HK$100 billion deficit.
<br>
<br/>
Victor Kwok, deputy research director at Our Hong Kong Foundation, said the education budget has ballooned from about HK$70 billion a decade ago to around HK$110 billion now.
<br/>
<br/>
Kwok thinks the government should avoid blanket budget cuts that could harm daily operations and teaching quality.
<br/>
<br/>
"Now you risk sacrificing some of the things that people have always been doing on a daily basis, because they will be scrambling to find resources and replacements for things that they have always been doing... education quality may be going down as a result of that cut," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
The finance minister previously said universities had relatively large amounts of reserves, calling on everyone to play a part in tackling the budget shortfall.
<br/>
<br/>
While universities have substantial reserves totalling almost HK$140 billion, Kwok cautioned against relying on these funds to offset budget cuts.
<br/>
<br/>
"Ultimately, [a] reserve is a fixed amount and the spending is ongoing. You have to spend every year. So if you're saying, 'oh, they have HK$100 billion in reserves, so let's give them less, and they can spend their reserves first', but one day their reserves will dry up," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Kwok said officials could consider reducing spending on research and encourage universities to develop more sustainable funding models.
<br/>
<br/>
"How do you encourage the university sector in Hong Kong to become more linked to the industry, such that it has more diversified funding resources, and not just solely depending on the government for funding... so that's one area that we can look at," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
For primary and secondary schools, Kwok thinks the government should support merging smaller schools to improve teaching quality and make sure resources are well spent.

<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.6 percent at the open on Tuesday, at 22,716 points.
<br>
<br/>
It comes as world markets are at a delicate juncture, as rising global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty cloud the investment landscape.
<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, South Korean shares fell on Tuesday, as the country's central bank lowered its forecast for this year's economic growth.
<br/>
<br/>
The Bank of Korea (BOK) lowered interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, cutting rates for a third time in the current easing cycle as growth concerns take centre stage.
<br/>
<br/>
The BOK downgraded its forecast for this year's economic growth to 1.5 percent, from 1.9 percent seen in November. It was even weaker than the governor's earlier warning in January that the projection would be lowered to 1.6 percent or 1.7 percent. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Galatasaray have accused Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho of making "racist statements" following a 0-0 draw between the bitter Istanbul rivals.
<br>
<br/>
It was not immediately clear what comments Galatasaray were referring to, and the former Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea and Spurs coach Mourinho has not responded publicly to the allegation.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking following their league draw at Galatasaray, the Portuguese coach reportedly said the home bench had been "jumping like monkeys".
<br/>
<br/>
He also reportedly repeated his criticism of Turkish referees.
<br/>
<br/>
The game was refereed by Slovenia's Slavko Vincic, said to have been appointed after a request from both clubs that a foreign official take charge of the high-profile encounter.
<br/>
<br/>
In its statement, Galatasaray said it would launch criminal proceedings against the 62-year-old Mourinho.
<br/>
<br/>
"Since the commencement of his managerial duties in Turkey, Fenerbahce manager Jose Mourinho has persistently issued derogatory statements directed towards the Turkish people," the club said.
<br/>
<br/>
"Today his discourse has escalated beyond merely immoral comments into unequivocally inhumane rhetoric," it continued.
<br/>
<br/>
"We hereby formally declare our intention to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the racist statements made by Jose Mourinho, and shall accordingly submit official complaints to Uefa and Fifa.
<br/>
<br/>
"Furthermore, we shall diligently observe the stance adopted by Fenerbahce – an institution professing to uphold 'exemplary moral values' – in response to the reprehensible conduct exhibited by their manager."
<br/>
<br/>
There was no immediate comment from Fenerbahce, who are second in the Super Lig six points behind Galatasaray. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer behind the classic "Killing Me Softly With His Song" and one of the most recognisable voices of the 1970s, died on Monday at age 88.
<br>
<br/>
Flack's publicist announced her death without citing a cause.
<br/>
<br/>
The influential pop and R&amp;B star in recent years had lost her ability to sing because of ALS, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, which she was diagnosed with in 2022.
<br/>
<br/>
"She died peacefully surrounded by her family," the statement from the publicist said.
<br/>
<br/>
The classically trained musician with a tender but confident voice produced a number of early classics of rhythm and blues that she frequently described as "scientific soul," timeless works that blended meticulous practice with impeccable taste.
<br/>
<br/>
Her exceptional talent was key to the "quiet storm" radio form of smooth, sensuous slow jams that popularised R&amp;B and influenced its later aesthetics.
<br/>
<br/>
"I've been told I sound like Nina Simone, Nancy Wilson, Odetta, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, even Mahalia Jackson," Flack said in 1970 in The New York Times.
<br/>
<br/>
"If everybody said I sounded like one person, I'd worry. But when they say I sound like them all, I know I've got my own style."
<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer Hudson hailed Flack as "one of the great soul singers of all time," and Roots drummer Questlove wrote "Thank You Robert Flack. Rest in Melody." (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Officials said they are investigating suspicions that some street cleaners have been creating fake work for themselves by putting up posters on lampposts just so they can be seen removing them.
<br>
<br/>
An online video purportedly showed workers posting bills on lampposts on Nam Cheong Street in Sham Shui Po, and then filming themselves removing them, as potential proof of their work.
<br/>
<br/>
A Food and Environmental Hygiene Department spokesman said on Monday that a preliminary investigation found that four workers from an outsourced street cleansing service contractor were involved, and they have been suspended pending further inquiry.
<br/>
<br/>
The department emphasised its commitment to ensuring contractor accountability and has requested a report from the contractor.
<br/>
<br/>
It added that if the investigation confirms the allegations, the contractor could face penalties, including service fee deductions and potential impact on future procurement opportunities.
<br/>
<br/>
The case may also be referred to the police for suspected falsification of records.
<br/>
<br/>
The spokesman clarified that workers are responsible for removing unauthorised posters, but are not given a removal target.
<br/>
<br/>
The department will continue monitoring the contractor to ensure compliance.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The government has urged event organisers to make sure they have sufficient funding before selling tickets, after this year's Digital Art Fair was cancelled just weeks in advance.
<br>
<br/>
Organisers said the cancellation, announced on Monday, is down to reasons beyond its control.
<br/>
<br/>
The event was supposed to be held between March 26-30 as part of "Arts March", which also includes Art Basel and Art Central.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement responding to media questions regarding the cancellation, a spokesperson for the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said organisers of the Digital Art Fair had applied for money from the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, but failed to provide adequate information for authorities to assess the event's artistic merits, attractiveness to tourists, and economic benefits.
<br/>
<br/>
The spokesperson noted that tickets for the event were already on sale when the authorities received and rejected the funding application, adding that sufficient funds should be ensured before tickets are sold for an event to avoid similar situations from occurring in the future.
<br/>
<br/>
Organisers said full refunds will be automatically provided to ticket-holders. General tickets were sold for about HK$320, with VIP tickets going for around HK$960.
<br/>
<br/>
"Digital Art Fair deeply regrets any disappointment this decision may cause to all stakeholders," a statement said.
<br/>
<br/>
The fair was founded in 2021 and aims to show cutting-edge technology in the digital fine art sphere.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Tuesday said he believes a market-led approach in recycling plastic containers and beverage cartons will reduce overall operational costs.
<br>
<br/>
The government plans to introduce legal amendments to require drinks companies to collect plastic bottles and cartons for recycling.
<br/>
<br/>
The bottles and cartons would come with a minimum 10-cent rebate.
<br/>
<br/>
There will be four phases to the plan, and the initial recycling targets will be set at 30 percent for plastic containers and 10 percent for cartons.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking on a radio programme, Tse said companies will be penalised for missing targets.
<br/>
<br/>
"This means requiring beverage importers or manufacturers to make their own arrangements, while the government only sets a target for how much they need to collect, as well as setting a minimum rebate amount," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"So, we believe that a market-driven model will reduce overall operating costs and give companies more flexibility in managing their operations."
<br/>
<br/>
Under the plans, companies can either handle recycling themselves or hire scheme operators.
<br/>
<br/>
Simon Wong, president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that it could be difficult for small and medium-sized companies to implement the scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
"Plastic bottles and drink cartons will need a special label for recycling to help people get their 10-cent refund when recycling. But it might not be easy for some importers because adding these special labels to their products isn't simple and requires changes to their production process," he said.

A motoring group has welcomed a change in the law which will allow drivers to use technology to get their cars to park themselves.
<br>
<br/>
From March 1, it will be legal for motorists to use smartphones or other devices to enable remote control parking.
<br/>
<br/>
Honorary life president of the Hong Kong, China Automobile Association, Ringo Lee, told RTHK on Tuesday that the technology will be especially useful when parking in tight spots.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think it's absolutely safe for those who aren't familiar with driving, or even novice drivers. Because the vehicle itself makes use of a lot of technology... laser or infrared cameras, etc... to park. It's not parking arbitrarily," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Lee said insurance companies should expand third-party insurance to cover drivers in the event an incident is caused by a faulty car system.
<br/>
<br/>
Other transport-related rule changes from March 1 include allowing dashboard monitors in vehicles to show non-driving related content once the handbrake is on, and more types of electric vehicles will be allowed to use expressways without the need for a permit.

<div class="itemFullText">
Unionists on Tuesday said the government should allocate more resources to improve Hong Kong’s vocational training system to cultivate more locally skilled talent.
<br>
<br/>
The Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) surveyed 120 vocational training students between October and December last year.
<br/>
<br/>
Over 70 percent of respondents said they were able to land a job within three months of graduation, and more than 90 percent agreed career education in junior secondary years should be strengthened.
<br/>
<br/>
Alice Tang, the general secretary of the FTU’s occupational retraining centre, said it is important to encourage young people to think about different career paths while they are still at school.
<br/>
<br/>
“We believe education is a crucial point. If we cannot start from adolescence, or the student’s level, we cannot [emphasise] the importance of vocational training. The education is not only for students, it is also for their parents and teachers,” Tang said.
<br/>
<br/>
The union suggested the government increase social recognition towards applied learning subjects in the HKDSE public examination, by raising the highest attainable level from four to five.
<br/>
<br/>
It said this would draw more connections between students' learning experiences and their career development, therefore encouraging more to consider a path outside of traditional academics.
<br/>
<br/>
The FTU also called for an improvement in the social status of skilled labour, while providing more opportunities for people to advance in their careers, as a way to solve the labour shortage problem.
<br/>
<br/>
“Our strategy is to enhance professional career education, and the main theme is to enhance [students'] working skill level, so that they can reach local and overseas needs. If we can cooperate with all of society, we can reach our goal,” Tang said.

<div class="itemFullText">
A new law requiring child car seats or other extra restraints to be fitted in private vehicles carrying children would be too difficult to implement on public transport, the government said on Tuesday.
<br>
<br/>
From November, child restraining devices must be used in private cars for children under eight, unless they are at least 1.35 metres tall.
<br/>
<br/>
A chief engineer at the Transport Department, Eddy Wu, said half of traffic accidents affecting under eights involve private cars.
<br/>
<br/>
He added that it would be difficult for public transport operators to install restraining devices to suit all child passengers.
<br/>
<br/>
"Children of different ages require different kinds of restraints. For example, older children only need a booster seat, while infants need a baby car seat," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"If public transport operators also had to offer suitable devices for children of different ages, or offer a certain quantity, it might create obstacles for their daily operations."
<br/>
<br/>
Wu also explained why children at least 1.35 metres tall will not need extra restraints. He said this is because their feet will touch the floor and an adult seatbelt would not cut into their necks.

<div class="itemFullText">
Police arrested two men following a raid on a drug warehouse, where officers seized approximately 520 kilogrammes of suspected cocaine, valued at over HK$430 million.
<br>
<br/>
Officers intercepted the men at a residential building in Tseung Kwan O on Sunday, discovering two kilos of cocaine in one man's bag, along with an additional 518 kilos in their unit.
<br/>
<br/>
Senior Inspector Tong Wai-kwok, from the Narcotics Bureau, said the cocaine was suspected to have been smuggled into the city from South America via shipping freight.
<br/>
<br/>
"The drug trafficking group simultaneously rented a unit in Kwai Chung, where they used legitimate logistics companies to transport drugs arriving in Hong Kong to the Kwai Chung unit for processing," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"There, over 1,500 boxes of frozen goods were inspected, and some cocaine concealed within was extracted, repackaged, and disguised as regular cargo. The drugs were then transferred to a private residential unit for storage and distribution."
<br/>
<br/>
Tong said the group frequently changed locations through different logistics and transport companies to evade detection.
<br/>
<br/>
Chief Superintendent Ng Kwok-Cheung said the two men, aged 22 and 23, were unemployed and likely committed these crimes to make money quickly.
<br/>
<br/>
The two men were arrested for drug trafficking, and the case will be brought to the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Wednesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
South Korea's ousted President Yoon Suk-yeol faced his final impeachment hearing on Tuesday before judges decide whether to formally remove him from office over his disastrous martial law declaration.
<br>
<br/>
Yoon's short-lived suspension of civilian rule plunged democratic South Korea into political turmoil, and he was removed from office by parliament in December.
<br/>
<br/>
The 64-year-old has been behind bars since he was arrested last month on charges of insurrection, for which he could be sentenced to life in prison or even face the death penalty.
<br/>
<br/>
His trial began last week.
<br/>
<br/>
After weeks of fraught impeachment hearings at the Constitutional Court in Seoul, Tuesday's court session was his last before the eight judges go behind closed doors to decide his fate.
<br/>
<br/>
Proceedings began at 2pm but Yoon was not present, reporters said.
<br/>
<br/>
A number of lawmakers from his ruling People Power Party were in attendance, however.
<br/>
<br/>
In opening remarks, Yoon's defence team cited a 2024 US Supreme Court ruling, Donald Trump v. the United States, arguing the ousted president cannot be punished for "exercising his core constitutional powers".
<br/>
<br/>
That ruling "should be considered in the context of impeachment proceedings", Yoon's lawyer Lee Dong-chan said.
<br/>
<br/>
Yoon is expected to deliver a closing argument in his defence, with representatives of parliament given time to present the case for his removal.
<br/>
<br/>
Outside the court, pro-Yoon protesters chanted "Drop impeachment!"
<br/>
<br/>
Others held signs saying "Stop the Steal", echoing US President Trump's false claims of voter fraud when he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden.
<br/>
<br/>
A verdict is widely expected in mid-March.
<br/>
<br/>
Previously impeached presidents Park Geun-hye and Roh Moo-hyun had to wait 11 and 14 days, respectively, to learn their fates.
<br/>
<br/>
If Yoon is removed from office, the country must hold a fresh presidential election within 60 days. (AFP)

Hong Kong Disneyland on Tuesday said it enjoyed its strongest ever business performance in the last fiscal year, with a record net profit of more than HK$830 million and highest ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
<br>
<br/>
The theme park said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
Managing director Michael Moriarty said the park will be celebrating its 20th anniversary from June onwards.
<br/>
<br/>
“Hong Kong Disneyland's 20th anniversary is going to be one of the top mega events for the town to rally around. We're working with other partners as well who are just as excited,” he said.
<br/>
<br/>
“I think with our combined effort, this can be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals, giving reasons for people to come back, not to just to Hong Kong Disneyland, but to Hong Kong.”
<br/>
<br/>
Moriarty said the celebrations will include the park's largest ever parade called “Friendtastic!”, and a special edition of the night show “Momentous”.
<br/>
<br/>
The park will also expand its Marvel-themed section and create a Pixar entertainment experience, with construction work to begin this year.
<br/>
<br/>
The theme park also announced a pay rise of 3.6 to 5 percent for eligible cast members, backdated to the beginning of this year.
<br/>
<br/>
It said eligible full-time staff will also be awarded discretionary bonuses equivalent to 1.8 to 2.4 months' worth of their base salary.

Four people, including two Chinese nationals, were killed and six injured after a bridge collapsed at an expressway construction site in South Korea on Tuesday, authorities said.
<br>
<br/>
Local media aired dramatic footage of what appeared to be a section of the bridge collapsing, sending a massive cloud of smoke into the air.
<br/>
<br/>
Four people were killed, five were seriously injured and one suffered a minor injury, a statement from the National Fire Agency said.
<br/>
<br/>
Of those killed, two were Chinese nationals and two were South Koreans, an interior ministry official told AFP.
<br/>
<br/>
The incident occurred at around 9.50am in Anseong, around 65 kilometres south of the South Korean capital.
<br/>
<br/>
"All individuals who suffered injuries are currently being treated at hospitals," the National Fire Agency's spokesperson said.
<br/>
<br/>
The National Fire Agency initially said it took place in the nearby city of Cheonan but later corrected that claim.
<br/>
<br/>
Hyundai Engineering, the main contractor of the construction site, apologised and said it was assisting authorities.
<br/>
<br/>
"We sincerely bow our heads in apology to those who lost their precious lives and were injured in the accident at our construction site," it said.
<br/>
<br/>
"We are actively cooperating with the relevant authorities to ensure a prompt resolution on-site" and to identify the cause of the accident, the company said.
<br/>
<br/>
Acting President Choi Sang-mok issued urgent directives to mobilise all available resources and personnel for the rescue operation. (AFP)

The Cross-Harbour Tunnel was forced to shut partially for more than an hour on Tuesday after a piece of concrete fell from the ceiling and hit a vehicle.
<br>
<br/>
Police said they received a report shortly after 1pm of a car travelling through the tunnel being hit by a concrete slab that measured about 50cm by 50cm.
<br/>
<br/>
No one was hurt in the incident.
<br/>
<br/>
The Hong Kong Island-bound fast lane was closed for emergency repair works, leading to congestion. It was reopened to traffic at 2.48pm.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Hong Kong's exports growth slowed significantly last month, while imports picked up, according to official figures.
<br>
<br/>
Data released by the Census and Statistics Department on Tuesday showed that the value of the city's total exports of goods rose just 0.1 percent year-on-year to HK$389.1 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
That compares with a 5.1 percent annual rise in December and 2.1 percent increase in November, and was the slowest pace of growth in almost a year.
<br/>
<br/>
The value of total imports, however, rose 0.5 percent year-on-year last month to stand at HK$387.1 billion, following a 1.1 percent contraction in December and growth of 5.7 percent in November.
<br/>
<br/>
A government spokesperson partly attributed January's moderate growth to the timing of Lunar New Year, and said it is more appropriate to analyse the trade data for the January-February period combined.
<br/>
<br/>
"Looking ahead, while uncertainties in the external environment, in particular escalating trade protectionism, would continue to weigh on Hong Kong's export performance, steady global economic growth, together with the Central Government's various measures to boost the mainland economy, would provide support," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
Police have arrested three people for allegedly claiming they had spare tickets on sale for the opening ceremony of the Kai Tak Sports Park on Saturday, with tickets reportedly being offered at marked up prices.
<br>
<br/>
A total of 8,500 tickets for the opening ceremony on March 1 were available at HK$10 each and were snapped up within around half an hour of being available on February 21.
<br/>
<br/>
As many as 33,600 spectators are expected to attend the star-studded event.
<br/>
<br/>
Those who successfully made a purchase online via a real-name registration system will first receive electronic vouchers to exchange for the real tickets at a later date.
<br/>
<br/>
At a press conference on Tuesday, police officers accused the trio of jacking up the prices and intending to sell the tickets online at a range between HK$100 and HK$2,000 each.
<br/>
<br/>
Preliminary investigations showed two of the suspects did not hold the vouchers and the force has yet to ascertain whether the coupon held by the remaining person was authentic.
<br/>
<br/>
The force added it has not ruled out making further arrests.
<br/>
<br/>
Sports commissioner George Tsoi said successful buyers can only get the actual tickets from Thursday, two days before the opening ceremony.
<br/>
<br/>
"When the exchange takes place, we will check the voucher holder's identity. If the identity does not match, no tickets will be issued, and the person will not be able to enter the venue," he said.

Rain washed out the Champions Trophy game between South Africa and two-time winner Australia on Tuesday without a ball being bowled.
<br>
<br/>
The pitch remained under covers at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium throughout the day because of a persistent light drizzle before umpires called off the game shortly after 5 pm local time.
<br/>
<br/>
Both unbeaten teams go into their last Group B game with a chance to qualify for the semi-finals with three points already secured. Australia play against Afghanistan at Lahore on Friday while South Africa meet England at Karachi on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
South Africa and Australia began their campaigns by posting 300-plus scores against Afghanistan and England, respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
Australia, coming into the Champions Trophy without three frontline fast bowlers, made the tournament’s highest-ever chase of 352 on the back of Josh Inglis’ century against England at Lahore.
<br/>
<br/>
South Africa registered an emphatic 107-run win over Afghanistan at Karachi after Ryan Rickelton made his maiden ODI hundred in a strong total of 315-6.
<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand and India have already qualified for the semi-finals after winning both their Group A games against Pakistan and Afghanistan.
<br/>
<br/>
England will take on Afghanistan in a must-win game for both teams to stay in semi-final contention in Lahore on Wednesday. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
A fresh search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been launched more than a decade after the plane went missing in one of aviation's greatest enduring mysteries.
<br>
<br/>
Maritime exploration firm Ocean Infinity has resumed the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said on Tuesday.
<br/>
<br/>
Loke told reporters contract details between Malaysia and the firm were still being finalised but welcomed "the proactiveness of Ocean Infinity to deploy their ships" to begin the search for the plane, which went missing in March 2014.
<br/>
<br/>
Loke said details about how long the search would last had not been negotiated yet.
<br/>
<br/>
He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm restarted its hunt.
<br/>
<br/>
The Malaysian government said in December it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370.
<br/>
<br/>
The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
<br/>
<br/>
Two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.
<br/>
<br/>
The plane has never been found despite the largest search in aviation history.
<br/>
<br/>
"We're very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus," said Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet.
<br/>
<br/>
Jaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.
<br/>
<br/>
"We just want to know where it is and what happened," she said. "Memories come back like yesterday, it's fresh in our heads."
<br/>
<br/>
Loke said in December the new search would be on the same "no find, no fee" principle as Ocean Infinity's previous search, with the government only paying out if the firm finds the aircraft.
<br/>
<br/>
The contract was for 18 months and Malaysia would pay US$70 million to the company if the plane was found, Loke had previously said.
<br/>
<br/>
Ocean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.
<br/>
<br/>
The company's first efforts followed a massive Australia-led search for the aircraft that lasted three years before it was suspended in January 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
The Australia-led search covered 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles) in the Indian Ocean but found hardly any trace of the plane other than a few pieces of debris.
<br/>
<br/>
Loke said in December a new 15,000 square kilometre (5,800 square mile) area of the southern Indian Ocean would be scoured by Ocean Infinity.
<br/>
<br/>
"They combined all the data and they felt confident that the current search area is more credible," Loke said on Tuesday.
<br/>
<br/>
"They have convinced us that they are ready."
<br/>
<br/>
The plane's disappearance has long been the subject of theories, ranging from the credible to the outlandish, including that veteran pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah had gone rogue.
<br/>
<br/>
A final report into the tragedy released in 2018 pointed to failings by air traffic control and said the plane's course was changed manually. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
A man on Tuesday was sentenced to 14 months in prison for trafficking in a dangerous drug last year.
<br>
<br/>
The 24-year-old man was arrested in November as he was leaving Hong Kong from the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point.
<br/>
<br/>
Officers seized about 0.3 grammes of cocaine under the insole of his sneaker.
<br/>
<br/>
He was sentenced at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.
<br/>
<br/>
The Customs and Excise Department welcomed the deterrent sentence, saying it duly reflected the gravity of the offence.
<br/>
<br/>
Under the law, the maximum penalty for dangerous drug trafficking upon conviction is a fine of HK$5 million and life imprisonment.

<div class="itemFullText">
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Tuesday pledged to boost defence spending to 2.5 percent of the economy by 2027 with the aim of hiking it to 3 percent in the next parliament.
<br>
<br/>
Ahead of key talks on Ukraine with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday, Starmer told parliament the increase would be funded by cutting overseas development aid from 0.5 percent to 0.3 percent of the economy.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump has demanded that Nato allies more than double their defence spending targets to five percent of economic output.
<br/>
<br/>
The UK spent 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence in 2023/24.
<br/>
<br/>
Starmer's Labour government had previously committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent, but had not set a timeline.
<br/>
<br/>
He told lawmakers there would be some "hard choices" but it would be the "biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War."
<br/>
<br/>
The government would also "set a clear ambition for defence spending to rise to 3 percent of GDP in the next parliament," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump has repeatedly called on European nations to boost their defence spending.
<br/>
<br/>
"The nature of warfare has changed significantly. That is clear from the battlefield in Ukraine, and so we must modernise and reform our capabilities as we invest," Starmer said.
<br/>
<br/>
"This investment means that the UK will strengthen its position as a leader in Nato and in the collective defence of our continent, and we should welcome that role." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
French President Emmanuel Macron will brief fellow EU leaders on Wednesday on his talks with US President Donald Trump, ahead of an emergency summit on European support for Ukraine.
<br>
<br/>
Antonio Costa, who heads the European Council representing the bloc's 27 member states, announced on X he had convened a videoconference with Macron to prepare for the March 6 leaders' talks.
<br/>
<br/>
Europe has scrambled for a unified response since Trump two weeks ago declared his readiness to negotiate with Russia – and without European involvement – on ending the three-year-old Ukraine war.
<br/>
<br/>
Despite a veneer of cordiality, the transatlantic rift over Ukraine was on display during Macron's talks with Trump on Monday – the third anniversary of the war.
<br/>
<br/>
The French leader warned at the White House afterwards that peace cannot mean the "surrender" of Ukraine.
<br/>
<br/>
"We want a quick deal but not a fragile one," said Macron, who insisted any settlement must include US security guarantees for Kyiv – to prevent any future Russian assault.
<br/>
<br/>
In parallel, the United States sided with Russia in two votes at the United Nations on Monday to avoid condemning Moscow's campaign against Ukraine – a seismic shift from the stance of the previous US administration.
<br/>
<br/>
Trump's embrace of Russia has sparked fears that it could herald the end of US support for Kyiv and a major change in attitude toward the rest of Europe.
<br/>
<br/>
Next week's talks in Brussels will focus on supporting Kyiv and bolstering Europe's defences after Trump's opening to Moscow – at what Costa called "a defining moment for Ukraine and European security." (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
With the government facing a budget shortfall of almost HK$100 billion, all eyes will be on how the financial secretary plans to cut spending and increase revenue when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday.
<br>
<br/>
Paul Chan is expected to address civil service pay and announce possible reductions in expenditure in some areas.
<br/>
<br/>
Some people see freezing or even reducing civil service pay as a way to help rein in the deficit and achieve fiscal stability.
<br/>
<br/>
But others argued that such a move could have a knock-on effect for the wider workforce, as many private firms refer to government salaries in making their own wage decisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Lawmaker Ronick Chan, representing the finance constituency, has said freezing or cutting civil service pay would affect millions of workers in the city, and may cause changes in people's consumption patterns, leading to a vicious cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
Officials may also try to save money by cutting spending in other areas, with the financial secretary having cited healthcare and education earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
Health minister Lo Chung-mau has said putting public resources to good use is everyone's responsibility. "Nobody should be wasteful... It should be everyone in Hong Kong, and all government departments... We hope our patients make good use of healthcare resources and don't waste medicine. Like they take extra and just keep them at home, or even throw them away."
<br/>
<br/>
The chairman of the Hospital Authority, Henry Fan, said the authority will fully cooperate with government policies.
<br/>
<br/>
Paul Chan stressed the government will propose an enhanced fiscal-consolidation strategy to control public expenditure stringently, while using other public resources to speed up the city's development.
<br/>
<br/>
On ways to boost revenue, he has highlighted the user-pays principle, meaning those who can afford to should pay more and at the same time minimising the impact to the average people.
<br/>
<br/>
The Taxation Institute said the government could consider raising the standard salaries tax rate for high-income earners from 16 percent to 17 percent, to help boost the public coffers.
<br/>
<br/>
But the financial secretary has also said the administration will have to tread carefully when considering tax reforms, and many factors have to be taken into consideration.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
More than 20 civil service employees resigned on Tuesday from billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), saying they were refusing to use their technical expertise to “dismantle critical public services”.
<br>
<br/>
“We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,” the 21 staffers wrote in a joint resignation letter. “However, it has become clear that we can no longer honour those commitments.”
<br/>
<br/>
The employees also said many of those enlisted by Musk to help him slash the size of the federal government under President Donald Trump's administration did not have the necessary skills or experience for the task ahead of them.
<br/>
<br/>
The mass resignation of engineers, data scientists, designers and product managers is a temporary setback for Musk and the Republican president's tech-driven purge of the federal workforce. It comes amid a flurry of court challenges that have sought to stall, stop or unwind their efforts to fire or coerce thousands of government workers out of jobs.
<br/>
<br/>
In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was dismissive of the mass resignation.
<br/>
<br/>
“Anyone who thinks protests, lawsuits, and lawfare will deter President Trump must have been sleeping under a rock for the past several years," Leavitt said. "President Trump will not be deterred from delivering on the promises he made to make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers.”
<br/>
<br/>
Musk posted on his social media site X that the story was “fake news” and suggested that the staffers were “Dem political holdovers" who “would have been fired had they not resigned.”
<br/>
<br/>
The staffers who resigned had worked for the United States Digital Service, but said their duties were being integrated into Doge.
<br/>
<br/>
Their former office, the USDS, was established under President Obama after the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, the web portal that millions of Americans use to sign up for insurance plans through the Democrat's signature health care law.
<br/>
<br/>
All previously held senior roles at such tech companies as Google and Amazon and wrote in their resignation letter that they joined the government out of a sense of duty to public service. (AP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Venezuela will soon have its first saint, after ailing Pope Francis on Tuesday canonised a physician who died more than 100 years ago, revered for his selfless service during a previous pandemic.
<br>
<br/>
Jose Gregorio Hernandez was born in 1864, studied in Paris, Berlin, Madrid and New York, and died in Caracas in 1919 after being struck by a car.
<br/>
<br/>
He was beatified – an earlier step towards sainthood – in 2021 amid a surge of coronavirus cases in Venezuela, a century after Hernandez became known as the "doctor of the poor" caring for patients during another major global pandemic, the Spanish flu.

<br/>
His beatification was made possible after a "miracle" attributed to him was recognised by the Church – the recovery of a 10-year-old girl who had been shot in the head in 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
Doctors had said she would be permanently brain damaged if she survived, but the girl recovered after her mother prayed to Hernandez.
<br/>
<br/>
Francis approved the canonisation of Hernandez and another new saint from his hospital bed in Rome, where he is being treated for double pneumonia, the Vatican said.
<br/>
<br/>
Following the pontiff's approval, canonisation is usually formalised at a special mass in honour of the new saint. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Chelsea moved into the Premier League's top four with a 4-0 demolition of hapless Southampton, but Aston Villa's hopes of Champions League football next season diminished after a 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.
<br>
<br/>
After a run of three consecutive defeats, Chelsea badly needed a response against bottom-of-the-table Saints, who are set for an immediate return to the Championship.
<br/>
<br/>
The Blues duly delivered with three first-half goals through Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Levi Colwill for just a third league win 11 games.
<br/>
<br/>
Before kick-off at Stamford Bridge, a small band of Chelsea fans gathered to protest against the club's owners over the club's form and discontent over ticket prices.
<br/>
<br/>
Once the action got underway, it was a much-needed comfortable evening for Enzo Maresca's men which the Italian will hope can restore confidence among his squad.
<br/>
<br/>
Nkunku took his tally for the season to 14 but only three of those have come in the Premier League as he has often had to play reserve to the injured Nicolas Jackson.
<br/>
<br/>
The Frenchman stooped to head in a corner at the back post before teeing up Neto to blast home a second.
<br/>
<br/>
Colwill headed in Neto's free-kick to make the points safe before the break. Marc Cucurella rounded off the scoring with a calm finish from teenager Tyrique George's cross.
<br/>
<br/>
Victory takes Chelsea two points above Manchester City into fourth.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to English clubs' strong performance in European competition this season, a top-five finish is likely to be enough for a place in next season's Champions League.
<br/>
<br/>
Villa had rejuvenated their hopes of a second consecutive season in Europe's elite competition after beating Chelsea on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
But Unai Emery's men have won just one of their last seven league games after a capitulation at Selhurst Park.
<br/>
<br/>
Ismaila Sarr's first-half opener was cancelled out early in the second period by Morgan Rogers.
<br/>
<br/>
Jean-Philippe Mateta quickly restored Palace's advantage before Sarr and Eddie Nketiah maintained the Eagles fine form.
<br/>
<br/>
Oliver Glasner's side have won seven of their last nine games to rise to 12th, just six points behind Villa in 10th.
<br/>
<br/>
Brighton won the battle of the south coast clubs with ambitions of European football next season, over Bournemouth 2-1.
<br/>
<br/>
Joao Pedro won and converted a penalty on 12 minutes to give the Seagulls the lead.
<br/>
<br/>
A wonder strike from Justin Kluivert levelled for the Cherries, but Danny Welbeck's winner moved the sides level on points.
<br/>
<br/>
Bournemouth sit seventh on goal difference with Brighton in eighth, but now just one point behind fifth-placed City.
<br/>
<br/>
Wolves missed the chance to pull further clear of the relegation zone after a 2-1 home defeat to Fulham.
<br/>
<br/>
A fast start to both halves saw the visitors take the points as Ryan Sessegnon struck inside the first minute and Rodrigo Muniz got the winner two minutes into the second period.
<br/>
<br/>
Wolves remain five points above the bottom three.
<br/>
<br/>
League leaders Liverpool can take another step towards just their second title in 35 years when they host Newcastle on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
Second faces third as Arsenal visit Nottingham Forest, while Tottenham host City. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Some of Wall Street’s brightest stars lost more of their shine on Tuesday after another report said US households are getting more pessimistic about the economy.
<br>
<br/>
The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 5,995 – it's fourth straight drop after setting an all-time high last week.
<br/>
<br/>
The Nasdaq composite sank 1.4 percent to 19,026 as several influential Big Tech companies lost momentum and screeched lower.
<br/>
<br/>
But the majority of stocks nevertheless rose, which helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average add 159 points, or 0.4 percent to 43,621.
<br/>
<br/>
The US stock market has been generally struggling since the middle of last week after several weaker-than-expected reports on the economy thudded onto Wall Street.
<br/>
<br/>
On Tuesday, the latest said confidence among US consumers is falling by more than economists expected.
<br/>
<br/>
The pessimism hit high-momentum areas of the market in particular, those that had seen waves of euphoric investors pile in during recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
Nvidia fell 2.8 percent, for example, while Tesla tumbled 8.4 percent. They were the two heaviest weights on the S&amp;P 500.
<br/>
<br/>
Bitcoin likewise sank, falling back toward US$88,000, which dragged down stocks of companies in the crypto industry.
<br/>
<br/>
MicroStrategy, the company that’s raised money in order to buy more bitcoin and now goes by the name Strategy, fell 11.4 percent.
<br/>
<br/>
Zoom Communications dropped 8.5 percent even though it reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected.
<br/>
<br/>
They helped offset a 2.8 percent rise for Home Depot, which delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Along with Home Depot, the majority of stocks within the S&amp;P 500 rose.
<br/>
<br/>
The pace of profit reports is slowing, but the potentially most anticipated report is still to come on Wednesday. That’s Nvidia, which has grown to become one of Wall Street’s most influential stocks because of nearly insatiable demand for its chips.
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday will provide the first earnings report for the company and its CEO, Jensen Huang, since a Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, upended the artificial-intelligence industry by saying it developed a large language model that can compete with big US rivals without having to use the most expensive chips.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Atlético Madrid conceded a two-goal lead then fought back from two down in a wild 4-4 draw with Barcelona in a Copa del Rey semi-final first leg thriller.
<br>
<br/>
After Diego Simeone's side scored twice in the opening six minutes through Julián Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann, Barca raced through the gears in a high-octane performance.
<br/>
<br/>
The superb Pedri Gonzalez pulled one back with Pau Cubarsi, Inigo Martinez and Robert Lewandowski going on to score for the Catalan giants.
<br/>
<br/>
Marcos Llorente netted for Atletico before Alexander Sorloth struck in the 93rd minute to leave the tie perfectly poised ahead of the second leg at the Metropolitano stadium on April 2.
<br/>
<br/>
"It's a terrible result when you go 4-2 up," Pedri said. "You have to be more careful, these are things we have to learn."
<br/>
<br/>
"Today we started badly but I'll focus on how the team reacted," he added. "When we got in front we have to be calmer. The second leg will be difficult, but we will go there to try and win."
<br/>
<br/>
Hansi Flick left Barca's top goalscorer Lewandowski out of the starting line-up, with Ferran Torres taking his place in a false nine role.
<br/>
<br/>
Simeone picked a strong side despite his side's extremely tricky fixture list, with this the first of three matches against Barca and a Champions League last 16 tie against Real Madrid on the horizon.
<br/>
<br/>
Atlético took the lead inside the first minute, with Alvarez pouncing at the back post after Griezmann's cross was flicked on.
<br/>
<br/>
Atlético doubled their lead in the sixth minute when Jules Kounde gave the ball away and Alvarez produced a stunning pass to release Griezmann.
<br/>
<br/>
The French forward was being pressured by Alejandro Balde but cleverly worked room for a shot, which Wojciech Szczesny got a hand to but could not keep out.
<br/>
<br/>
After Atletico's opening salvo, Barcelona dominated the rest of the first half.
<br/>
<br/>
Ferran Torres should have levelled for Barcelona after Raphinha sent him through on goal but his shot was week and Atlético goalkeeper Juan Musso saved easily.
<br/>
<br/>
The La Liga leaders hit two goals in two minutes to pull back level, with Kounde setting up Pedri for the first before Cubarsi nodded home from a corner.
<br/>
<br/>
Torres spurned another golden chance for Barca's third, rounding Musso but misfiring under pressure from Clement Lenglet, on loan from the Catalans at Atlético. (AFP)

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
A hospitality expert on Wednesday said Hong Kong Disneylands’s performance is welcome news, after the amusement park reported records in profit and attendance.
<br>
<br/>
Hong Kong Disneyland reported a net profit of more than HK$830 million, and its highest-ever attendance figure of 7.7 million.
<br/>
<br/>
The park also said its revenue grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year to HK$8.8 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
“This is truly good news and it seems that Disney has been performing quite well in maintaining their uniqueness as an attraction among all the international visitors in Hong Kong," the Vocational Training Council’s Dennis Wong told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme.
<br/>
<br/>
While Wong noted Disney has successfully maintained a strong local and mainland customer core, he said they should keep innovating to attract new visitors.
<br/>
<br/>
“Certainly, they have to maintain the freshness of their product. That’s not only maintaining the physical rides, but they have to make sure they will continue rolling out a lot of events and campaigns.”
<br/>
<br/>
The park will be marking its 20th anniversary from June onward, with its managing director saying the celebrations could be a major draw for Hong Kong arrivals.

Elsewhere, Australian consumer prices dipped month-on-month in January, dragged lower by a slowdown in housing costs and a drop in holiday travel, an outcome that should help reassure policymakers that inflation is heading in the right direction.
<br/>
<br/>
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed the monthly consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.2 percent in January from December, when it rose 0.8 percent. The annual pace held at 2.5 percent, matching market forecasts. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday delivered his 2025-26 budget to the Legislative Council.
<br>
<br/>
Chan started the speech for his financial blueprint – which aims to tackle an estimated HK$100 billion deficit – by saying that Hong Kong needs to reform, innovate and relentlessly improve.
<br/>
<br/>
He pointed out that though counter-cyclical measures launched in the past few years to counter the pandemic have stabilised the economy and eased people’s burden, it has resulted in a fiscal deficit.
<br/>
<br/>
“In this budget, I propose a reinforced version of the fiscal consolidation programme, including a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28," he told lawmakers at Legco.
<br/>
<br/>
“Strictly containing public expenditure is a must, but we should proceed in a steady and prudent manner, and be careful to find a balance among the various impacts that may arise in the process.”
<br/>
<br/>
The finance minister also said the “approach represents our all-out effort to minimise the impact on public services and people's livelihood”, adding that "it gives us a clear pathway towards the goal of restoring fiscal balance”.
<br/>
<br/>
On the SAR's economic growth, Chan said authorities forecast that Hong Kong's gross domestic product will continue to grow moderately this year, rising two to three percent in real terms.
<br/>
<br/>
The economy grew by 2.5 percent in 2024.
<br/>
<br/>
He also forecast that the economy will grow, on average, by 2.9 percent a year in real terms from 2026 to 2029, with underlying inflation expected to be at an average of 2.5 percent a year.

Artificial intelligence will be at the heart of the government's efforts to turn the city into an Innovation and Technology (I&amp;T) and science centre for Asia, according to the financial secretary.
<br>
<br/>
As he delivered the budget for 2025-26, Paul Chan pledged the government would support Hong Kong's R&amp;D efforts as well as the industrial application of AI.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said the government would set aside HK$1 billion for the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute.
<br/>
<br/>
The finance chief also said the city would enter the Low Earth Orbit satellite sector, calling it the "new trend in global satellite development".
<br/>
<br/>
The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Office of the Communications Authority would explore a set of streamlined procedures for vetting licence applications for operating Low Earth Orbit satellites, with the relevant work to be completed by this year.
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the government would draw up a medium- to long‑term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong, with a HK$10 billion I&amp;T Industry‑Oriented Fund to channel more capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said the government would invite relevant organisations show their interest in the plans and will to seek funding approval from Legco in the middle of this year.

The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) will get HK$1.2 billion from the government in the coming year to fund its efforts to attract visitors to the city and pursue the concept of "tourism is everywhere".
<br>
<br/>
Panda tourism, horse-racing tourism and eco-tourism will be among the products to be promoted, Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced his budget address on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
"The HKTB will collaborate with more international brands to tell the good stories of Hong Kong's tourism," Chan said.
<br/>
<br/>
"[The board] will continue to support the staging of more meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions in Hong Kong, which are expected to bring about 183,000 additional visitor arrivals and spending of about HK$1.4 billion."
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said he has earmarked money to be spent on encouraging cruise ships to make more calls to Hong Kong and use the city as their home port.
<br/>
<br/>
The financial chief noted that officials are making an effort to attract more people to take in the sights along Victoria Harbour, adding that new refreshment stalls are planned in various locations "to enrich visitor experience".
<br/>
<br/>
The government has also asked MTR bosses to look into whether the waterfront and former pier sites south of Hung Hom Station can be used for commercial and residential developments, including a yacht club, Chan said.

The government will increase its support for electric vehicles (EVs) by launching a HK$300 million subsidy scheme in the middle of the year for a citywide charging network.
<br>
<br/>
Paul Chan said it is expected the scheme would provide impetus for the industry to install 3,000 fast chargers for EVs across Hong Kong by 2030.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan noted the need for more charging stations given there are more than 100,000 EVs in Hong Kong, about eight times compared with five years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
The financial secretary also announced new initiatives to enhance waste reduction at source.
<br/>
<br/>
He said the government would allocate additional funding of HK$180 million for increasing the number of residential food waste smart recycling bins and food waste collection facilities across the city, as well as expanding the city's recycling network and increasing waste recovery.

The government said it will explore regulating basketball betting activities and invite the Hong Kong Jockey Club to submit a proposal on the matter.
<br>
<br/>
Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday that there have been public concerns about illegal basketball betting in the city in recent years.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said according to the latest Jockey Club assessment, turnover of illegal basketball betting reached HK$70 billion to HK$90 billion last year, and he stressed the need to combat illegal betting activities in an effective manner.
<br/>
<br/>
The Hong Kong Jockey Club said in a statement that it would submit a detailed proposal to the government, adding it is eager to collaborate on this important policy initiative.
<br/>
<br/>
The club said the move is essential for addressing the surge in illegal basketball betting, which has contributed to social issues such as loan sharking and underage gambling.
<br/>
<br/>
It added that regulating basketball betting would not only combat illegal betting activities, but also enhance the club's ability to make charitable contributions and generate tax revenues.
<br/>
<br/>
Sports sector lawmaker Kenneth Fok welcomed the move, noting that this approach would not only tackle illegal gambling, but also channel related revenues back to the city.
<br/>
<br/>
The proposal is projected to generate an additional HK$1.5 billion to HK$2 billion in gambling tax revenue annually for Hong Kong.
<br/>
<br/>
"I would urge the government on one hand to discuss and also legalise the basketball gambling activities, but on the other hand increase its effort into educating the public through different institutions to make the public aware of the dangers of over gambling or gambling addiction," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"[The] NBA also would have more activities in this region, not just in Hong Kong but in our neighbouring Macau. They are planning a lot of new activities which will bring in more fans. This is also maybe a result of such attention on basketball."
<br/>
<br/>
Fok hopes the Jockey Club can launch related betting projects before the start of the next NBA season.
<br/>
<br/>
Professor Patrick Lau from the department of sport, physical education and health at Baptist University said that while regulating basketball betting might provide a temporary solution to curbing illegal activities, the long-term consequences could be harmful.
<br/>
<br/>
"For the long term, the underground betting is still there. The controversial discussion about gambling in sports, ethically I see it's a problem. When we look at the research studies, the findings tell us that whenever those people spend HK$1 on gambling, the government at the end needs to spend HK$4 to treat [addicted] gamblers. So for the long term, we will suffer," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday confirmed that changes are planned to the city's subsidised public transport fares for the over 60s, dubbing the new arrangement "HK$2 flat rate cum 80 percent discount".
<br>
<br/>
Journeys will still cost HK$2 in many cases, but for those that come with standard fares of HK$10 or more, only a discount of 80 percent will be provided.
<br/>
<br/>
Another change means the number of subsidised trips per month will be capped at 240, which works out at an average of roughly eight per day.
<br/>
<br/>
"This fine-tuned proposal preserves our policy intent while striking a balance between enhancing the sustainability of the scheme and minimising the impacts to the beneficiaries," Chan said in his budget address.
<br/>
<br/>
Government sources said the new arrangements are expected to come into force in September 2026.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the city's Public Transport Fare Subsidy Scheme – which covers people of all ages – is also being made less generous.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of people getting back a third of their monthly travel expenses above HK$400, from June the subsidy will only kick in from HK$500. The subsidy cap will remain at HK$400 per month.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said the changes to the two schemes will save the taxpayer HK$6.2 billion in the coming five years.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The government will not sell any commercial sites in the coming year due to a sluggish commercial property market.
<br>
<br/>
"In view of the high vacancy rates of offices in recent years and the relatively ample supply in the next few years, the government will not roll out any commercial site for sale in the coming year to allow the market to absorb the existing supply," Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in his budget speech on Wednesday.
<br/>
<br/>
As for residential sites, Chan said the 2025-26 land sale list comprises eight plots.
<br/>
<br/>
Along with other property projects, it's expected to generate about 13,700 units.
<br/>
<br/>
"The government will closely monitor market situation and development, and roll out sites in a paced and orderly manner," Chan said.
<br/>
<br/>
He added that the government will prepare land for the production of 80,000 private units in the next five years, with about 65 percent of the plots coming from the Northern Metropolis and Tung Chung New Town Extension.
<br/>
<br/>
On public housing supply, Chan said the government has identified enough land to meet the supply target of 308,000 flats over the next 10 years.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan said containing government spending would be a top priority for the administration in the coming years as he outlined plans for job cuts, pay freezes and reducing expenditure.
<br>
<br/>
Chan said he had instructed all bureaux and departments to review their resource allocation and work priorities, and provide public services in a more cost-effective manner by consolidating internal resources, streamlining procedures and leveraging technology.
<br/>
<br/>
These moves would lay a "sustainable fiscal foundation for future development", he said, with the government facing a deficit of HK$87.2 billion.
<br/>
<br/>
The finance chief said that in the coming financial year, the government would implement pay freezes for civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary as well as those serving in the legislative and district councils.
<br/>
<br/>
Among the cost cutting measures, Chan proposed the rate of reduction of recurrent government expenditure would be increased from the original one percent to two percent in the 2025‑26 financial year.
<br/>
<br/>
This arrangement would be extended for two more years to the 2027‑28 financial year.
<br/>
<br/>
Taking into account the one percent cut unveiled for the current financial year, the cumulative rate of reduction would be seven percent in total.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said this would deliver a saving in recurrent government expenditure of around HK$62 billion in the coming financial years up to 2028.
<br/>
<br/>
The financial secretary also said the civil service would be reduced by two percent annually between the 2026-27 and 2027-28 financial years, resulting in about 10,000 jobs cut by April 1, 2027.
<br/>
<br/>
The cuts in spending will also affect the education sector.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said the government would provide HK$68.1 billion to University Grants Committee-funded universities in the coming three years.
<br/>
<br/>
This funding has reflected a two percent reduction target each year, which was in line with the magnitude of government's recurrent expenditure cut.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
Financial Secretary Paul Chan proposed in his budget blueprint on Wednesday an increase in air passenger departure tax and certain government fees and charges to help generate revenue, amid a budget deficit.
<br>
<br/>
The departure tax for air passengers will go up from HK$120 to HK$200 from the third quarter of the 2025-26 financial year, with Chan saying "the impact on air passengers is expected to be minimal".
<br/>
<br/>
This will generate HK$1.6 billion in revenue to the government each year.
<br/>
<br/>
The finance chief also said transport officials will review the tolls of tunnels and major expressways in the city, and explore charging private vehicles travelling via land boundary control points.
<br/>
<br/>
"The government has cancelled the tolls of some major tunnels and strategic routes three years ago and the tolls of some government tunnels have not been adjusted for over 30 years," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
Private vehicles departing the land borders may be subject to a levy, which Chan expects to generate HK$1 billion each year, assuming a fee of HK$200 per car.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Transport and Logistics Bureau will review annual licence fees for electric vehicles, parking metre charges and fixed penalties for traffic offences.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan also said there'll be a HK$600 application fee for various talent and capital investor admission schemes with immediate effect.
<br/>
<br/>
The visa fees will be raised to HK$600 or HK$1,300 "based on the duration of limit of stay", and expected to generate HK$620 million each year.
<br/>
<br/>
"For some time in the past, some government fees and charges have not been adjusted in accordance with the established mechanisms. As a result, these fees and charges are not pegged to their costs and fail to reflect the 'user pays' principle," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
Efforts to contain government spending didn't stop Financial Secretary Paul Chan from sprinkling some sweeteners into the budget announced on Wednesday, but his offerings were slimmed down this time around.
<br>
<br/>
The familiar 100 percent reduction in salaries tax or tax under personal assessment will be provided once again, but this time with a cap of HK$1,500. That's half last year's HK$3,000 ceiling, which itself was half the previous year's HK$6,000.
<br/>
<br/>
There's also a reduction in profits tax for the current financial year but the cap is being halved as well, also to HK$1,500.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan said more than 2.1 million taxpayers and over 165,000 businesses will benefit from these two relief measures which will take a HK$3.1 billion bite out of government revenue.
<br/>
<br/>
Homeowners, meanwhile, will get a rates concession of up to HK$500 for the first quarter of 2025/26, as will owners of non-domestic properties. Last time, it was HK$1,000.
<br/>
<br/>
An extra dose of cash for social security recipients has also survived the budget constraints and is unchanged from last year, with an additional half-month payment of regular allowances, including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance payments, Old Age Allowance, Disability Allowance and Working Family Allowance.
<br/>
<br/>
Chan also had some good news for people planning to buy property.
<br/>
<br/>
"To ease the burden on buyers of residential and non‑residential properties at lower values, I announce that the maximum value of properties chargeable to a stamp duty of HK$100 will be raised from HK$3 million to HK$4 million with immediate effect," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
This year's budget sweeteners amount to HK$8.3 billion in total, down from HK$11.5 billion last year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
The number of births in South Korea rose last year for the first time in roughly a decade on the back of a rise in marriages, officials said on Wednesday, bucking a trend for a country battling a demographic crisis.
<br>
<br/>
South Korea has one of the world's longest life expectancies and lowest birth rates -- a combination that presents a looming demographic challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
Seoul has poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.
<br/>
<br/>
The crude birth rate -- the number of babies born per 1,000 people -- was 4.7, interrupting a continuous downward trend since 2014, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea.
<br/>
<br/>
And the fertility rate, or the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime, was 0.75, "up 0.03 from 0.72 in 2023", it said.
<br/>
<br/>
"The number of births in 2024 was 238,300, an increase of 8,300 (3.6 percent) from the previous year," the report added.
<br/>
<br/>
Park Hyun-jeong, an official from Statistics Korea, attributed the rise to an increase in marriages as well as shifting demographics.
<br/>
<br/>
"The population has seen a significant increase in the number of people in their early 30s," she told a press conference.
<br/>
<br/>
"This has had a major impact," Park explained.
<br/>
<br/>
"Additionally, many marriages that were delayed due to Covid-19 have now taken place, and this upward trend continues."
<br/>
<br/>
Park said the number of marriages last year had been the most since 1996 -- "the highest on record".
<br/>
<br/>
The average maternal age at childbirth in 2024 was 33.7 years, Seoul said, one of the highest in the world.
<br/>
<br/>
But the fertility rate remains far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain South Korea's population of 51 million.
<br/>
<br/>
At current rates, the population will nearly halve to 26.8 million by 2100, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. (AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
Chilean authorities said they had restored power to most homes on Wednesday, hours after a massive, rare blackout caused transport chaos in the capital and forced the president to declare a state of emergency and curfew across much of the country.
<br>
<br/>
Chile's worst blackout in well over a decade struck on Tuesday afternoon, leaving millions without power.
<br/>
<br/>
President Gabriel Boric blamed private companies that manage the grid for the system's failure.
<br/>
<br/>
"This is outrageous! The daily life of millions of Chileans can't be impacted like this by companies that don't do their job," Boric said in a statement issued by his office.
<br/>
<br/>
Early Wednesday, "90 percent of (electricity) consumption was restored" to homes, the power system's operator said in a statement.
<br/>
<br/>
According to the Senapred disaster response agency, the outage affected an area stretching all the way from Arica in the long, narrow South American country's north to Los Lagos in the south -- an area home to over 90 percent of Chile's 20 million people.
<br/>
<br/>
The blackout disrupted transport in the capital Santiago, where thousands were evacuated from the metro and people jostled to board overflowing buses.
<br/>
<br/>
President Boric had activated "a state of emergency due to a catastrophe" and announced a curfew until 6am Wednesday.

Interior Minister Carolina Toha ruled out sabotage as the reason for the power loss, which began at 3.16pm in the middle of the southern hemisphere summer.
<br/>
<br/>
"There is no reason to assume that this is an attack," she said on Tuesday, telling reporters it was more likely "a failure in the system's operation".

The metro company, which transports 2.3 million passengers every day, said workers were deployed to all stations "to support safe evacuations."

Out-of-service traffic lights caused major gridlock, with some people having to walk for hours under a hot sun to reach their homes. (AFP)

Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Wednesday said she supported the government's decision to freeze public servants' pay.
<br>
<br/>
This includes civil servants, executive authorities, members of the judiciary, legislators and district councillors.
<br/>
<br/>
She noted it would be up to the chief executive to decide whether or not to cut the salary of fellow Exco members, or even donate their salary.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think freezing public servants' pay, including our pay, legislators' pay, is the best option forward in the present circumstances," she said.
<br/>
<br/>
"Cut backs will have ripple effects on the private sector and it will affect the labour sector as well."
<br/>
<br/>
Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced in his budget that two percent of the civil service would be cut annually between the 2026/27 and 2027/28 financial years, but Ip believes the move will not affect government efficiency.
<br/>
<br/>
Felix Yip, associate director of the centre for human resources strategy and development at Baptist University, said slashing 10,000 civil service posts by April 2027 is reasonable, given advances in AI.
<br/>
<br/>
"I guess those jobs may be coming from those administrative positions... We are not talking about effectiveness, but talking about efficiency. They can gain a lot from the application of AI," Yip said.
<br/>
<br/>
"So in that regard, to a certain extent, the cost can be minimal."

Lawmaker and Lingnan University's associate vice president Lau Chi-pang on Wednesday said he believed universities could cope with the proposed funding cuts which he described as "mild and acceptable".
<br>
<br/>
In his budget speech, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he would set aside HK$68.1 billion for government-funded universities over the next three years, which reflect a two percent reduction each year.
<br/>
<br/>
The government said the funding cut could save around HK$2.8 billion for the 2025-28 triennium.
<br/>
<br/>
Lau told RTHK that universities had been preparing for the reduction and could absorb it without scaling down teaching or administrative staff.
<br/>
<br/>
"It is acceptable in a way that we do have reserves for research, development, and other expenses. So this two percent, if it's only a triennium cut, I would say that the university community can absorb that," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
However, he noted the city's universities were expanding and competing globally, which requires substantial funding.
<br/>
<br/>
Universities will also have to return HK$4 billion from their General and Development Reserve Fund to the government on a one-off basis, the University Grants Committee said in a statement.
<br/>
<br/>
Lau said while this is not good news, institutions were developing income sources including self-funded postgraduate programmes to help balance the funding cuts.
<br/>
<br/>
"Of course, we don't welcome any cut because universities are expanding our scope and we are competing with other world-class universities in the ranking, and we are helping our country to build up an even stronger higher education community," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
On the scrapping of the HK$2,500 student grant from the 2025-26 academic year, Lau believed the impact on low-income pupils would be minimal.
<br/>
<br/>
"That HK$2,500 was given to students when most students were having these online classes and they require a lot more assistance, but now we are back to a normal situation. So I don't think this is a kind of financial aid that we need to continue," he said.

Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said he hopes the public understand that everyone has to play their part when it comes to the city's "belt-tightening", given the tough financial situation.
<br>
<br/>
Chan said his budget puts forward a "reinforced version" of the fiscal consolidation programme, which includes a cumulative reduction of government recurrent expenditure by seven percent from now through 2027-28.
<br/>
<br/>
Speaking to the press, he said the government is moving in the right direction to achieve a fiscal balance.
<br/>
<br/>
"On the one hand, we try our best to diversify and grow our economy, but at the same time it is a belt-tightening budget, so everybody in the community would need to contribute to this effort," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"We are trying to do the best we can in minimising the impact on our people, but at the same time, unavoidably, everyone has to chip in a little bit."
<br/>
<br/>
The finance chief said the government has no plans at present to introduce any new taxes, such as a goods and services tax.
<br/>
<br/>
"We have to pay regard to the following considerations. One is the competitiveness of Hong Kong, in terms of attracting investment and talent. Secondly, if we are to increase revenue, we try to minimise the impact on the average citizen," Chan said.

<div class="itemFullText">
An economics professor on Wednesday said he supports proposed changes to the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme but questioned whether capping the number of journeys would offer a significant boost to the public coffers.
<br>
<br/>
The 240 monthly maximum number of trips mentioned by Financial Secretary Paul Chan in his budget works out at around eight per day on average in future.
<br/>
<br/>
Ho Lok-sang, adjunct professor of Lingnan University’s Department of Economics, said the government has good intentions in trying to cut costs.
<br/>
<br/>
But he also said very few over 60s make that many journeys, so the move won't save much for the government.
<br/>
<br/>
“I don't think capping the number of trips for the elderly makes sense. It's not going to make much effect on the revenue anyway because there are relatively few people who will travel so many times,” he told RTHK.
<br/>
<br/>
“I think there's really no point in making that kind of provision, because it makes people feel bad and it also tarnishes the government's image in terms of caring for the benefit of the well-being of the elderly.”
<br/>
<br/>
Ho added that a small number of people could be affected by the cap, such as those who need to make a lot of transfers.
<br/>
<br/>
New People's Party chairwoman Regina Ip, for her part, said she welcomes the changes to the fare scheme, which include offering an 80 percent discount for journeys that cost regular passengers HK$10 or more, rather than the current HK$2 flat rate subsidised trip.
<br/>
<br/>
"I think the government measures introduced to make it sustainable are fairly moderate," said Ip, who's also convenor of the Executive Council.
<br/>
<br/>
"(There is) no impact on the qualifying age of those benefiting from this concession, but it would help to solve the problem of paying very little fare for very long journeys."
<br/>
<br/>
DAB party vice-chairman Holden Chow also supports the changes.
<br/>
<br/>
"We believe the scheme unveiled by the (financial secretary) today is acceptable. It strikes a balance between the [need for] financial sustainability, but at the same time, will look after the needs of the elderly," he said.
<br/>
<br/>
"The people who live further away from the city centre, including people in Tuen Mun or Tung Chung, they may actually be affected. I think going forward, we will try to explore with the government and see whether there's anything we could do to alleviate the pain of these people."
