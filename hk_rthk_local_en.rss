<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praises from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey on Sunday booked a place in the women's 200m freestyle semifinals at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey came second in her heat, 0.10 secs behind China's Li Bingjie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 min 56.38 secs was the fifth fastest overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey will compete in the semifinals, early Monday Hong Kong time.

  <br/>
  Among the SAR swimmer's main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay, as well as Ariarne Titmus, fresh from winning the 400m freestyle. Titmus also holds the world and Olympic records for the women's 200m freestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m freestyle in the Tokyo Games three years ago.

 Hong Kong fencer Daphne Chan made a winning Olympic debut on Sunday at the Grand Palais in Paris, edging out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the women’s foil individual round of 32.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan scored an early point in the next round to extend her lead, but Azuma refused to go quietly, picking up a few points to tie the score at 11 at the end of the second period.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

    Crowds at Prince Edward amid partial MTR suspension

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR says there were larger-than-normal crowds at Prince Edward station. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763535_1_20240728165335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said there were larger crowds on Sunday at Prince Edward station than normal because of a partial suspension of services, but made it clear crowd-control measures were in place to facilitate travel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company suspended services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on the Kwun Tong Line to carry out large-scale tunnel asset renewal work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations – Prince Edward, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Ho Man Tin – are still being served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line, while Prince Edward is the only interchange station between the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at Yau Ma Tei station, Cheris Lee, the MTR's chief of operating and metro segment, says staff have been told to be proactive in assisting passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she believed the impact of suspension will be minimised, with the maintenance work being carried out on a Sunday during the summer vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Passengers can still use our alternative routes to all stations today," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR deployed more than 1,000 staff to facilitate operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement later in the day, the firm described the overall situation on Sunday as smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One passenger, surnamed Wong, said the suspension should have happened on a weekday, given the number of mainland tourists and foreign domestic helpers who were off on Sunday. "At least during the weekdays, there will be fewer people, at least fewer mainlanders... this (the suspension along with the rain) would create a more negative impact to Hong Kong's image," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR also reminded passengers who are travelling to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line to be 20 to 30 minutes early, to ensure they'll catch the last train.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Sunday said Hong Kong will be exploring business opportunities in emerging economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) bloc.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came as Chief Executive John Lee embarked on a visit to the Asean member states of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Yau said Hong Kong can offer professional services to these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can bring in a lot of professional services to these countries, to help their economic development. These countries have a very strong relationship with China. With this relationship, I think there are a lot of opportunities there."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the government may set up more Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) in Asean countries, in addition to the existing ones in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday began a six-day trip to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to further explore business opportunities there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Laos, Lee said he will persuade the three Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries to back Hong Kong's inclusion in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meet with local leaders to introduce Hong Kong's economic development and opportunities, and I will continue to seek their support for us to join the RCEP," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second, we will promote economic and trade exchanges in different regions. We will present Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a 'super value-adder,' showcasing what we can offer such as professional services, our experience, our connections, and how we can guide them to benefit from opportunities in Hong Kong and also enter the mainland market and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted that the combined population of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam totals around 120 million, describing them as a huge market and business prospect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's delegation includes some 30 leaders from various business and technology sectors.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the upcoming economic figures indicate sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a blog post, Chan said the government will this week unveil GDP figures for the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that both exports and investments have shown continual growth, attributed to an uptick in external demand and a surge in the nation's overall exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the finance minister expressed optimism that challenges from geopolitics will likely diminish, which will benefit investment and asset markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the stable growth of the mainland economy will provide significant support to Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that a series of exhibitions and large-scale events will bring in more tourists and consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the finance chief congratulated épée fencer Vivian Kong for securing Hong Kong's first Paris Olympics gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said Kong has showcased her exceptional skills and perseverance in her comeback victory, making all Hongkongers thrilled and excited.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing queen Vivian Kong on Sunday won the women's epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics in the most dramatic fashion, defeating local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in a fence-off.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Frenchwoman, ranked sixth in the world, started off strong, taking a 7-1 lead in the second round after taking the first 4-0, to the delight of the home crowd, including French President Emmanuel Macron, at the Grand Palais.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With momentum fully on Mallo-Breton's side, world number one Kong changed sword in an apparent attempt to regroup.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China athlete then fenced on a 9-3 run to tie the score at 10-10 in the middle of the final period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencers took the score to 12-12 for the one-minute fence off, and Kong struck first to take home the SAR's first gold medal at this year's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked what went through her mind when she clawed back from the big deficit, Kong said she didn't want to "lose ugly" and not be able to fence with "the Hong Kong spirit".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also thanked people in Hong Kong for showing support. "Thank you for staying up and watching, and I know, I'm so grateful," Kong told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm really thankful, I'm really grateful, I'm just so lucky because every [fencer] deserves it, in fencing anything can happen, I love all the girls here, I just can't believe it's me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tearful Kong also said that in the past, she was afraid of losing and got more nervous. But she now believed that, as she's worked to the best of her abilities and everyone around her has done their best to support her, she no longer had to sweat herself out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, lost in the quarter-finals in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong fencer's coach for the past nine years, Octavian Zidaru, said he thinks Kong has made amazing progress and overcame lots of injuries to reach the top of the Olympic podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Kong now has many moves and tactics at her disposal, and in the past month he's tried to just calm her nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the last month, I tried not to put any pressure on her, even in Hong Kong," Zidaru told reporters. "I told her, 'we participate in this Olympic Games like in any other competition.'"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's only the third Hong Kong gold in history and follows fellow fencer Edgar Cheung's foil victory in Tokyo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee sent his congratulations, while the sports minister, Kevin Yeung, said after watching the final in Paris that he was "touched and delighted by her performance and demeanour of a great athlete".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as Macron, spectators who saw Kong's triumph included US First Lady Jill Biden and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing queen Vivian Kong will be the first Hong Kong, China medallist of the 2024 Paris Olympics after a dramatic semi-final victory in the women's epee in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one defeated Estonia's Nelli Differt 15-11 in a nail-biting semi-final that saw the lead change hands frequently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first period started with a tight back and forth tussle that resulted in a two-all tie. That intensity continued into the second period, as the two players went neck to neck but Kong was able to move herself up on the scoreboard 8-7 by the end of that spell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong successfully widened the gap in the final round, adding seven points to pull herself into the gold medal bout.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fencing queen is the second person from the SAR to win a fencing medal after Tokyo champion Edgar Cheung, and the first in the epee discipline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The gold or silver will be Hong Kong first ever medal in women's fencing. She'll face local favourite Auriane Mallo-Breton in the final at 3.30am, Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting advanced to the last eight in the mixed doubles event, defeating their Hungarian opponents 4-1 in their opening match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo jumped out to a 2-0 lead, before Dora Madarasz and Nandor Ecseki clawed a game back 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hungarians lost the fourth game 11-6 as the SAR duo stormed their way to take the final game 11-8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our belief never wavered. We hope we can play every point well. And in the end, we managed to do that," Wong told reporters in the post-match interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair will face Maria Xiao and Alvaro Robles from Spain in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong gymnast Stone Shek was unable to make it to the final round in vault, finishing 12th in the qualifying round with eight athletes making the cut.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He miscued his first jump after landing on his feet and needed to use his hands to regain his balance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shek, who was making his third Olympic appearance after London and Tokyo, ended up with a score of 14.099.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite not advancing further, the gymnast, 32, said Paris was a very good experience which he found to be the most enjoyable and pressure free in his 20 odd years in the sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because vault after all is a little bit like gambling. No matter how good you do during practice, when you can't make the move during the competition, you can't," Shek told reporters.

 Hong Kong's world number one fencer, Vivian Kong, is another step closer to reaching the Olympic podium, after sweeping Ukraine's Olena Kryvytska in the quarter-finals of the women's individual epee on Saturday at the Grand Palais.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong started the first round with a strong 3-0 lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian was able to come back with four points, but the SAR fencing star fought back hard to finish the second period 9-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong then eased her way into the final four with six additional points in the final round to win 15-7, making this bout her best performance so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Competition now moves onto the podium piste for the beginning of the semi-finals, where Kong will take on Nelli Differt, the 12th-ranked fencer from Estonia, in the semi-final at 1am Hong Kong time.

 Hong Kong badminton stars Tse Ying-suet and Jordan Tang made a triumphant start to the Paris Olympics on Saturday, defeating their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in their mixed doubles opener.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pair from the SAR beat Lee Chia-hsin and Ye Hong-wei 21-13, 21-13 in their Group C game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse and Tang will next play Japan's pair of Arisa Higashino and Yuta Watanabe, whom they lost to in the bronze medal match at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three duos are fighting for two spots in the knockout stages. A Danish pair who would've also competed in the group withdrew from the Games earlier this month after one of them had issues reporting his whereabouts in line with anti-doping regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also on the badminton courts, Hong Kong's women's double pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Nga-lam suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Bulgaria's Gabriela Stoeva and Stefani Stoeva.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bulgarians won 21-11, 21-23 and 21-15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong pair are next in action against the Americans Annie Xu and Kerry Xu on Monday.

 Fencing queen Vivian Kong on Saturday advanced to the quarterfinals of the women's epee individual event, after defeating the United States’ Hadley Husisian 15-12 in the group of 16 match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The world number one ended the first round with a strong 3-1 lead. Kong then widened the gap further in the second period earning five points to bring the score to 8-3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two then were locked in a back and forth contest at the start of the final round, but Kong ultimately advanced to the last eight by bringing in three more points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong had reached the quarterfinals during the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong judoka Wong Ka-lee on Saturday bowed out from the Olympics, losing 10-0 to Austrian Katharina Tanzer.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong was eliminated in the women’s 48-kilogramme competition by Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she was disappointed with her performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I could have performed better, because I thought I had a chance after the draw. I hope I could do better next time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to thank [my coach and my younger brother] for encouraging me all the time... I was very nervous before the match, but they tried to help me relax."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was competing in the Games for the first time and marked the return of a Hong Kong judoka in the Olympics after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the quartet of Camille Cheng, Stephanie Au, Karen Tam and Natalie Kan, came second last in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay with a time of 3 minutes and 42.42 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team remained in last place for most of the race, before overcoming Ireland to claim seventh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au – who's taking part in her fifth Olympics – said the team had put in "100 percent of hard work" to prepare for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On competing in the future, the swimmer said: "I just wanted to swim well this time, simply focus on doing well in the competition, and think about the rest later."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds on Saturday flocked to shopping malls to catch the livestream of the first day of action at the Paris Olympics Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At Kwun Tong's apm shopping mall, a woman surnamed Tong said she became more interested in the Games since fencer Edgar Cheung won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also had a message for epee fencer Vivian Kong, who competes on Saturday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We Hongkongers support Hongkongers. I think she's really into fencing and participating in the Olympics is something she wants to achieve. I hope she has a good result and a good [experience]." she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A boy surnamed Auyeung, who had just participated in a swimming competition near the mall, said he is really excited about Siobhan Haughey competing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because she swims really fast… I hope to become a swimmer one day as well,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties said many people had gathered at the mall to support their favourite athletes, even before the SAR squad’s events took place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said she expects foot traffic and business at the mall to increase by 10 to 15 percent year-on-year over the next two days, adding that the mall will offer various discounts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said the mall plans to broadcast the games from 11am to 11pm.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Saturday narrowly missed out on qualifying for the next round at the Paris Olympics, but moves on to the repechage for another chance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two-time Olympian finished second-last in his men's single sculls heat, clocking a time of 7:00.29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said he was satisfied with his performance, which he described as "above-average".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finishing in seven minutes is a rather good time. I had the fastest time [going into the repechage] out of all six heats, so I hope I could perform like this again in the repechage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it's a pity that I was so close yet so far, and missed the quarter-finals by one spot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu, who is the first SAR athlete to compete in the Paris Games, will next compete in Sunday's repechage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Saturday said there were at least two cases of flooding in Hong Kong after the Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued in the morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said it has so far confirmed two flooding cases for the day. One of them was at the junction of Sau Mau Ping Road and Hip Wo Street, near United Christian Hospital, which has since been cleaned up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two women aged 26 and 59, sustained injuries to their limbs after slipping at the scene. They were both sent to hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second case of flooding occurred at Shau Kei Wan Main Street East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department also deployed over 40 emergency teams to inspect flooding blackspots throughout the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued on Saturday morning at 9am and was in effect until 12.50pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several districts recorded over 30mm of rainfall in the morning, while the eastern part of the territory recorded more than 40mm of rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The downpour came as an active southwest monsoon brought showers and thunderstorms to the coast of Guangdong and the northern part of the South China Sea.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Animal rescue organisations on Saturday said rapid land development in Hung Shui Kiu and Kwu Tung has resulted in a significant rise in stray and abandoned dogs, creating a strain on overcrowded shelters and posing public health risks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Paws Guardian Rescue Shelter volunteer Kent Luk said that there has been an influx in animal abandonment in the past six months due to an increase in land resumption projects in the North District, noting that the shelter currently has over 300 stray dogs and 150 cats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB called for government support and the implementation of long-term, large-scale animal shelters that provide more adoption, medical care and animal welfare services to reduce the number of strays on the streets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The running cost of a shelter in Hong Kong is so high, including the cost of land and labour costs... that is why we recommend the government provide more financial support," said District Councillor Corey Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau spoke about the importance of balancing urban development with the need to protect animal rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to balance development with animal rights because we think that animal rights will also effect the lives of humans," he added.

    Digital Policy Office to help SMEs adopt technology

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Digital Policy Commissioner Tony Wong on Saturday said the newly established Digital Policy Office will aim to help small and medium sized firms (SMEs) adopt new tech to boost competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong said the office, which is under the Innovation, Technology & Industry Bureau, has three major focus areas, including developing technology-related policies, creating a digital government, and promoting the use of technology in public services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He mentioned that HK$500 million has been earmarked for a digital transition pilot scheme for SMEs in Cyberport. The office will first subsidise the retail and catering sectors to digitalise their operations by installing customer management, marketing, and electronic payment systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The main purpose is to help SMEs learn how to apply basic technology or applications. These applications don't require any changes; they are like items on a supermarket shelf – you can pick and use them immediately,” he said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The two industries often interact with many residents and tourists. By starting with them, we believe we will see results quickly. They also frequently encounter pain points and difficulties, such as a lack of manpower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also spoke on the recent incident where Microsoft experienced a failure in updating its antivirus system, wreaking havoc on firms around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that while the government’s system was not affected by the incident, it indicates the importance of having backup systems and a reminder for all government departments to conduct regular tests.

    'Cross-border organ transfer should be regularised'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The health minister said on Saturday the administration is currently in discussion with mainland authorities to streamline cross-border organ transfer arrangements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the Hong Kong Children's Hospital received a cord blood unit from Guangzhou on Thursday to treat a five-year-old girl who suffers from thalassaemia. The patient could undergo surgery in October at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo Chung-mau said on a Commercial Radio programme that the Health Bureau hopes to eliminate the procedure of having to file an application with mainland authorities and await approval for each cross-boundary organ transplant case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a short amount of time is available when organ transplant is needed [to save a patient]. Regularisation of organ transfer arrangements can help patients find a suitable organ quickly. It would be best if authorities of two regions can notify the other whenever there is no suitable organ recipients in their area," Lo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the health chief noted that the difference in immigration control regulations on organs poses a challenge towards the regularisation process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lo said the government will further develop the SAR's rare disease centre by collaborating with the mainland, so children with diseases in Hong Kong can be given the best treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a rare disease centre in the Children's Hospital with the expertise, the geneticists, and also clinicians who are experts in these genetic disease... in collaboration with the mainland we are developing a rare disease centre, so hopefully in the future our babies and kids with diseases, they will be given the best of care," he said.

    Govt to revise subsidised flat scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho on Saturday said the government will look into ways to revise a pilot scheme that lets developers take on the role of building subsidised housing flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after the administration rejected a tender for a residential site in Chai Wan earlier this week, after only one bid, which failed to meet the government's reserve price, was received.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Cheung Man Road site is earmarked for at least 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value – with any unsold units to be kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, the housing minister said the administration is open to suggestions from the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest rate wasn't lowered as expected so developers feel it's very difficult after doing their calculations. For other terms and conditions our industry friends and professional associations can give us some advice. We will take them as a reference. We have other land to choose from, such as different locations, ground area, or unit numbers. That might make a difference. Give us some time to study this," she said.

  The government is tendering three sites for development under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme, which was announced last year to boost supply of subsidised homes by working with private developers.

 A group of students and teachers from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) are on a two-week trip to Rwanda to serve the local community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  PolyU's Council Chairman Lam Tai-fai, President Jin-guang Teng and Vice President Ben Young also joined the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Department of Computing ventured into rural Rwandan villages to install over 400 solar power systems, bringing electricity to underprivileged households in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, students from the School of Fashion and Textiles brought their expertise to local communities, teaching specialist skills in the textile arts. Their aim is to train villagers to transform fabric into sustainable clothing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Friday said Hong Kong should leverage its unique advantages to promote new quality productive forces.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at a seminar on new quality productive forces, Chan said Hong Kong needs to work with other cities in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Firstly, we should actively make good use of Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial hub to strengthen all-round capital support for new quality productive forces. Secondly, it's to attract professionals and firms to here," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thirdly, we need to enhance our cooperation with the brother cities in the Greater Bay Area. That will definitely inject momentum into new quality productive forces and high quality development in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event, Dean of the Institute of Contemporary China Studies of Tsinghua University, Hu Angang, said Hong Kong has an increasingly important role to play in the nation's economic modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to transfer the manufacturing sector from the developed areas near the coast towards the mid-west part area, forming a big domestic cycle. But most importantly, we need to encourage local firms, especially manufacturers, to invest and move overseas, forming a so-called international big cycle," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the main strategy of China's economic modernisation. It is not a single cycle, but two inter-related cycles. The role and status of Hong Kong will not be lowered, but will continue to grow. "
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hu added that the Chinese economy has been growing rapidly and predicted gross domestic product per capita to exceed US$30,000 by 2035.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday appealed to the entire city to rally behind Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the CE highlighted the continued emergence of new talent, adding that he believed all athletes would give their best on the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 35 athletes from Hong Kong, China, will be competing in 13 sports at the upcoming Olympic Games, with more than half of them making their Olympic debut. This not only marks the passing of the torch of Hong Kong sports to the new generation, but also highlights the emergence of new talent in the field," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government has secured the television rights for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These events will be broadcast live on four free-to-air television channels and screened at designated sports centres in all 18 districts, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Calling for a citywide celebration, Lee urged everyone to unite in cheering on Hong Kong's Olympic athletes.

    Animation-Comic-Game fair begins

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Animation-Comic-Game fair opened its doors on Friday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763285_1_20240726164608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Animation-Comic-Game fair began on Friday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, with hundreds queuing before the doors opened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Over 2,000 cosplayers are expected to join the five-day event, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Ho, who was at the front of the queue, said he hoped to buy his favourite toys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I started queuing at around 7, as first place tickets require us to be here from 7 to 7.50, so I don’t want to be late. I’m here to buy deadpool toys for my friend, and I’ll take a look at figures and toys. I am expecting to spend around HK$7,000 to HK$8,000,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Lam, whose stall features Inside Out 2 merchandise, said the expectation was that 80 percent of goods would be sold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An exhibitor surnamed Cheng was also optimistic about sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The highlight product will be the plushie from Chikawa, they all are from Japan, they are all very famous in Hong Kong, China and Japan. We also have Mofusand, a very famous IP character in Hong Kong. We hope we can have around HK$1 million in sales,” Cheng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ryan Chung was in the exhibition area, dressed as Kaedehara Kazuha from Genshin Impact. He said he had seen more cosplayers this year, but he had a complaint about the ticket arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The arrangement this year is more complicated. I’m a cosplayer and I have to buy another ticket to get into the cosplayer zone. [It is] somehow too much, but at the same time, it provides a more quiet space for cosplayers and photographers to take pictures, which is a more professional approach,” Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nelson Woo, who was dressed as Monster 8 from Kaiju No. 8, was also unhappy with the two separate areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[This year] is the worst. Hall 3 needs to pay [to enter], but [tickets are] only for 2,500 cosplayers. It is too low, [and the organiser] doesn't have any more tickets [for cosplayers]. Last year Hall 3 was free and it was very nice,” Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the venue, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong chief executive officer Leung Chung-pun said the visitor flow was similar to that of previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that organisers aim to provide a pleasant venue for cosplayers to participate in the yearly event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “My major concern is the welfare of the cosplayers. The atmosphere is not my major concern, as long as cosplayers have a good environment to enjoy their time here, I am happy,” Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event will run until July 30.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB says it will organise a series of events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, including screening patriotic movies and offering free Chinese medicine services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photography competition will enable participants to express how they “love and treasure our home and country” through their work. The winning entries will be showcased in an exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party will also host various technology-related exhibitions in shopping malls across Hong Kong, including one showcasing China-produced electric cars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a poster design competition for secondary students with the theme of “showcasing China's achievements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will utilise our district network advantage to organise the events,” the party’s chairman Gary Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope every district in Hong Kong can feel the celebratory atmosphere of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB said it will also hold a short video contest to gather tourism ideas that show "the other side of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the contest is not just a celebratory event, but also a response to the concept of “tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong" as expressed by the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Xia Baolong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lawmaker said he believes Hong Kong locals are best positioned to identify unique tourism spots within the city.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs on Friday said they arrested 18 people this month on suspicion of allowing party room and restaurant customers to stream karaoke songs in breach of copyright laws.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided 31 party rooms and one restaurant between July 2 and 25, seizing karaoke song players and four gaming devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Divisional commander for intellectual property technology crime investigation, Shek Ka-yin, said it is the first time customs has cracked down on people allegedly offering karaoke songs via online streaming platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional cases, party rooms or restaurants are installed with karaoke players preloaded with infringing karaoke songs," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this case, instead, infringing karaoke songs which were preloaded in the karaoke devices were put in a data centre, which used the streaming technology to transfer the infringing karaoke songs to the subject party rooms for use by the customers," Shek alleged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs said two people were charged with infringing copyright and violation of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, while the remaining 16 were released on bail.

    Business leaders have high hopes for Asean trip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Business leaders who will be part of an SAR delegation travelling with Chief Executive John Lee to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam this month say they hope Hong Kong can strengthen ties with the Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Agnes Chan, who chairs the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said professional services the SAR offers are in demand in many Asean countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Vietnam lacks skilled labour and Hong Kong companies can help them with skill training. As for Laos, I think its infrastructure is lagging behind and needs Hong Kong's expertise in infrastructure development,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that she hopes to secure tax incentives for Hong Kong businesses in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already established a bilateral tax agreement with Vietnam and Cambodia, but we haven’t secured that with Laos. I am eager to see if there will be further progress,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Chuang, the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, said a survey found that 45 percent of its 120 members operate in Asean countries, with the majority in Vietnam, a small number in Cambodia and just one in Laos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is a good time to visit Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, given the many business opportunities offered in these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There have been more factories setting up in Cambodia in recent years. The country also has a young population with strong purchasing power,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I also hope to take this opportunity to understand more about Laos. It is a relatively new market and there’s a new railway connecting its capital Vientiane and Kunming. This is the first major cross-border railway connecting China and an Asean country, which has brought Laos loads of people, logistics and capital.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chuang added that large companies in Vietnam can make use of Hong Kong’s role as an international finance centre to raise money.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced on Friday that he has reappointed Eddie Yue as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chan praised Yue's leadership, highlighting the authority's success in maintaining local monetary and banking stability amid challenges in recent years including black-clad violence and the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that Eddie will continue to lead the HKMA effectively in the coming five years and make further contributions to Hong Kong's financial, economic and social progress," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yue expressed gratitude for the finance minister's trust, adding that he will strive to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment, the international financial landscape, and geopolitics are likely to remain complex and uncertain for some time," Yue said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that consolidating and expanding Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre is the best way for us to contribute to the prosperity of our country and Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yue's new five-year term is set to commence on October 1.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has told the visiting Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba that the spirit of the rule of law is highly respected in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive's Office said during a meeting on Wednesday, the SAR leader spoke about the territory's current economic situation, business opportunities and market potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that the SAR government would adopt necessary measures to ensure the safety of people in Hong Kong, adding that all its actions abide strictly with local laws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Kuleba had called on Lee to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong as a way to circumvent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow for its war in Ukraine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kuleba travelled to Hong Kong following more than three hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Guangzhou on Wednesday, which focused on ways to put an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine. (Additional reporting by agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Exhibitors at the media preview for Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong on Thursday said they expect an increase in sales this year, as the fair coincides with the release of this summer's Hollywood blockbusters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event runs for five days from Friday, about the same time as the premiere of "Deadpool & Wolverine" and Disney's "Inside Out 2" in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 142 exhibitors will participate in the event. One of them, Chow, whose stall featured a statue of Deadpool, along with figures, hats, stickers and plushies, said they expect a 30 percent jump in sales this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another stall owner, Ho, told RTHK they will roll out products related to the Transformers franchise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the 40th anniversary for Transformers so we have some highlighted products for Transformers. Also for Marvel, this year is the 85th anniversary for Marvel Comics, so we also have a list of products to sell at this event," Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cosplayers dressed as Iron Man, the Hulk, and Jedi from the Star Wars franchise were also enjoying the atmosphere at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai as they posed for pictures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets are priced at HK$42 for adults and HK$20 for children aged 3 to 11. Visitors are required to purchase their tickets via the organiser’s mobile application or at convenience stores.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over-the-counter tickets will only be available to international tourists.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Preterm births and malnutrition in children have increased in Gaza due to worsening conditions over the past nine months, according to a Hong Kong nurse and midwife who has been on the ground with the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Krystal So, who recently returned from a month in Gaza, said she encountered dire conditions including overwhelming patient numbers, supply shortages and unsafe conditions for pregnant women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can imagine running a hospital, we need a lot of specific medical supplies, for example, what we wear, what we use for medication. The most urgent need is water and fuel," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So said many healthcare centres had been destroyed by airstrikes which led to an overwhelming influx of patients on a daily basis at the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where she worked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that Gaza's sealed borders prevented essential medical and daily necessities from reaching hospitals.

    'Higher risk if parent has bipolar disorder'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at Chinese University said a study pointed to children more likely to have bipolar disorder, if their parents also have the condition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Findings from the study carried out with the help of 10 hospitals in the Greater Bay Area showed that the risk doubled for children with one or both parents having bipolar disorder, compared with others whose parents don't have the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study also found that the risk of circadian dysfunction is four times higher for teenagers with one or both parents with bipolar disorder, and 7.5 times higher of having symptoms of social anxiety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The researchers said this was because these teenagers have significantly lower-than-usual levels of melatonin, which helps with sleep.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said their findings form a roadmap of bipolar disorder symptoms which can help with treatment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Wing Yun-kwok, who heads the Department of Psychiatry at the university, said people with mental illnesses need to learn to live with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think mental illness or bipolar disorder is just like diabetes, blood hypertension, cancer. There's no difference. When you have too high blood glucose, that's diabetes. Too much blood pressure is blood hypertension. So you have too much swing in moods, actually it's bipolar," Wing said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union on Thursday said it has received requests for help from over 500 workers on more than 10 projects, involving some HK$30 million in unpaid wages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The union called on the Labour Department to establish a working group to settle the disputes as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also warned there could be more disputes over pay in the construction industry as the economy slows and there are fewer private projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union said there is a long-standing problem with contractors not paying on time, which causes delays and cash flow problems for subcontractors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biggest problem is what leads to the workers' wages being owed, which is subcontractors not receiving payment. There are many reasons behind subcontractors not receiving payment. It could be about the construction progress; or there are some challenging contracts, which defer payment for two months; or even worse to deliberately be picky on their work, then delaying the subcontractors’ fund for business and wages," said the union's chairman Chau Sze-kit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union also urged the Legislative Council to quickly pass the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to protect workers.

    Cross-border cord blood arrives at Children's Hospital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Doctors at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital say a five-year-old girl with severe thalassaemia will undergo stem cell transplant surgery in October using umbilical cord blood transferred from the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure can cure the condition and abolish the need for the patient to have a blood donation every four to five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During a media briefing on Thursday, the hospital said the blood came from the girl’s younger brother and was moved to Hong Kong last week from a cell bank in Guangzhou.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Cheuk Ka-leung, a consultant at the hospital’s department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine, said checks have been conducted to make sure the blood is a match for the girl and safe to use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have proceeded to type the brother's white blood cells to see whether this brother's white blood cells match with the patient and we found that it really matches,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We initiated a lot of communications. We make sure that the quality and the results of testing of the cord blood match our standard and then we proceed to arrange for all the procedures, all the paperwork to get the permit to transport the cord blood to Hong Kong.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that the hospital usually searches for cord blood that matches the patient on a local database organised by the Hong Kong Red Cross, but decided to accept a cross-border donation for the first time as sibling donors are always preferred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital said there are currently 10 patients on its waiting list for stem cell surgery.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A dumper truck driver died on Thursday after being pinned between his vehicle and an excavator.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident happened at around 9am at a construction site in the Highland Park housing estate in Lai King.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police are investigating the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, a representative of the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, said it's believed that the 42-year-old driver was standing behind his vehicle when a moving part of the excavator pushed him down.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu stressed the need for machinery to be equipped with sensors that stop operation in emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Sze-kit, chairman of the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, noted a recent increase in industrial accidents and urged site managers to make worker safety a priority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen a lot of accidents in the past because sites were not well managed and projects were rushed. Safety was ignored because of negligence or deadlines. We urge employers and contractors to always make safety a priority, no matter how urgent the project," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said it is highly concerned about the accident and expressed its deepest sympathy to the man’s family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had deployed staff to conduct on-site investigations as well as issuing suspension notices to the contractors involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation," the department said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court on Thursday ruled that Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai has a case to answer in his national security trial.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He is on trial facing three charges of conspiracy and sedition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defence had sought to dismiss the case, citing insufficient evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the court rejected the bid by the defence and said Lai has a case to answer on all charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also heard that the defendant plans to testify in the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case has been adjourned until November 20.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai has pleaded not guilty to colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to publish seditious material.

    Interest rates uncertainty blamed for tender failure

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763102_2_20240725141701.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing Secretary Winnie Ho says uncertainty over interest rates put developers off bidding for a subsidised housing plot in Chai Wan.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government on Wednesday rejected the only bid for the site on Cheung Man Road, as the tenderer failed to meet the reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plot is earmarked for at least 700 units under the Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme on Thursday, Ho said uncertainty over rate cuts affected developers' interest in the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Initially everyone thought interest rate cuts might be [made] in the middle of the year, around June. But that didn't happen. Now everyone thinks there will only be signs of a downward trend at the end of the year," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said there was no concrete timetable for putting the site out to tender again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau Chun-kong from the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors said on the same programme that the Cheung Man Road plot is in an ideal location, being as it is near an MTR station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a slope at the site would lead to additional costs, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the government could make the plot more appealing to developers if it reduced the amount of facilities they would be required to build there.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services, Nicholas Brooke, says a failed tender for a residential plot in Chai Wan on Wednesday suggested the government didn't provide sufficient incentives for developers to take on one of its subsidised housing projects.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tender for the Cheung Man Road site was withdrawn after only one bid was received and it failed to meet the reserve price. It involved 700 units with the government setting the price at 65 percent of the market value - with any unsold units being kept by the developer to sell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Honestly, it's not really a developer-type opportunity," said Brooke, who was speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's more a construction play and if they want to involve the development community then there has got to be more incentive. And I think that that incentive would mean that every scheme of this nature would have to include some private sector units as well, so the developer would be rewarded."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it wants to tender out three sites under its Private Subsidised Sale Flat Pilot Scheme. Announced last year, it is designed to complement the government's Home Ownership Scheme by bringing in private developers to boost building capacity for subsidised homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the private sector should still be involved in subsidised housing construction but that some changes may be needed from the government given the weak property market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they need to look at the backcloth and the general conditions in the market very closely before they go to tender with the next site," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The package needs revisiting if you like. We need to involve the private sector in the production of subsidised housing so the scheme is important. But I think this was a test and I hope the government will learn from that and fine-tune, if you like, the next proposal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has said it will continue to assess the market’s development, and may adjust the pilot scheme’s parameters, and future tender arrangements for sites, if such actions are found to be necessary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it would continue to encourage private developers to participate in the pilot scheme under the private land approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the scheme, land can be developed through public tendering or through the use of private land.

 The Observatory says Severe Typhoon Gaemi is moving across the Taiwan Strait and is expected to make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday, maintaining a distance of over 500 kilometres from Hong Kong. It says unless Gaemi adopts a more westerly track after making landfall, the chance of issuing a tropical cyclone warning signal is relatively low.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Observatory also says the south-west monsoon over the northern part of the South China Sea will become more active, and depending on the changes in local wind conditions, it will consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said it would consider issuing the Strong Monsoon Signal depending on the progress of Super Typhoon Gaemi, which is forecast to move across Taiwan and make landfall over Fujian later on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said on its website that Gaemi is expected to stay about 600km from Hong Kong before making landfall over Fujian.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned that Gaemi will bring strong offshore winds to Hong Kong later on Thursday and early on Friday, along with temperatures of up to 35 degrees or more in parts of the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi made landfall overnight in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said two people are dead and 201 injured. It's forced the suspension of high-speed railway service, and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes and business operations in 22 counties and cities have been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi exacerbated seasonal rains in the Philippines, triggering flooding and landslides that killed six.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first typhoon to make landfall in Taiwan this year, Gaemi was "expected to be the strongest" one in eight years, a government forecaster told AFP.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had caused downpours and strong gusts across Taiwan before its arrival, killing one motorist in southern Kaohsiung city who was crushed by a falling tree, and a woman in eastern Hualien, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 200 people were injured by Wednesday evening, while more than 290,000 homes were plunged into darkness due to power outages, disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By 8pm (1200 GMT) on Wednesday, authorities had evacuated more than 8,000 people living in precarious conditions across Taiwan, particularly in Hualien -- a mountainous area with a high risk of landslides.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trains and ferry services were suspended and hundreds of international and domestic flights were cancelled on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that the impact of the typhoon will be extended to four days (until Friday)," said Taiwan's Central Weather Administration chief Cheng Jia-ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools and offices will remain closed for the second day in a row in several cities -- including Taipei -- with authorities expecting adverse weather to continue across the island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gaemi is expected to make its way across the strait on Thursday and hit eastern Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, where authorities have issued a red storm alert.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Gaemi swept past the Philippines, intensifying monsoons that were typical this time of the year and triggering widespread flooding in Manila that turned streets into rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Landslides killed six in provinces surrounding Manila, police and disaster officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Weather authorities in Japan's southern island region of Okinawa urged residents to "exercise strong vigilance" against storms, high waves and floods. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four teenagers have been arrested after suspicious chemicals and weapons were found on a hillside near a vocational school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers on Wednesday said the four secondary school pupils, aged between 13 and 15, knew each other, with one of them being a suspected triad member. They were detained for allegedly conspiring to make explosives and possessing them, among other offences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they acted upon receiving a report from the Kwun Tong branch of the Institute of Vocational Education, adding that officers found 90 containers with suspected chemicals at the scene. Police also seized weapons and a number of laboratory equipment like beakers and alcohol burners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As for the motives of those arrested, whether it involved anything political or if they were manipulated by others, and whether there were any other accomplices besides the four, these are what the police are extremely concerned about," said senior superintendent Eileen Chung of the Kowloon East regional crime unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that suspected explosives were found in the residence of one of the suspects.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday announced that it had failed to sell a residential site in Chai Wan, after receiving only one tender.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Lands Department said it had rejected the sole bid, as it did not meet the government's reserve price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site on Cheung Man Road was the first put up for public tender under a pilot scheme for private developers to help build subsidised units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site under tender was for not less than 700 residential units, which should be sold at 65 percent of the market price, along with care homes for the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, officials said they would not speculate on why the price was not met, adding many factors, such as market conditions and company strategies, played a role.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added it would continue to provide more subsidised housing and enrich the housing ladder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also keep in view the market development, and review in due course if there is a need to adjust some of the key parameters of the Pilot Scheme as well as future tender arrangements for sites under the Pilot Scheme," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also continue to encourage private developers to participate in the Pilot Scheme under the private land approach."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, the government sold a plot in Sha Tin for HK$619 million, the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they are investigating a murder, arson and attempted suicide case in Central in which a woman died.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it received multiple reports of fire and smoke coming out of a flat on Kotewall Road at around 1pm on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After forcibly opening the door and putting out the fire, officers found a 57-year-old woman in the living room and her 66-year-old husband in the bathroom. They were taken to hospital where the woman was pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Initial investigation revealed that the man is suspected of setting the unit on fire in a suicide attempt, which led to the death of his wife who was in the same unit,” the police said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A suicide note and suspected accelerant, which are believed to be related to the case, were seized at scene.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said a post-mortem will be carried out to determine what caused the woman’s death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two firemen, meanwhile, felt unwell and were sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they had arrested 44 people in an operation targeting illegal workers and the use of e-bikes for delivery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This includes 36 non-Chinese who hold temporary identification documents which bar them from working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven account holders were also arrested for providing their accounts to the illegal workers, so that they could take orders or deliver takeaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also found that the arrested account holders come from the same place as the deliverymen, or are their friends, and that they had lent out their accounts," said Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police revealed that delivery platforms had agreed to terminate riders' accounts if workers were found to have committed illegal acts, including the use of e-bikes or seriously breaching traffic regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities also reached out to building management offices to remind security guards to register the couriers' information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said security staff should contact police immediately if the deliverymen do not have ID cards.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday unveiled details of the inaugural Hong Kong Shopping Festival which aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) expand their reach in the mainland's e-commerce market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the mainland's online retail sales hitting 15.4 trillion renminbi (US$2.12 trillion) in the past year – a year on year increase of 11 percent – the festival provides an opportunity for Hong Kong businesses to tap into the booming market, allowing SMEs to leverage extensive visitor traffic and diverse customer bases to enhance their visibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will feature over 230 brands offering discounts across categories such as apparel, food, personal care products and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKTDC Assistant Executive Director Stephen Liang said the initiative will provide SMEs with practical experience in navigating the mainland's e-commerce landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very good opportunity for [SMEs] to learn about how the mainland e-commerce operates and at the same time introduce them to more KOLs to create exposure," Liang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will take place for the entire month of August and will include large digital promotions on platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, as well as live-stream events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland e-commerce platforms, they have different ways to market their products, they use different slogans ... and different ways to drive traffic," said Liang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An Oscar-winning visual effects production company, which produced visual effects for Hollywood blockbuster films like “Titanic” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”, is establishing an AI research centre at the Hong Kong Science Park (HKSP).
 <br>
  <br/>
  Digital Domain has previously won 11 Academy Awards, including three "Best Visual Effects", and eight "Scientific and Technical Achievement" Oscars.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre's establishment ceremony on Wednesday, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong hailed the new partnership between the HKSP and Digital Domain as a "significant milestone in digital entertainment" and a huge boost to the SAR's creative sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IT minister noted that AI has transformed the way movies, animations, and visual effects were made, and believes the partnership will revolutionise the SAR's entertainment industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Digital Domain is a testament to this, with its groundbreaking use of AI technology as a tool for better storytelling and immersion. By harnessing the power of AI, we can create truly exceptional products that push the boundaries of imagination," he said.

  "This is the future we envision for the film and entertainment industry, where humans and AI work hand-in-hand to create unforgettable experiences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology minister also interacted with a lifelike AI-generated image of the late singer Teresa Teng during a demonstration session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the SAR government is well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges arising from AI and will offer all sorts of support to develop the technology in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Digital Domain’s CEO Daniel Seah said he dreams of building a “Hollywood of China” in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe we can help the Hong Kong film market...over the past 30 years we have accumulated lots of data and digital assets. All these will be used in machine learning and deep learning in the research centre at Science Park,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have the ability and resources to bring back amazing films here.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third Side on Wednesday called for Chief Executive John Lee to introduce new ways for young people to contribute to society in his policy address later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We encourage the government to open up more opportunities, and in other social activities, encourage them and give them some support and subsidy, encourage them to design some creative activities, and through social activities, engage the young people in community affairs," the party's chairman Tik Chi-yuen said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party called for vouchers for those aged 16 to 35 to buy tickets for events or to take part in cultural activities, as well as for HK$100 million to be spent each year on paying for young artists to develop businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side also called for universal suffrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Basic Law, the Central government promised direct elections for CE and Legislative Council members. We are looking for democracy in Hong Kong. This is also the responsibility of the SAR government. Like Article 23, they take up the responsibility to create the atmosphere to allow the movement of democracy in Hong Kong," Tik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that people's livelihoods, economic development and democracy complement each other.

    'More support needed for ethnic minority elderly'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKCS says more resources should be put into making mainstream care services more accessible for elderly people who come from ethnic minority groups. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762958_1_20240724150608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS) on Wednesday said more than half of ethnic minority carers lack confidence in mainstream care services, according to its survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The organisation conducted the survey from November to April this year, and collected 250 questionnaires, 200 from elderly folk and 50 from carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 10 being the highest confidence level, over half of ethnic minority carers gave only 1 to 5 to mainstream care services. Almost 90 percent of elderly and carers have never used mainstream care services which are mainly provided by the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Viola Tsang, HKSC's service head, said this was worrying especially given the population of  ethnic minority elderly people in Hong Kong was expected to increase by 160 percent, according to population census data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jackie Chan, supervisor of HKCS's Centre for Research & Development, said that among the small 10 percent who had used mainstream services, almost 30 percent said the language barrier was very problematic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This sentiment was echoed by Nanda, a 33-year-old Nepali women, who said that notices should be offered in English as well, especially for important information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang added that pre-existing translation copies were not sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More audio broadcasts or even to translate the public information into easy-to-read and simple ways in different ethnic languages is also very helpful for them to access the public service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other recommendations by HKCS include more bridging services, multicultural sensitivity training for mainstream care providers, and an ethnic minority specialised team with more ethnic minority staff.

    Hong Kong should develop e-sports: lawmakers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 C15+ lawmakers on Wednesday urged the government to develop e-sports as part of their suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices, lawmaker William Wong called on the authorities to consider giving e-sports "elite sport" status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that Hong Kong gamers secured a silver medal in an e-sports event at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing well in the Asian Games… but when we do our research, we've realised that the parents are actually undermining a little bit about the potential of the sport itself. So I think the first thing the government has to do is to change the image of e-sports and preferably, at some point in time, actually make e-sports as one of the elite sports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the gaming industry benefits the city’s economy, adding that the sector is projected to generate US$1.8 billion in income by 2027, up from US$1.4 billion in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Andrew Lam urged the CE to use Hong Kong's intangible heritage to promote tourism and boost the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I particularly mentioned about the conservation of our countryside, revitalisation of our villages. Because actually it's the best kind of real experience, apart from the very busy urban area that tourists and also our local visitors could have a deeper understanding and appreciation of our cultural origin. It's not just about Hong Kong, it's also about Chinese story," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third policy address in October.

    Lawmaker calls for longer transitional site tenancies

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Andrew Lam says many transitional housing residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762901_1_20240724095341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Andrew Lam is calling on the government to make sure transitional housing projects can remain on their sites for longer, saying many residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing, like subdivided flats, once the tenancy is up.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam made the comment after commissioning a survey of residents who had moved from inadequate housing to transitional housing. He said half of those surveyed feared returning to inadequate housing and this was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All this transitional housing is run by NGOs on temporary allocation of land. So the original policy is that this housing will cover five to a maximum of seven years," Lam said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Including the construction period... a lot of them only have three years' operation time so that's the key problem with the transitional housing arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam believes the situation is slightly better for light public housing but that a lot of these sites were a kind of charity by landowners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been promoting transitional housing development through the use of short-term vacant land and premises. In 2020, the Housing Bureau set up a scheme to support transitional housing projects by NGOs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Light public housing is more government-driven and uses both government and private land. The modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address, are also designed to house those on the public rental housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of both transitional housing and light public housing remain on the public rental housing list as before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he commissioned an independent company for his survey and that it covered 14 operating transitional housing estates. He said there were over 350 responses.

    Security beefed up in Paris ahead of Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Paris Olympics are just around the corner and authorities in France are not taking any chances on security, as the national terrorist alert remains at the highest level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police from France and dozens of other countries, alongside local security personnel, have been deployed to patrol major landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées in the days leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the Olympic opening ceremony will be held outdoors, with about 300,000 spectators expected to gather along the Seine River for the spectacular show on Friday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of their arrangements, French authorities have set up security perimetres, known as “grey zones”, near the river, and tourists will need to apply for a QR code in advance for entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The police presence around the Olympic venues and events is very strong, and implementations of the red and grey zones to block of pedestrians and vehicle traffic as they see fit. I guess they are good, even though I can’t really walk the Seine right now because I don’t have a grey pass,” American tourist Mitchell Hasenpflug told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takehiro Kinoshita, who travelled with his family from Japan to watch the skateboarding event, said he was surprised to see how clean and prepared the city is for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel all the time safe 'cause you see all the police around the corner, and it’s amazing so I cannot complain,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not everyone's amused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local resident, Dominique, said traffic is getting worse with restricted zones and an influx of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s terrible, but we didn’t have the choice either… but no, of course you have inconvenience for these Olympic Games.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some businesses located in the sealed-off areas said they too are feeling the pinch, complaining about fewer customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also said they are closing for a few days until after the opening ceremony on July 26.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) on Tuesday said 45 air-conditioners had been delivered to the Olympic village in Paris for SAR athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SF&OC said the move was made after coordination by the SAR government and the liaison office, as well as communication with the organising committee of the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation is one of several that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced that culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung will fly to Paris on Thursday to attend events at the Games and cheer for Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his stay, Yeung will meet with the SAR delegation in the Olympic village and watch competitions featuring Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will return to Hong Kong on July 31.

    People hunt for bargains on last day of Book Fair

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Hong Kong Book Fair closed on Tuesday, as sellers tried to clear stocks and readers try to hunt for bargains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ernest Kan, Deputy General Manager of Sup Retail (Hong Kong) Limited, said that sales this year were encouraging but more challenging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there are no consumption vouchers offered by the government this year, and so the pocket money of most citizens are tighter."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, Carminna of SmartKids said this year's sales were slightly higher than expected, and she thinks this was because people coming to the book fair were looking for special discounted items, which they did not offer last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Fung from iGlobe Publishing Ltd, which mainly sells travel books, said their new book focusing on Shenzhen has been popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because many people want to go to Shenzhen to play or eat every Saturday, every Sunday. So our book gives them many information on how to have more fun in Shenzhen, so many people come to book fair to buy this one (their book on Shenzhen)."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trade Development Council, which organised the event, said total visitor numbers over the past seven days reached 990,000, similar to last year's figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The book fair continued its tradition of bringing people together through literature, with seminars achieving remarkable popularity and attracting many visitors from mainland China to participate," said the council's acting executive director Sophia Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And on the final day of the book fair, buyers were taking advantage of cheaper prices, particularly with exam practice workbooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them was Miss Song, who estimated that she would spend about HK$10,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "English books here are cheaper than in book stores outside. Because my daughter usually buys English books for about HK$140, but here maybe because the books are slightly older, or they were in stock for a long time, they cost only about HK$40."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, local student Evanna said this year's bargains were not as good as last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prices in the past years were not as expensive, and there also seems to be less variety this year."
