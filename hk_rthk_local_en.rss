<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong athletes heading to the upcoming Paralympic Games have set new goals for themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR will send 23 athletes to Paris, competing in eight sports, including archery, boccia and wheelchair fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton star Daniel Chan will compete in the men’s singles, and hopes for a better result than in the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would like to finish all my competitions in a healthy way, because there are too many injuries through the years. And a medal would be another thing. In the last Paralympics, I got a bronze medal. I would like to change the colour of the medal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 39-year-old will also retire after this year’s Paralympics, and said he would miss the court and the memories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I wish I could enjoy every moment during the Paralympics and try to write down and keep all the memories,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, boccia athlete Ho Yuen-kei will play in the women’s individual and mixed pairs events in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she has high hopes as she’s an “experienced” athlete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last time in Tokyo, we [ranked] fourth, just a little bit [off from getting] a medal. So what our target is that we want to try our best and get the medal [for] Hong Kong,” Ho said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Ng Cheuk-yan secured a ticket to the Paralympics after she broke the 200m breaststroke world record at the Citi Para Swimming World Series last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 14-year-old first-time Paralympian will participate in three events, and she said she will do her best and enjoy the competition.

 Immigration officials on Friday said they had arrested three people on suspicion of working illegally in the SAR as photographers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department said it believes the trio – a man and two women – had advertised wedding and street photography services on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they pretended to be customers and arrested the three suspects after they entered Hong Kong from the mainland as tourists.

    Make HK a hard liquor trading centre, says lawmaker

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB's Kennedy Wong said if Hong Kong didn't lower or scrap hard liquor duty, it would lose out to Hainan Island and Macau. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766395_1_20240816093031.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker Kennedy Wong says Hong Kong should scrap its 100 percent levy on strong alcohol so it can match the wine industry and become an international trading centre for hard liquor.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Wong said the wine trade had boomed since duty was scrapped in 2008 and revenue from sales of alcohol with a strength of over 30 percent was only HK$700 million. He also said Hong Kong needs to compete with Hainan, which will be tax free by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look at this issue from a trade perspective. If we don't lower or scrap the duty we are already losing out to Macau and the surrounding areas and at the end of this year, when Hainan turns into a free trade zone, a lot of the whisky, brandy promotions - because they are all aimed at the mainland China market - they'll all move to Hainan. Hard liquor from mainland China, like the Moutai, the Wuliangyee, they won't use Hong Kong to tap the international market, they might as well use Hainan," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong had the highest liquor duty in the region with Macau only charging 10 percent. He said Hong Kong also charged more than Taiwan and Japan, although the duty here was about the same as South Korea. He said Hainan, which caters mainly to the mainland domestic tourist market, had been declared a tax free area by the State Council in Beijing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said if Hong Kong followed the same route as the wine trade here, it could be an attractive place for companies wanting to sell top-of-the range hard liquor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You scrapped the duty so a lot of aged or vintage wine moved to Hong Kong and because Hong Kong also had first-class storage facilities - and because of our close proximity to the mainland China market, which is a big, big market you know for the wine industry - a lot of wine merchants created off-shoots here including a lot of French vineyards, chateaux that I know," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think likewise for liquor: for vodka, for whisky, for brandy, for the Moutai and so on. If they all create more trading companies here and then they are willing to move some of their vintage - the nice liquor - to Hong Kong, then Hong Kong will gradually climb back to the top of the world in this particular field."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month the DAB called on the Chief Executive John Lee to scrap the duty on hard liquor as part of its proposals for Lee's upcoming policy address.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's panda pair of Ying Ying and Le Le have finally produced babies, after they successfully mated in March this year at Ocean Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After five months of pregnancy, Ying Ying gave birth to one female and one male in the small hours of Thursday. Ocean Park, where the giant panda lives, said she spent much of her time lying on the ground and twisting, and that she was in labour for more than five hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ocean Park Hong Kong is thrilled to welcome the birth of the first-ever giant panda twins in Hong Kong," the amusement park said on its Facebook page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This birth is a true rarity, especially considering Ying Ying is the oldest giant panda on record to have successfully given birth for the first time," the park said, adding that she gave birth just one day before her 19th birthday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Both cubs are currently very fragile and need time to stabilise, especially the female cub who has a lower body temperature, weaker cries, and lower food intake after birth. Currently, both babies are under 24-hour intensive care by the park’s animal care and veterinary team, as well as experts from China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee called the birth of the panda twins a very special occasion, and thanked the nation for having gifted Ying Ying and Le Le to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Ocean Park's team for taking good care of the city's giant pandas and experts from the research centre for their support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year, with all provinces affected by the virus, the health minister said on Thursday in a statement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, worried by the rise in cases in DRC and the spread to nearby countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest epidemiological report, our country has recorded 15,664 potential cases and 548 deaths since the beginning of the year," Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The UN health agency's decision came the day after the African Union's health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile in the SAR, the government said it will continue to closely monitor the mpox situation and step up preventive measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health said it had written to doctors and hospitals in the territory, urging them to report suspected cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also strengthen travel health advice for people visiting Africa. (Additional reporting by AFP)

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested the driver of a tram involved in a fatal crash that killed a three-year-old girl in Western District on Thursday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tram was travelling along the eastbound track of Praya, Kennedy Town at 10.40am, officers said. But when it approached the pedestrian crossing near Des Voeux Road West, it reportedly knocked down four people who were crossing the road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A three-year-old girl was trapped under the tram and was rushed to Queen Mary Hospital in an unconscious state. She was certified dead at about 12.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A six-year-old girl, a 34-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man also sustained injuries and were sent to the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 48-year-old male driver on suspicion of dangerous driving causing death and that he is currently being detained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For their part, Hong Kong Tramways said that according to their preliminary understanding, the tram was operating as usual when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that they suspended the driver after the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department said it is very concerned about the incident and that it has asked the tramway operator to investigate it in detail and submit a report as soon as possible.

    Ridership, property earnings boost MTR profits

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR Corporation has proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766327_1_20240815183232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday reported an almost 45 percent rise in first-half profit compared with the same period last year, mainly driven by a strong recovery in ridership and earnings from property development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the railway firm conceded that passenger numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, even after patronage jumped more than four percent to surpass 950 million in the six months ending June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jacob Kam, the MTR's chief executive officer, said ridership had not been "very good" in the second quarter of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe there are many factors that would affect patronage, the overall economic situation, consumers' patterns, they all play a role," Kam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to be cautiously optimistic as the economy recovers. We hope that patronage will improve over time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first half of the year, the railway giant posted a net profit of HK$6 billion, up 44.7 percent from the same period in 2023. Total revenue rose 6.2 percent year-on-year to HK$29.3 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the MTR proposed an interim dividend of HK$0.42 per share, same as the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm also reversed its HK$774 million Hong Kong railway business loss into a profit of HK$415 million, while earnings from property development more than doubled to HK$1.74 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are making progress on 14 residential property projects. We will continue to explore property development opportunities along our existing and future railway lines, making optimal use of all land resources," Kam added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the firm will roll out more discounts for commuters, he said the corporation has to invest more than HK$100 billion for its projects in the future, and that it has to be prudent with its finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the railway giant is looking to tender the Tung Chung East project again after it failed to receive any bids last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively studying our projects and we are looking at our tender strategy. Subject to market conditions, we shall continue to orderly tender out our land parcels, in order to meet with the demands of Hong Kong," said David Tang, the firm’s property and international business director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for a land use study near Pak Shek Kok, the corporation said the assessment, which includes the possibility of constructing a new station along the East Rail Line, is still ongoing.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government also said measures to attract talent and import labour were having a positive impact.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's population fell by 0.1 percent between mid-2023 and the middle of 2024, according to government estimates released on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures by the Census and Statistics Department showed that the SAR's population slid from 7,536,100 in mid-2023, to 7,531,800 in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said the territory saw a net outflow of 30,200 residents, but 44,000 one-way permit holders came to the SAR, resulting in a net inflow of 13,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said the population saw a small increase in the first half of 2024 due to the introduction of various government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Benefiting from various measures on talent attraction and labour importation, there was sizeable inflow of persons from the mainland and other places around the world to Hong Kong in the first half of 2024," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paul Yip, a population expert from the University of Hong Kong, said authorities had to work on retaining talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to make the people who decided to come to Hong Kong, stay in Hong Kong...I think we also have to diversify our portfolio. Not only from mainland China, we also like to attract, some foreign talent from other places too," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to make Hong Kong to be a truly cosmopolitan city, I think we do need talent to come from different places, [like] the Belt and Road countries and also Europe or the US."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures showed that Hong Kong saw 34,400 births last year, a five percent increase from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies, along with other proposals to promote births, was announced in last year's Policy Address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yip said the policies announced last October might not be reflected in the official data yet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it would be very interesting to see whether there would be any substantial increase in 2024. But I think even if there is any impact, it will be quite limited," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's largest food festival kicked off at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai on Thursday, with enthusiastic bargain hunters racing inside as the doors opened at 10am sharp.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Some of the visitors to Food Expo said they had queued up overnight just to snap up bargains or freebies, such as ready-to-eat abalone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others were looking to rediscover old favourites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We bought some Taiwanese rice flour noodles, because we went to Taiwan before so I just want my kids to try again," said a woman surnamed Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tourists were also at the exhibition centre to sample new flavours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just got some coffee and some coffee beans. I'm from Australia so we really like coffee over there. I've got some peanut chocolate butter as well, that's really nice. Hadn't seen that before," Andrew Frank said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hopefully the customs doesn't take it away from me."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vendors, on the other hand, seized the chance to learn about the preferences of local customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Illugi Gunnarsson, who distributes Icelandic farm products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very good opportunity for us to meet people from Hong Kong, really see how they react to our products. But it also gives us an opportunity to sell, of course we like that, but mainly to understand our customers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau, meanwhile, underlined the contribution the convention and exhibition industry makes to the SAR's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The convention and exhibition industry has always been crucial to Hong Kong's economy by attracting high-spending overnight business visitors to Hong Kong, spurring economic activities and creating employment opportunities," Yau remarked at an opening ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am glad to know that this week's fairs have gathered over 1,800 high-quality exhibitors from 28 countries and regions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expo will take place until Monday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Thursday said it recorded about four million visitor arrivals in July, with about half involving overnight stays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The figure was a 10 percent increase on the same month last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 80 percent of July's visitors came from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said Hong Kong received about 25 million visitors in the first seven months of this year, over 50 percent more than the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the city held several events, including drone shows and pyrotechnic displays, adding that a survey of tourists found more than 90 percent believed the drone shows had enhanced their visit experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKTB said it will organise drone shows and pyrotechnic displays during Mid-Autumn Festival, Christmas and New Year's Eve, and will stage a new year countdown fireworks performance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Top Talent Services Association on Thursday said it welcomed a possible relaxation of the eligibility criteria for a talent attraction programme, saying it would draw more professionals to the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the moment, graduates of the world's top 100 universities are eligible to move to the SAR under the scheme. On Monday, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the government is considering expanding the list of universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Shang Hailong, who founded the association, said at a press briefing that an expansion would boost Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This plan would give more support to Hong Kong's economy, and provide more and more entrepreneurs coming to Hong Kong and make more startups in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shang also urged the government to offer more support to the children of professionals arriving in Hong Kong through the programme, saying they might encounter challenges when adapting to a new educational environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also called on employers to provide housing allowances to incoming professionals due to accommodation costs in the city.

 A three-year-old girl has died after being struck by a tram and getting trapped beneath it in Western District.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The accident, which happened outside the Kennedy Town Swimming Pool on Thursday, also saw two others injured.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency personnel were called to the scene after a report at around 10.44am that the trio, a man and two young girls aged three and six, had been knocked down by the tram.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the three-year-old was unconscious as she was rescued from underneath the vehicle. She was later pronounced dead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man and the elder girl were also taken to hospital for treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tram services between Kennedy Town Terminus and Hill Road were temporarily suspended following the incident.

    NGOs urged to spend more on cybersecurity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Francis Fong says NGOs should treat cybersecurity as a recurring expense. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766262_1_20240815122329.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An IT expert on Thursday urged NGOs, schools, and hospitals to prioritise cybersecurity spending, warning they are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This advice came after the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data estimated that roughly 470,000 people's personal data was stolen in a cyberattack against Oxfam Hong Kong last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, the honorary president of the Hong Kong Information Technology Federation and an Oxfam council member, told RTHK the council had instructed team members to notify all affected individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong explained that a key reason NGOs were prone to attacks was because of widespread work-from-home practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the pandemic because we used to work from home...We normally use a VPN to get into the office server so you can work remotely. But the problem is if you have not updated the firmware of the firewall, the VPN, the OS of the workstation server, even your antivirus or your security software, there are possibly many loopholes the hackers can attack the network and get the data from the server.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said staff awareness was lacking, noting many attacks were caused by employees tapping on suspicious web links or phishing emails.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong pointed to the need for a shift in organisations’ mindsets over cybersecurity spending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In the past, we all thought this was just like one-off expense for security measures, but now because of so many attacks, these expenses [should] become like a regular expense, at least like a yearly expense,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So you should actually update all your servers. You have to buy subscriptions of your firewall and your security software, so that you are being properly protected, and you have to do security audits at least once a year.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments on Thursday signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation in areas such as conservation and pollution control.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pact was signed during a ceremony at the University of Hong Kong to mark National Ecology Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The agreement is also aimed at stepping up joint efforts to combat climate change, ecological promotion and education, as well as preserving biodiversity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk said the SAR government has always tried its best to preserve nature, as part of efforts to build a beautiful China and Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said China has always stressed the need for people to co-exist with nature and adheres to President Xi Jinping's philosophy that "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are actively setting up the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which would be five times larger than the current wetland park. This would enhance the biodiversity and quality of the natural habitat in the Deep Bay area," Cheuk said in a speech.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also enhances the environmental capacity of the Northern Metropolis and achieves the co-existence of development and conservation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk added that over the next fortnight, the administration will team up with dozens of non-governmental organisations to hold a number of activities encouraging conservation, including free ecological tours and free admission to facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Shenzhen top official on natural resources, Xu Songming, said the pact between the two governments will allow a new level of mutual governance and sharing on ecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Shenzhen has always learned from Hong Kong's good example in terms of environmental protection, calling the SAR "the world's model city" for its green and low carbon developments.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said it strongly condemned remarks made by the last governor of colonial Hong Kong regarding a recent Court of Final Appeal ruling.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chris Patten, writing in the Guardian newspaper, described the top court's decision to uphold the convictions of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019, as "unjust".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the verdict was "made worse" because David Neuberger, a former president of Britain's supreme court, was a party to the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SAR administration said it opposed the former governor's "malicious slandering" against the verdict and his "wanton personal vilifications" against Lord Neuberger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patten's slandering remarks were made in blatant disregard of the detailed legal analysis by the [Court of Final Appeal] in its 76-page judgement and the factual background of the relevant case," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such remarks were made for the sole purpose of exerting political pressure on the judges ... in an attempt to influence the judicial system of the [Hong Kong SAR], and were nothing but a despicable political manoeuvre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also said Patten's criticisms against Neuberger were "completely groundless and unjustified personal attacks" aimed at smearing his reputation and undermining the system of non-permanent judges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone has the right to express his or her views on court decisions within the boundaries permitted by the law, but no one can abusively criticise or slander judges, or make baseless allegations purely out of political motives," the spokesperson added.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The group of more than 20 pupils from Yaumati Kaifong Association School crossed the border using a new travel permit issued to permanent residents who hold foreign passports.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ethnic minority pupils in Hong Kong who embarked on a mainland study tour under a new visa-free scheme said they had acquired much knowledge about the country's culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of more than 20 students from Yaumati Kaifong Association School returned to the SAR after a three-day trip across Guangdong province, designed to foster a deeper understanding of the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They learnt about martial arts, paper-cutting and Chinese calligraphy, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really enjoyed Chinese calligraphy. It's fun, beautiful and creative," said nine-year-old Dangal Zane, who learnt to write the Chinese character for "family".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now I know more about Chinese culture and arts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her schoolmate Limbu Maeson, 12, said the trip inspired him to contemplate living across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the future, maybe I'll decide to work there, because there are a lot of businesses," he said. "I feel like the education is more intense in China, because of the exams. Besides that, maybe it will be a good shot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maeson, just like others on the exchange tour, crossed the border using a new travel permit for permanent residents with foreign passports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time when we went to China, it took way longer and we were stressed out about what if we didn't make it," he said, adding that it only took him a minute to pass through immigration this time round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Ka-ho, a school manager who led the tour, had nothing but praise for the new travel scheme for non-Chinese SAR residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, they did not even have the chance to sign up for an exchange tour due to the lack of a permit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But that's not the case anymore. They could sign up for these tours ... so that they have more opportunities to take part in the country's development and observe the progress by travelling to the mainland."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Food Expo returns on Thursday at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai, as vendors remain hopeful about sales amid the changing spending habits of local consumers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, nearly half a million people thronged the five-day extravaganza, with the organiser, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, saying they spent an average of $1,500.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the recent trend of Hongkongers spending their weekends in Shenzhen and other parts of Guangdong Province has threatened local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council's marketing associate director, Eddie Lee, pointed out they've done a lot to promote this year's event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing a lot of promotion to communicate the selling point, and the highlights of our expos to...not just our local audience, and by these promotional activities in nearby areas, the Greater Bay Area, we hope also to attract visitors from our nearby cities to visit Hong Kong and participate in our fairs," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the 34th edition of the popular event will be held in conjunction with three other expos, featuring vendors specialising in tea, beauty and wellness products and home appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Admission costs $30 per adult, or $10 if they enter before noon on weekdays or after 6pm every night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An extra $10 is charged for those who wish to enter the "gourmet zone" where visitors are offered a taste of delicacies from around the world, including French foie gras, Australian abalone and Japanese vinegar.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said the Hong Kong Cyclothon will be revamped this year, with new routes and a sports-themed carnival being introduced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's largest cycling event will return on October 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race will go through the Sha Tin Heights Tunnel, while the 32-kilometre event will cross Ting Kau Bridge for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both races will start in Tsim Sha Tsui and end at the Jordan Road Flyover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Chan, the board's general manager of event and product development, said a carnival will be held in the West Kowloon Cultural District.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's actually very important for us to add more different elements to our Hong Kong Cyclothon," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for a lot of cyclists, after they finish their 50-kilometre or 32-kilometre [race], it will be actually good for them to have some relaxing experiences, either a dance class, yoga class or stretching class. It's a good hangout place for them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Registration for the cyclothon opens at 10am on August 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The board said it will accept more than 6,000 registrations in total this year – 800 more than last year.

    Tam Tak-chi to appeal sedition conviction in top court

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's top court on Wednesday granted jailed former activist Tam Tak-chi a final attempt to appeal against his conviction and sentence for sedition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three presiding judges at the Court of Final Appeal agreed to look into whether offences under now-repealed sedition laws must be tried at the Court of First Instance before a judge and a jury, and if the prosecution has to prove a defendant intended to incite others to commit violence or public disorder in order to secure a conviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appeal is set to be heard by Hong Kong's top court on January 10 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam, a former vice chairman of People Power, had lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his conviction and 40-month prison sentence for his chanting of slogans in the street in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Judges at the lower court ruled that the intention to incite violence was not a necessary element for the offence, and that there's nothing suggesting people were subject to "an unacceptably harsh burden" due to the restriction imposed by it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sedition offences stipulated by sections 9 and 10 of the Crimes Ordinance have since been repealed and replaced by provisions in Hong Kong's domestic national security law.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Some of the SAR's Olympians have mixed views over the remuneration local athletes receive, with some saying a better package would certainly help, while others said Hongkongers already receive good support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Entry level full-time athletes can get around HK$7,000 a month in sponsorship from the Sports Institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing a recent call from badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu, fencer Cedric Ho said more support would certainly help, noting that plenty of athletes have to do part-time jobs to make ends meet.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As someone who had been there myself, back in the day I would need to save money sometimes," he said on Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What I did was I was extremely thrifty, I don't go out for a meal and force myself to eat whatever at the institute."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, sailor Nicholas Halliday said Hong Kong athletes already do quite well compared to some overseas counterparts, calling the pay packages "reasonable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the airport, after competing at the Paris Olympics, another sailor, Russell Aylsworth, agreed, saying they "owe it all" to the institute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say the Hong Kong Sports Institute has given Nic and I and my sailing partner Akira Sakai tremendous support, they've been very, very helpful. Without them, I wouldn't be able to call myself an Olympian for sure," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I just want to thank everyone in Hong Kong for supporting and watching the both of us sail, I just want to inspire the youth, and for all the other sailors coming up, just to continue to train hard and push hard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Halliday and Ho said they plan to qualify for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for now, Halliday said he's looking forward to having some down time and enjoying some Hong Kong food favourites like cheung fun.

    Govt probing alleged resale of public hospital drugs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Medicine from a public hospital was allegedly sold via HKTVMall. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1766126_1_20240814124922.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched into suspicions that medicine from a public hospital ended up for sale on an e-commerce platform, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, HKTVMall said it had removed a merchant from its online marketplace after a buyer complained that packaging for an order came with a label indicating the product had originally been given to a patient of Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The product is a laxative which is not classed as a poison and does not require a prescription or for sales to be supervised by a pharmacist, the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevertheless, the administration expressed "grave concern over the suspected resale of public hospital patients' medicines" and said the matter will be dealt with seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DH (Department of Health) is liaising with the Hospital Authority to seriously investigate into the alleged case and shall take prompt enforcement action as appropriate," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For this specific case, the DH will investigate along the line of illegal sale of unregistered pharmaceutical products."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, So Yiu-wah, president of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists, suggested that "over-prescribing" of medicines by public hospitals could have played a role in the alleged incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patient rights advocate Tim Pang, from the Society for Community Organisation, said doctors at public hospitals tend to dish out too much medication because of the length of time patients have to wait for their next consultation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang said more community pharmacies would solve this problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because if there are enough community pharmacies for patients to refill the drugs, then the public hospital doctors can prevent from prescribing a lot of drugs to the patients during that waiting period," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ten thousand flats will be built near the future Pak Shek Kok MTR Station next to Tolo Harbour and the Science Park, the government said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new East Rail Line station, between Tai Po Market and University, is expected to be completed by 2033.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the Development Bureau said the MTR Corporation is carrying out extensive technical assessments for the station's construction and land development strategies, with a detailed plan for the project to be announced later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Scott Leung said the MTR station and related transport infrastructure should be built before the residential units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung, who's also a member of the Housing Authority, said this approach would ensure efficient and convenient transport for the residents.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources told RTHK the government was working to have two giant pandas arrive in the SAR by late September.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two adult pandas, aged between five and eight, are a gift from mainland authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government confirmed that Secretary for Culture, Sports, and Tourism Kevin Yeung would attend a signing ceremony for a cooperation agreement in Sichuan regarding the arrival of the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will head to the province on Thursday morning with representatives from Ocean Park, and will oversee the logistics of transporting the animals to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said Yeung would also be responsible for naming the pandas, adding that September 26 is one of the potential arrival dates for the pandas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before Yeung's return to Hong Kong on Friday, Raistlin Lau will serve as acting culture, sports, and tourism chief.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee had earlier paid a visit to Sichuan, and said the male panda chosen by mainland authorities is agile and smart, while the female panda is gentle and cute.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Insurers may not pay out if trips to Japan are cancelled or cut short in the event that a feared "megaquake" in the country actually materialises, an industry representative said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On August 8, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern island of Kyushu, prompting Japanese authorities to issue their first-ever warning of an increased risk of a major quake in the near future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Federation of Insurers has urged travellers to carefully study the fine print of their policies, adding that they may not cover disruption linked to a "known risk" such as any further quake connected to the one of last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [insurance] scheme was purchased after the initial earthquake on August 8, then people may not receive compensation if their trip was cancelled or cut short," said the federation's chief executive, Selina Lau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Hong Kong airport, a man surnamed Lo and his family were checking in for their flight to Tokyo on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said they decided to go ahead with the 10-day trip after confirming their travel insurance was still valid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We planned the trip for a very long time. I don't want to disappoint my kids and family. It is a bit risky, but we still want to go," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A woman surnamed Yip said she had "no choice" but to go ahead with her trip to Osaka as she did not want to lose the money she paid for the flights and hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I booked the trip around five months ago and I could not apply for a refund now," she said, adding that her insurer had reassured her that the trip would still be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have checked the consulate's phone numbers and if anything happens, I will deal with it when it comes," she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Productivity Council on Tuesday warned that a high interest rate environment is putting pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with business confidence among SMEs dropping to the lowest point in two years
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to a quarterly survey conducted by the council in July, 56 percent of the 814 local businesses interviewed said high interest rates had affected consumer spending, with the most affected industries being retail, accommodation and food services and real estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also, about one-third of the SMEs interviewed said they had a cash flow or supply chain problem because of the high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council said business sentiment among SMEs remained cautious, with the latest Standard Chartered Hong Kong SME Leading Business Index recording a decline in confidence to 42.5 points, dropping from 47.3 in the previous quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief innovation officer Lawrence Cheung said 10 of the 11 industries involved in the survey had shown a drop in confidence, with real estate having the lowest score. He said that indicated both external and domestic-oriented sectors were under-performing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Standard Chartered senior economist Kelvin Lau said the survey indicated a lack of confidence among SMEs over the global economic outlook due to external uncertainties lingering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Number one is the possibility of [Donald] Trump coming into office after the US elections in November. And the other being China's recent macro data weakness following its slightly weaker than expected Q2 GDP [growth], which came in at 4.7 percent rather than anything closer to 5 percent,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So overall, it's kind of like a double whammy that the local businesses need to worry about the US and they need to worry about China.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he added there are certain bright spots, citing expectations the US Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates from September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our own view is that we could see a collective 75 basis points of cuts between now and the year-end and possibly even more cuts in the first half of next year, to as much as 125 basis points in total,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So that would hopefully be a lot of relief to the Hong Kong SMEs, in particular the real estate sector, for example, and to some extent the accommodation and food services sector as well.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 People on low-incomes in Hong Kong are struggling to afford nutritious food and some are having to skip meals altogether due to rising prices, an NGO said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Food Grace said it carried out a survey involving more than 500 underprivileged people in Kwai Tsing and Sham Shui Po, finding that a third had cut back on the number of meals they ate due to financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of the respondents said that to save money, they either opted for less healthy food or went hungry on occasions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NGO described the situation as worrying and urged the government to provide food subsidies to those in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Angela Lo, project manager with the group, said better education on healthy eating would benefit many people who need to cook on a limited budget.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Tuesday said underprivileged students who are taking part in a government mentorship scheme in Hangzhou have been able to learn a lot about Chinese culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister is leading a delegation taking some 80 teenagers to the mainland city, as part of the Strive and Rise Programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after a museum visit, Chan told reporters the teenagers he spoke to have become more confident and pro-active.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last year we began by organising five tours, and the reaction was quite good. Students who joined were all very happy. This year we've increased to 18 tours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Going forward, we want to encourage more enterprises and partners to offer us more sponsorships, so we can organise more of these activities that allow children to go on trips and learn more about the country."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added it's important for the students to gain knowledge from their mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who retired right after her victory at the Paris Games to join the Jockey Club, is also part of the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Strive and Rise Programme was introduced in Chief Executive John Lee's maiden policy address in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hospital bosses have expressed concerns and vowed to take follow-up action after a woman was allegedly sold a medication prescribed by a public hospital from a purchase via HKTVmall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The online shopping site said it had removed the product from its shelves and was investigating the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a photo circulating online, the woman, who was reportedly 38 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident, complained she had placed an order for lactulose, but received the laxative with another patient's name and information indicating it was from Hong Kong Buddhist Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident came to light on Monday following a post on the online discussion forum LIHKG, with the woman who claimed to be the buyer expressing concern about the quality of the medication and whether it would affect her baby.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, HKTVmall said the customer reported an issue with the product on July 9 last year, upon receiving the order on May 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the vendor was unable to provide information about the order, given that it had been delivered to her in May 2023, with relevant security camera footage and photos deleted, while the report was filed more than a month after delivery
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site said it had removed the seller from its platform and the vendor must provide valid information of its proof of delivery, HKTVmall added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If violations are found, the vendor will be penalised. In serious cases, we will terminate the contract, and the vendor concerned will have to bear the relevant legal responsibilities," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority, for its part, said it was very concerned about the incident and reminded people not resell or pass the drugs for others' use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials would follow up seriously and refer to law enforcement agencies if any illegal activities were found, the authority added.

    Olympics boost sales at Kwun Tong mall

<div class="itemFullText">
 Crowds flocking to malls to watch the Paris Olympics boosted footfall, an operator said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties' leasing department said its mall in Kwun Tong saw 20 percent more people compared to the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said this was because social distancing measures were still in place during the Tokyo Games, adding that there was a joyous atmosphere this time due to the success of the SAR and national teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said sales went up significantly at restaurants, as well as stores selling trainers which saw a 20 percent increase in business. She said watching the events inspired people to take up exercise or sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Another reason [for increased sales] was that there were breaks between matches, the short ones lasted five to 10 minutes, while long ones could span over half an hour, or one hour. During this period of time, as residents wanted to continue watching the Games, they would wander around and return to the atrium to watch the match after enjoying their meals," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said business at eateries rose 15 percent during the Paris Olympics, with people heading to shopping malls to watch the Games, and shops opening much longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said food delivery services also enjoyed a 10 percent growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there are a lot of people going to spend their time and entertain themselves in the Greater Bay Area, especially in Shenzhen, during the Olympics, I saw that more people stayed in Hong Kong, especially during night-time," Wong told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[For] some people, even though they went to Shenzhen during the day, they rushed back to Hong Kong, just wanting to view the competitions."

 Hong Kong stocks opened higher on Tuesday, as worries about a US recession that sent markets into turmoil last week eased ahead of key inflation data, while oil prices held gains on concerns about a broader war in the Middle East.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hang Seng Index rose 48 points, or 0.28 percent, to open at 17,160.
  <br/>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan is on a visit to Hangzhou. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765914_1_20240812215848.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Monday said the government is considering loosening the eligibility criteria of one of its talent schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, people who graduated from the top 100 universities or institutions in designated world rankings can apply for a work visa in Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters in Hangzhou, Chan said the government is reviewing the scheme to possibly include more universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are some universities whose subjects may not be in the top 100 in the world, yet they are popular and very good. We are currently reviewing the scheme to see if these universities should be added to the scheme," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You can never have too many talent. The more talent there are, the more useful they will be to Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan is joining a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme visiting the capital of Zhejiang province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have participated in quite a lot of activities under the programme, but all of them were held in Hong Kong," he said during the welcoming dinner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Today is also my first time to leave Hong Kong with our fellow students for the mainland. I am looking forward to visiting Hangzhou Branch of the National Archives of Publications and Culture with you all tomorrow, to learn about the rich history of our country and Zhejiang."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will also meet with leaders of Hangzhou and Zhejiang to discuss deepening cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy mayor of Hangzhou, Xu Weihua, highlighted Hong Kong's role as Hangzhou's largest source of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As of the end of last year, Hong Kong companies had invested in 8,278 projects in Hangzhou, with a total investment of US$256.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are 56 businesses from Hangzhou that are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In fact, it's not an easy feat. There are 305 publicly listed companies in Hangzhou in total, and one-sixth of them are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Xu said he hopes more reciprocal visits between Hangzhou and Hong Kong would take place, and the two cities would explore deeper collaboration and exchanges in areas such as trade and technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said the five-day trip will be a very valuable experience for the youths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong, who's now an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club, is also taking part in the trip.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday urged Hongkongers in Japan to be careful after the country's authorities warned a "megaquake" was possible.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Japanese officials issued their first ever megaquake advisory last Thursday after a 7.1-magnitude quake hit the south of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR administration said Hongkongers in Japan should exercise caution, attend to their personal safety and pay attention to announcements on the latest situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Security Bureau said it will continue to closely monitor the situation. It urged any Hong Kong residents who need help to contact the Immigration Department or the Chinese Embassy.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they have arrested a 27-year-old man after finding more than 200 kilogrammes of cocaine in a flat in Tuen Mun.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the haul has a street value of HK$175 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrest was made in Lok Ma Chau on Saturday and officers said the suspect is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said the flat where the drugs were found had recently been rented out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We would like to make an appeal here, especially to large property owners. If they notice potential tenants who seem extremely eager to rent these units or even request renting immediately after a quick look around, they should be extra cautious and pay attention to their backgrounds," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday urged the government to set up a system to register subdivided flats in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This comes as the government is preparing a report on ways to address substandard accommodation, including setting minimum standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB members visited more than 20 subdivided flats as part of a study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party is proposing that subdivided flats should have a minimum area of seven square metres and a minimum height of 1.8 metres and must comply with building and fire safety regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said that for safety reasons, the kitchen and bathroom in these flats should be separate, adding that the government should prioritise eliminating unsafe subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have seen quite a lot of fire accidents, some of the poor subdivided units don't have windows and fire protection... this makes it quite dangerous for the people who live inside," said lawmaker Vincent Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party also says residents of units deemed to be unacceptable should be provided with rehousing options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [residents] live in a very poor subdivided unit, they can choose to move into transitional housing," said Cheng.

    Pest that strips trees bare now on HK Island: expert

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A pest which ravages the leaves of trees like the Chinese banyan leaving them bare is increasing being found on Hong Kong Island after spreading from other parts of the territory in the hot weather, an expert warned on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Larvae of the Phauda flammans moth feed on the leaves of ficus trees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The insect was a rare sight in the SAR until around 2019 when it appeared in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long, according to Ken So, chief executive of The Conservancy Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now the number of trees on Hong Kong Island affected by the pest is increasing, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For insects, because the life cycle can be shortened or the reproduction of insects can always be affected by weather conditions, particularly talking about the temperature. Higher temperatures would favour the reproduction or growth of insects. So likely, the problem of Phauda flammans is highly related to hotter weather," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said pesticides can be used to control the insect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the larvae eat the leaves with pesticides, then it will kill the larvae, so that it stops or terminates the life cycle of the insects," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So added that professionals are also developing a trap specifically for Phauda flammans.

    Top court dismisses appeal over 2019 assembly case

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two of the appellants, Margaret Ng (left) and Martin Lee (right), attended the hearing at the Court of Final Appeal. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765839_1_20240812115111.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's top court has unanimously dismissed a final attempt by Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai and six former lawmakers to overturn their convictions for taking part in an unauthorised march in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai, Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the procession on August 18, which followed an approved anti-police demonstration led by the now-disbanded Civil Human Rights Front.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While a lower court earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, it upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final appeal had centred on the issue of "operational proportionality", a principle set out by two decisions of Britain's Supreme Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The appellants argued that the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, and that a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But judges at the Court of Final Appeal on Monday rejected the argument that the arrest, prosecution, conviction and sentence must be separately justified as proportionate, saying a separate proportionality inquiry was "inappropriate and uncalled for".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The defendants' convictions and consequent sentences do not stand alone. They are the result of the judge applying the law to the evidence and being satisfied individually of their guilt," the ruling said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The same pertains to the defendants' proposition in respect of arrest and prosecution. Those actions similarly do not occur in isolation. They represent steps taken to enforce particular offence-creating laws."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the presiding judges, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung and Roberto Ribeiro, said the two British legal precedents cited by the appellants "should not be followed in Hong Kong" because of differences between the two jurisdictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, statutory and other provisions which are found to be unconstitutional may be struck down as invalid whereas in the UK, a provision that is declared to be incompatible continues to be enforced as a valid law, with potentially different issues regarding proportionality arising thereafter," the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow justice Johnson Lam added that there is no basis in the SAR to consider the prosecution, conviction and sentence as "distinct, standalone restrictions" from the rule creating the offence relating to freedom of assembly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury, a non-permanent judge from Britain, said the constitutional differences in Hong Kong and the UK "do not mandate a different approach when it comes to considering whether a restriction on the freedom of assembly is proportionate", but they "do require a different approach if the court concludes that the restriction is not proportionate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who attended the hearing, said it was not appropriate to comment on the ruling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't had a chance to look at this very important judgement. This is not the right time to make comments. We just want to take this occasion to thank our legal teams and all the people who have been supporting us all the time," she said outside the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, left the court saying he had "no comment".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Space Museum says the Perseid meteor shower will peak before dawn on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual meteor shower has been active since last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Chiu from the museum said around 100 meteors per hour are expected between 11:30pm on Monday and 5am on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu said Clear Water Bay will be one of the best locations for seeing them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the weather is suitable for watching, we would suggest people go to the extremely dark and also the wide sky area to watch the meteor shower. And the suggested area that's actually in the kite-flying area, Tai Mei Tuk and Clear Water Bay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chiu also said the museum will livestream the meteor shower on its YouTube channel, while offering insights into the astronomical aspects of the shooting stars.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday congratulated the SAR's athletes for their achievements at the Paris Olympics, noting it was the first time that Team Hong Kong, China had won more than one gold medal at the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Golds from foil fencer Edgar Cheung and épée fencer Vivian Kong, as well as two swimming bronzes from Siobhan Haughey, put the SAR 37th in the medals table, which is the city's highest ever ranking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every Hong Kong athlete has given their utmost and unleashed their full potential in the Olympic arena. In spite of the results, all athletes have fully exhibited their determination, perseverance and will, demonstrating their professional attitude and sportsmanship," Lee said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The people of Hong Kong and I are deeply inspired and moved. The people of Hong Kong are proud of the high level of performance shown by Hong Kong athletes, and each and every one of them is a hero in our hearts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the government would provide more sporting facilities, such as converting an existing sports centre into a dedicated fencing venue, and speeding up a study on building a fencing arena and a swimming pool which can host international competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that in the current financial year, the administration had provided more than HK$940 million in funding to the Sports Institute through the Elite Athletes Development Fund, around a 40 percent increase from five years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said with the Paris Paralympic Games later this month and Hong Kong co-hosting the National Games next year, he's confident that society would continue to support the SAR's athletes to shine and "demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Hong Kong".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 RTHK on Sunday co-hosted a show with the public broadcaster in Indonesia at the Victoria Park, where the audience was treated to performances from local and Indonesian singers and dancers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Indonesian singer Nabilla Gomes flew in to perform live at "RTHK Summer POP UP", and she was joined on stage by Hong Kong singer Lagchun, Indonesian-Hong Kong singer-songwriters and dance groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The event aimed to foster bond among people from the two places, which is among cooperation priorities of China's Belt and Road Initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In February, RTHK signed a memorandum of understanding with the Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) to strengthen cooperation, jointly producing a radio programme, "Halo Jakarta! Hello Hong Kong!", in Bahasa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme was broadcast on both stations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Director of Broadcasting, Eddie Cheung, noted that Sunday's event was a celebration of Indonesia’s Independence Day, as it allowed the programme to go outdoors for greater interaction with the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The event shows that Hong Kong is an open and inclusive society," he said while giving a speech at the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through joint programmes and events, the two broadcasters show how to put people-to-people bond under the Belt and Road Initiative into practice."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, the Indonesian Consul-General, Yul Edison, said the media have a growing importance in today's world in connecting people, combating stereotypes and addressing misinformation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Jennifer Valente of the United States on Sunday retained her Olympic title in the women’s omnium at the Paris Games while the SAR's Ceci Lee finished 20th.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That concluded Hong Kong, China's participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente ended with 144 points in the multi-race event, consisting of the scratch, tempo, elimination and points races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poland’s Daria Pikulik took silver while Ally Wollaston of New Zealand rounded up the podium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first scratch race, cyclists were ranked and awarded points by the order they finished the 30-lap event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente was off to a strong start and finished first, earning the maximum 40 points, with Canada’s Maggie Coles-Lyster and Georgia Baker of Australia coming from behind to grab second and third respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, making her Olympic debut, came 19th among the 22 riders to earn four points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist moved up to 18th overall after the second tempo race, where the top contestant per lap was awarded a point from the fifth lap forward while 20 points were given for lapping an opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ireland’s Lara Gillespie came out on top in this race but Valente maintained her overall lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 23-year-old SAR athlete earned 16 points by finishing 13th, giving her 20 points at the end of the first half.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the elimination round, the last cyclist of every other lap was knocked out of the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Valente won this round as well to continue to top the leaderboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, meanwhile, was the fifth athlete eliminated and ended up with six points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final points race, points were awarded to the top four athletes for every 10 laps in the gruelling 80-lap race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR cyclist finished near the bottom of the pack in the race that was won by Poland’s Pikulik.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Afterwards, a tearful Lee described her performance as "very poor", saying she felt she let many people down, including her coaches, teammates and the former top SAR cyclist Sarah Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like in the past, I did very poorly in the scratch race, and I couldn't change that today," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though Sarah Lee very diligently tried to pass on her experience to me before the race, I still did very poorly. Coaches and teammates spent a lot of time training with me for the omnium, but I still raced very poorly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She had said she hoped to finish in the top 10 overall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee, who won silver at the Asian Games last year, added that her Paris experience allowed her to get a taste of just how good the world's finest cyclists are. She also said she hopes to work hard in future to improve her fitness and use of tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR's cycling team head coach, Herve Dagorne, said while he could understand her frustrations, he felt she could have been more aggressive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the ominum, and the last event is the points race. You need to score points, so if you don't try, you don't get it, it will not come from the sky," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can understand it's disappointing... I wish she could have attacked more in the points race, like the Japanese did and the French did. They gained a lap, [scoring] 20 points."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation earned a total of four medals in Paris: golds for fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung, and two bronzes from swimming star Siobhan Haughey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung will be the flagbearers for the SAR at the closing ceremony.

 Police on Sunday said they have arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of drug trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they confiscated 34kg of suspected methamphetamine and 1kg of ketamine, with a total street value of HK$18.5 million, in a Cheung Sha Wan flat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police discovered that this drug-trafficking syndicate was renting an upscale private residential flat as a warehouse and a distribution centre for drugs. They took advantage of the low foot traffic and heavy security in an attempt to evade law enforcement," inspector Chang Yuen-lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police urge property owners to check the backgrounds of potential tenants such as occupation, income verification and the intended use of the rented unit before renting them out, so as to prevent their properties from being misused by criminals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect is set to appear in court on Monday.

    HKers putting rope skipping on the map in Paris

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Olympic delegation isn’t the only team representing the SAR in Paris – the city’s rope skipping performance squad is also in the French capital to push for their sport to be included in future editions of the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rope skipping troupe is amping up the atmosphere at the Paris Games by performing at the Place de la Concorde, which has become the heart of urban sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time in history, various urban disciplines, such as 3x3 basketball, street and park skateboarding, BMX freestyle and breaking, have been grouped together at one site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though these sports have increasingly been adopted in the past two Games, there are those, like rope skipping, that still have not made their way to the Olympic stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's what the Hong Kong Rope Skipping Association, China, is hoping to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They are among a number of groups from around the world who have been invited to perform at the open stage of Parc Urbain to promote urban culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tina Wong, the association's chairperson, said performing in Paris is an opportunity they could not pass up, even though the Games conflicted with the jump rope Asian Championships in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are here on the Olympic platform. We actually have the goal or you could say dream to have jump rope skipping to be included in the Olympics in 2032 in Australia because Australia is one the strongest countries in this sport. This is a more long-term goal. On a short-term basis, we are aiming for Asia,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Actually last year, the Olympic Council of Asia has already granted rope skipping the provisional membership, so meaning we are already included in Asia. This year, we are here. Next year, we are aiming to go to the Youth Asian Games and pave the way for the Asian Games and then the Olympics. We hope with more support, we can officially be on the Olympic stage soon.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four athletes from the SAR have made their way to Paris to perform, including 18-year-old Yuen Hiu-tung, who said that the atmosphere was unbelievable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s like a dream to come here because even though we paid to come here, it’s a very valuable experience for us because we don’t know when jump rope can get into [the] Olympics, so it is a good experience to promote jump rope, and also letting everyone know how is jump rope [works] and how everyone is enjoying this sport,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The honorary secretary general of Hong Kong's top sports body, Edgar Yang, on Sunday said the city should nurture all athletes with potential, rather than solely focusing on one or two elite athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to a TV programme, the senior member of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China said the SAR has huge potential for sports development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the system must be very sound, and this sound method starts from popularising and definitely not focusing on just one or two athletes - but rather on the overall system that can bring out potential. We must put in a great effort. Even for those who have not yet fully realised their potential, we must enable them to be inspired," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Paris Olympics nears its end, Yang said Hong Kong athletes are now world class.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR athletes have secured two gold medals in fencing and two bronze medals in swimming.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Financial Secretary Paul Chan was writing on his weekly blog. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765722_1_20240811124413.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on his blog on Sunday that Hong Kong should integrate further with China's national development and contribute to modernisation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan said that the Third Plenary Session held in Beijing last month passed the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform and Promoting Chinese-style Modernization," which outlines Hong Kong's strategic positioning in leveraging the advantages of the "One Country, Two Systems" framework, enhances the city's status as an international hub, and supports Hong Kong's bid in gathering top international talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As an international financial centre, Chan said that Hong Kong should fulfil its role as an offshore RMB business hub, focusing on shipping centre development, smart shipping, and green shipping, to make Hong Kong a "cross-border supply chain management centre" that provides one-stop support for mainland enterprises in expanding their production capacity and supply chain layout overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said this will generate new trade service demands and attract greater opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the SAR government is also recruiting talent and has launched a series of initiatives like the Top Talent Pass Scheme that supports talent development, to attract more top international talent to the region.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic fencing gold medallist Vivian Kong on Sunday kicked off her visit to Hangzhou with a youth delegation from the government's Strive and Rise Programme - a mentorship scheme aimed at helping underprivileged Hong Kong teenagers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During the five-day trip, Kong, along with the delegation, will visit technology companies and athlete training centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters ahead of her departure, Kong said she wanted to give something back to Hong Kong, as she started her new job as an assistant external affairs manager at the Jockey Club.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as an athlete, I worked really hard to train and to make Hong Kong people proud, to win results and to unite everyone so that we can all enjoy sports. And now that I'm lucky enough to join the Jockey Club, I wish I could use my platform and use the power of sports to unite everyone and hopefully just make sure that we all love sports and be happier," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Raymond Tam, the Jockey Club's executive director of corporate affairs, said dozens of underprivileged pupils were joining the trip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Eighty-four pupils and five mentors will take part in the five-day tour. The itinerary is diverse, ranging from innovation and technology, history, culture, to sports. We expect that senior officials from the SAR will also join this tour," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong announced her retirement from full-time fencing last week, after she won the women's individual epee gold medal at the Paris Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday unveiled that Hong Kong recorded more than 45,300 crimes during the first half of the year, a 5.6 percent increase from the same period a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deception made up about 40 percent of all cases. Victims – who were mostly scammed online – were swindled out of HK$4.48 billion in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Even though the number of "Guess Who" phone scams were down by 61 percent, the force pointed out that fraudsters had adopted new tactics such as impersonating staff of e-shopping and online payment platforms, and telecommunications companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force also revealed that its robbery detection rate of 84.1 percent was the highest since it started maintaining statistics for the period in 1977, with police stepping up anti-burglary patrols, especially in areas with village houses. Officers noted they used drones and partnered with the Government Flying Service to carry out air patrols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of June 30 this year, 300 arrests have been made under the National Security Law that was put in place four years ago, it added. About 60 percent of those arrested have been charged.

Photo Courtesy of Information Services Department" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=15&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1765623_1_20240810140640.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 1,000 policymakers, researchers and young entrepreneurs gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre on Saturday for the city's first youth development summit, organised by the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee said young people should learn from the Olympic spirit and be inspired by Hong Kong's young athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we can't all be Olympic champions, we can all be champions of our own stories. We can all live in the spirit of the Olympic motto, faster, higher, stronger, together, in our pursuit," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Olympic gold medallist Vivian Kong also attended the summit, where she showed her medal from the Paris Games to audience members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong, who won gold in the women's individual epee, said she was initially very nervous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every time I was nervous, I would turn and channel all that energy into training. So the more nervous I got, the more training I did, and that gave me the confidence to be like: okay, I am doing everything I can to fence the best that I can at the Olympics and I shouldn't be scared, I shouldn't be worried about the results", the 30-year-old fencer said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said that the government's youth development blueprint could provide all-round support to its targeted beneficiaries of those aged between 12 and 39.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The blueprint was rolled out in December 2022, with around 60 additional measures added last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them includes the Member Self-recommendation Scheme for youth. The government is working to triple the number of participating advisory committees to not less than 180 in the current term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To date, 85 government advisory committees have joined the scheme, covering trade and industry, innovation and technology, human resources planning, child affairs, and much more," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He emphasised that the energy, creativity, and resilience of young people will help create a better future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A University of Hong Kong paediatrician on Saturday said the SAR has seen a large rise in scarlet fever cases this year, and he advised early treatment with antibiotics to prevent complications. The disease, which is caused by streptococcal infection, usually affects children.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan, from the university's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, said symptoms include high fever and a red body rash that leaves an in-print if touched. Speaking on a radio programme, he gave more details about the rise in case numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In Hong Kong, for example last year, the notification rate in fact is less than 10 every month. But in Hong Kong this year, the notification rate, up until last month was around 260 in June. So the number is really high, and this indicated the streptococcal strep A activity is really high among our population," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lau Yu-lung, chairman of the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases, said there had been 4,500 Covid cases in Hong Kong last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the 31st week of this year - between July 28 and August 3 - sewage surveillance showed that infections seemed to have reached their peak. But it's too early to say whether there has been any decline," he said, while appearing on the same radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau said there had been seven outbreaks in care homes last week involving 60 patients, and the situation is worrying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Covid jab could significantly lower the mortality rate, and he urged vulnerable people, such as those suffering from chronic illnesses, as well as people in care homes to get a booster.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Saturday said businesses should be more open to employing athletes once they retire, as they have already shown their abilities on a global stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Yeung said the government had allocated resources to help athletes once they step down. He said most have skills that are highly sought by employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually we hope the business sector will consider employing more athletes because we think they have a lot of abilities: such as how they face challenges, how they remain calm under pressure, and their perseverance. These are qualities we hope society will be able to see, and we hope the business sector will be able to give athletes more chances," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said universities here have been admitting athletes through their top athletes admission scheme and granting them a longer study period so they can attend training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the promotion of sport in the community is crucial if new talent is to be discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government is trying to promote different kinds of sport in the community.... When more people are involved in sport, more people will develop an interest in sport, and it will be easier for us to find talent and give them the resources to train their skills," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are also supporting the Hong Kong Sports Institute and The Jockey Club to do research into how to increase athletic performances and make use of human science to improve training," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the Paris Games had encouraged people to go out in the evening and watch Olympic events, which are free-to-air. He said the catering industry had recorded around a 30 percent increase in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked whether the government would continue to purchase the Olympic Games broadcasting rights in future, Yeung said the government would consider sporting events on a case-by-case basis.

    HK's pioneering Olympic judges pave the way forward

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The road to the Olympics is not easy for athletes, but it’s just as hard for judges who likely spend the same amount of time and effort in training to be able to officiate Olympic events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For gymnastics judge Yuen Ka-keung, the journey to Paris was lonely and arduous, but one that he hopes will pave the way for others to follow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Being an Olympic gymnastics judge is not easy because you have to pass many of the selection [tests] under the International Federation, so you had to prepare a lot, meaning that you had to spend a lot of the time and also you had to manage everything well,” Yuen, who is judging the Olympics for the third time in Paris, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have to allocate my time and also allocate, for example, money to make the proper preparation for this Olympic Games. Another thing is that if you prepare for the Olympic Games very seriously, you will feel alone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen is the only gymnastics judge from the SAR. To qualify, he had to judge designated events within the Olympics cycle and obtain the best evaluation result in two competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The veteran gymnast said he hopes the government will put more resources into training athletes, and those behind the scenes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Gymnastics is not only [about the] coach and gymnast. We should have many more supporting people, for example the judge, the physiotherapist, the psychologist and other people,” Yuen said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex Wong, one of the two cycling judges from Hong Kong appointed by the International Federation, echoed Yuen’s views.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In Hong Kong, we can organise different kinds or different levels of judge development or training courses and encourage the people to have the qualification to enter the international training courses," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Just like me, when I prepared for the international commissaire course, I paid [for it] myself,  [so I could] visit different kinds of large-scale events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, who played a leading role on the judging team for cycling at the Hangzhou Asian Games, said he feels proud to be a part of the world's biggest sporting event for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also stressed that safety is paramount on the racetrack.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We stand on the track to monitor the behaviour of the riders and also the behaviour of different TV broadcast staff members. Because we need to protect all the people on the track,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In case any accident happens, the riders will go out of the track with the bike and at that moment [there will be] a serious accident if we don't manage it in a proper way.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that he hopes newcomers can have more exposure to large-scale cycling events in Asia before they become judges.

 SAR cyclist Ceci Lee and taekwondo athlete Lo Wai-fung have been named as the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China team at the Olympic closing ceremony on August 11.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ceremony will take place at the Stade de France, which hosted athletics and rugby sevens during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, a Olympic debutant, will compete in the women’s omnium on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fencers Vivian Kong and Edgar Cheung each won a gold for the SAR, and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey snatched two bronze medals at the Paris Olympics.

    Ocean Park unveils study on late male panda An An

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study on one of the Hong Kong's beloved giant pandas could shed light on life-long care for the animals, according to researchers who had monitored the late An An.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ocean Park on Friday said it had conducted a study on the world's oldest zoo-housed male giant panda, covering the final two years of his life and tracking his activities, movement patterns, and habitat preferences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Results showed that An An, who lived 35 years or roughly 105 human years, conserved energy by favouring gentle slopes when going uphill and steeper paths when descending.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers said this behaviour – which led the animal to cover greater distances uphill than downhill – mirrored that of wild giant pandas, researchers said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park's senior research fellow, Eszter Matrai, said the study will help improve future enclosure designs for ageing pandas and can also be considered for other animals at zoos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This provides an objective measure of lifestyle changes based on life stages in terms of age and illnesses. The results can be used for habitat optimisation and sustainable improvement for life-long care,” Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the study contributed to the limited literature on the behaviour of geriatric animals, because previous studies on ageing pandas had primarily focused on veterinary medicine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These findings go beyond design enhancements, guiding tailored care plans and enrichment activities based on age-related behavioural changes and seasonal variations," Matrai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An An was one of two giant pandas gifted by the central government to Hong Kong in 1999. He died in July 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR is sending 23 athletes to Paris for the upcoming Paralympic Games, with prize rewards nearly doubled to reward Paralympians.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The athletes representing Hong Kong, China, are set to compete in eight sports. The squad includes wheelchair fencer Alison Yu, who will be competing at the Paralympics for the sixth time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yu, who has won seven Paralympic gold medals, three silvers and one bronze, said it is important to get into the right mindset in the last weeks leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm so looking forward to competing at the Grand Palais... In the Olympic Games, we saw Edgar Cheung and Vivian Kong get gold medals at the Grand Palais, so I think the Grand Palais is a lucky place for us," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will try to relax a bit from fencing, not thinking so much about fencing and trying to be ready mentally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For rider Natasha Tse, she said it is an honour to compete for the SAR in her fourth Paralympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My challenges in this Games are on how to get used to my new horse, or how to get used to the weather, or even the accuracy in my test," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First-time Paralympian Leung Chung-yan, who will compete in the men's table tennis singles, said he is excited to play and hopes to win a match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officiating at the flag ceremony ahead of the Games, Chief Executive John Lee pointed to higher rewards for Paralympians, with a gold medal winning solo athlete set to receive HK$1.5 million. He also said the entire city is behind the SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All of you have overcome various challenges to reach the pinnacle of sport, competing with athletes from all over the world on the Paralympic stage. We are proud of you," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Your participation not only represents your personal efforts and achievements but also represent Hong Kong's support and recognition of parasports."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Paris Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8.

    DAB urges government to tackle rat problem in Wan Chai

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday raised concerns about a rodent problem in the back alleys of Wan Chai and called for government intervention to tackle it.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department shows that Wan Chai is the most infested of Hong Kong's 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent DAB survey of over 800 shopkeepers and residents in the area, more than 70 percent said they had encountered rodents on the streets between May and August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jennifer Chow, chairwoman of the party's Wan Chai branch, said the three main hotspots identified in the district were Bowrington Road Market, Yat Sin Street and Wing Hing Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some residents saw rats climbing up the pipes into their homes and they were very frightened. We have to do more in terms of cleaning the environment to prevent the rats from going down the street," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hotspots are mostly the back lanes of the private property that is not the government area. So that's the most difficult thing that they face because they don't have any support from the government to clean or to prevent most of the rubbish in their back lane."

 We've heard a lot over the past two weeks about athletes battling it out for the gold medal at the Paris Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  What about ordinary people like you and I?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While our gold medal moments may not involve winning a place on the podium, we've all experienced things in life that made us incredibly happy or proud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK spoke to people in Paris and Hong Kong, and asked them what they felt were their proudest or most joyous moments.
