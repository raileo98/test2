<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate stood unchanged at three percent in the three-month period ending in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.2 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the February-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday showed that about 2,500 people became jobless during the latest period, taking the tally to 116,200, while the number of underemployed people rose by 4,200 to 44,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable increases in the underemployment rate were observed in sectors including decoration, repair, building maintenance, cleaning, arts, entertainment and recreation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total employment, meanwhile, increased by about 2,800 to about 3.69 million, and the labour force also increased by about 5,300 to 3.81 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest data, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said the jobless rate remained low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city's labour market "should stay tight in the near term alongside the continued economic growth".

    Hong Kong embraces ethnic diversity: Eric Chan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan says the government has enhanced support for ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=25&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758296_1_20240620162803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong was a metropolis that embraced ethnic diversity, amid calls for more support for minorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony unveiling the Diversity List, which honoured 21 people with an ethnic minority background for their contributions to the city, Chan said the government had enhanced support for minorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chief Executive, in his Policy Address last year, expanded the government's support for our ethnic minority communities in education, employment, integration into the community and support services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That includes setting up two additional support service centres. Eight ethnic minority care teams will begin service next month, with two others expected to be in place by year’s end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shalini Mahtani, the founder and the CEO of The Zubin Foundation, an NGO which aims to improve the lives of marginalised communities in the city, urged the government to include ethnic minorities in the campaign of "telling the good stories of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To ask the government to use multi-ethnic faces and stories to tell the Hong Kong stories. Because there are so many great stories in this community, and to use these faces and these stories both locally and internationally," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Diversity List, which was launched by The Zubin Foundation, featured 21 people from seven ethnic groups and across a wide range of expertise, such as financial services, legal services and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong-born Saajandeep Singh, who was one of the honourees and an admitted solicitor in the SAR, called on the government to increase the number of ethnic minorities on its care teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the government can always offer more support. They are doing great initiatives at the moment, but obviously they will need to provide more funding to ensure that these programmes continue and they are far-reaching, and they are not only in specific areas of Hong Kong, but they are district-wide," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that they have ethnic minority care teams nowadays, but I think they will need a greater number of people involved in these teams."

    University tuition fees to rise 17.6% over three years
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tuition fees at public universities will increase by HK$2,400 next year, with further rises of around the same amount planned for each of the following two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an almost three-decade-long freeze in annual fees, the current HK$42,100 charge for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will rise to HK$44,500 in 2025/26, HK$47,000 in 2026/27 and HK$49,500 in 2027/28 – an increase of almost 17.6 percent over the three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For sub-degree programmes, the current HK$15,040 will reach HK$17,800 by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson on Thursday said the administration is working to strike a balance between maintaining its fiscal discipline and ensuring that higher education remains affordable for students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the last tuition fees adjustment in the 1997/98 academic year, the Composite Consumer Price Index has increased by 40 percent cumulatively. Comparatively, the tuition fees adjustment is very modest this time," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The UGC-funded universities provide other financial assistance such as scholarships, bursaries and loans to needy students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration also said its target cost recovery rate for tuition fee levels of 18 percent, set in the early 1990s, had been declining due to more expenditure being needed to deliver higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate is projected to drop to 12.5 percent in the next academic year, before improving slightly in 2027 to 13.4 percent following the tuition fee increases, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan stressed that the decision to put up fees has nothing to do with the government's budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't adjusted the tuition fee for more than 20 years, so we believe there is a need to moderately adjust the tuition fee. Our goal is to subsidise students with 82 percent of their tuition fee, but we are above this target," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our plan is to increase the fees in the upcoming three years. We don't have any plan to increase the fees after three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation welcomed the move, while calling for more support for students from lower-income families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 5.5 percent [average annual increase] is somewhat mild, because we are talking about inflation of about two to three percent. We are just slightly above that, trying to catch up a little bit, in terms of the cost recovery," said Victor Kwok, the group's assistant research director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, on the other hand, as they gradually increase the tuition fees, they also have to proportionally increase their support, in terms of students loans, and in terms of student grants, for students from relatively less well-off families."

    Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758281_1_20240620144721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A miniature artist on Thursday said that an exhibition showcasing unique Central and Western District landmarks would deepen people's understanding of Hong Kong's rich history and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Look Closer and Wonder: Central and Western District in Miniature" exhibition will display 22 artworks, with nine pieces new to the collection, in celebration of the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Poon, president of the Joyful Miniature Association, hoped the artworks could give people a fresh perspective of familiar sites in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Central and Western District is very unique. First of all, because it is the heart of Hong Kong's political, economic, financial centre and it's also a cultural centre. From this area, you can see the earliest transportation, colonial architecture and also in terms of food, for example, you have cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong style cafe) and you also have a lot of declared monuments like the Man Mo Temple," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, you have the most classic and oldest [buildings], and on the other hand, you have the highest skyscrapers all at once. It's a melting pot of East meets West. You have Lan Kwai Fong out there, it's the gist of Hong Kong, everything that is the best is here, in Central and Western District."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One artist Hung Fai-chan spent a year recreating the corridors of an old public housing estate called "We All Grew Up Like This". He said he wanted to capture the memories of childhood games, before electronics, that many Hong Kong people grew up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of my own memories inside this piece too because I also grew up in public housing. I have a few siblings myself so I wanted to capture the childhood games we used to play, like rock, paper, scissors up the stairs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also simpler games like marble shooting or even table tennis on the ground. These are all the games we would play as a child, like many children in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another artist Tim Ho worked with a team to recreate the Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan. He said the project was challenging given its meticulous craftsmanship that took numerous site visits and extensive research to create the replica. He added the temple is an iconic landmark, so he hoped a lot of tourists would admire their artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want people to see that it is no different from the actual Man Mo Temple. We tried our best to really capture all the details of the temple. We want people to know that there is such a beautiful piece of architecture in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of our artwork is that it captures an angle you can't see fully in real life. It is usually crowded at the temple so you can't see it when it is empty. You also can't see all the little details. You will see the entire structure from a giant's perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition will be held in Admiralty from June 21 to July 8.

    'HK entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more help'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think tanks on Thursday urged Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more assistance to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation said that as of July 2023, there were 52 entrepreneurial bases in Guangzhou for young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau, with about 2,100 start-up projects underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A research team from the two groups visited two bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou and talked to about 10 Hong Kong entrepreneurs working in various industries there, including arts and culture, technology and catering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s assistant research director, Victor Kwok, said some Hong Kong startups there lack knowledge about the business environment and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are gaps that we observe, such as the difference between the skills, knowledge, experiences and the network of the entrepreneurs and the actual requirements of actually having the business to prosper,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok highlighted challenges arising from changes in rules and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We all know comparatively in the mainland, the policy change is sometimes faster than what is observed in Hong Kong, and that could be a challenge, because sometimes you apply for funding and then the policy itself expires before you actually get the funding,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok said a single, easy-to-use government application or website would be beneficial for entrepreneurs to keep themselves updated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incubators in Guangzhou should also be more proactive in assisting startups to apply for funding from the mainland government, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation and coalition also complained that all the entrepreneurial bases offer identical services. They said authorities should differentiate them based on the startups’ development stage or industry type, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with the right industry players.

    CUHK develops mRNA drug for nasopharyngeal cancer

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758269_1_20240620134352.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists at Chinese University on Thursday said they had developed a new drug that had the potential to cause nasopharyngeal cancer cells to destroy themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drug uses mRNA bio-technology, which acts like a code to activate the death cycle of cancer cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scientists carried out tests on mice and said the results were very promising. They described the drug as a "smart bomb" because it not only targets cancer cells, but also attracts immune cells to help eliminate them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Anne Tsang, one of the researchers, said this new drug is better than current treatments because it could minimise damage to healthy cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the traditional treatments are mostly systemic. They are chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and so they affect not only the cancer cells, but also the other normal cells," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For our drug, this drug mechanism will only target the cancer cells that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. So the normal cells will be safe...and so our human body will feel [many fewer] side effects, and so the patients can have a much better quality of life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the throat, specifically the part that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It is often called "Canton cancer" because it is more common in southern China.

    Health minister concerned about hospital power outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said the hardware of all hospitals needs to be of very high quality, to ensure that patients receive proper treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came after a power outage lasting almost an hour at Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday night. The redeveloped building was only completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff carrying out surgery had to move to another room, while 25 other operations were rescheduled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said there will be a probe into what exactly went wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The quality of construction works and hardware indeed affects our medical services. The Hospital Authority and the hospital will investigate to find out what the problems were technically," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said the problem could be the fault of builders. After the hospital building opened last year, issues with electricity cables were discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not expect a new hospital to have a general power outage problem like that," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is a systematic problem with the engineering system, or the monitoring system while the building was being constructed, then I believe that's a big issue."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice chief Paul Lam said the recent resignations of overseas non-permanent judges from Hong Kong's top court would not undermine the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two UK judges – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Jonathan Sumption – resigned from the Court of Final Appeal earlier this month, and Beverley McLachlin from Canada said she would not stay on when her term expires at the end of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, the secretary for justice said foreign legal experts were still confident in the SAR's judicial system, noting that two other overseas judges had joined the bench since the implementation of the national security law in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's normal for people to come and go. So, don't just focus on people leaving. There are also judges who are extending their terms and new judges who are joining," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the departure of the three judges, seven non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions remain at the Court of Final Appeal. The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there is no quota on the number of overseas non-permanent judges sitting on the top court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Basic Law does not state that there must be eight or 10 non-permanent overseas judges on the court over a long period of time. I think quality is the most important. We are not looking at the numbers. In fact, we invite judges who are internationally prestigious and can help Hong Kong develop what is called jurisprudence, which is the quality of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrests made by the police in the past month over the publishing of social media posts ahead of a "sensitive date" for alleged sedition under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, Lam said the government is not targetting specific dates but the intention of an act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter what day or time it is, if your behaviour constitutes a crime with an incitement intent, then there's a risk you will be charged. We are targetting the words and actions. It doesn't matter what day. The day you come out and say you support 'Hong Kong independence' or want to subvert state power, there's a chance you violate the law," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Elizabeth Hospital said on Wednesday it had launched an investigation after a blunder involving a feeding tube that left a patient fighting for his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said the 61-year-old man was being treated in an orthopaedic ward and required a nasogastric tube to receive formula milk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson said the tube was inserted by a nurse on Sunday at noon and replaced in the evening in accordance with procedures. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated early on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Doctors immediately performed resuscitation and arranged bronchoscopy examination for the patient, where a nasogastric tube was found placed in his bronchus,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient was taken to the High Dependency Unit before being moved to intensive care. On Wednesday, his condition was said to be critical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The hospital is saddened by the incident,” the spokesperson said. “QEH has met with the patient’s family to explain the incident, extend sincere apologies and express deep empathy. QEH will continue to closely communicate with the patient’s family and provide necessary assistance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority. A panel has been set up to investigate and recommend improvements within eight weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Kwong Wah Hospital said that it had called off 25 elective surgeries scheduled for Thursday after a power cut hit some of its operating theatres on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One surgery had to be moved to a different theatre during the cut, which started at 7pm and lasted for 50 minutes. It’s getting in touch with the affect patients and has apologised. Other services were not affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority.

    'Tuition hike moderate but adds to students' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources say university tuition could go up from five to nine percent each year over three years. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758175_2_20240619205709.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A potential increase in university tuition fees has drawn mixed views from students and lawmakers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government intends to roll out a phased fee increase over the next three years, with annual increments ranging from five to nine percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lucy Ng, a third-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said she wants her school to put the money to good use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a student, of course, I hope the school can keep the current tuition fee. But if our school insists to have this increase, I hope they can explain how they will use this fee. Are they going to build any new facilities?" she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another HKU student, Emily, who majors in social work, said a tuition hike would increase the financial burden on students who rely on loans, such as herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm currently taking the government loan... They are burdened with the loans, so they have to repay in many years when they work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will definitely enhance the financial burden of students, so I don't think it's a very good act for the university to increase tuition fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lau Chi-peng, who’s also Associate Vice-President at Lingnan University, described the proposed increase as moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two considerations: whether it would impose a burden on students and families, as well as the magnitude of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears that the increase would be moderate and the process would be gradual. There would also be corresponding adjustments in government financial assistance, which could potentially involve extending the repayment period," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung urged the government to consider the affordability of students and parents before finalising the tuition proposal, to prevent “turning student loans into student debts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Priscilla Leung of the Business and Professionals Alliance, who chairs Legco's education panel, called on society to accept the increase, in light of the government's budget deficit amounting to billions of dollars.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Wildlife officials have captured two wild boars that were spotted wandering around Sham Shui Po on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) used dart guns during the capture operation near Sheung Li Uk Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at around 10.10am when the pigs were seen at the junction of Tai Po Road and Nam Cheong Street, near a petrol station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boars were said to have later moved to the garden, located along Tai Po Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online footage showed police officers at the scene using shields for protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Considering that the presence of the two wild boars in urban areas would pose a danger to the public, our staff captured and euthanised them,” an AFCD spokesperson said.

    Govt moves full steam ahead with new incinerator

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it is working at full speed to get Hong Kong's first mega waste incinerator up and running next year, as it plans to stop using landfills for waste disposal by 2035.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Department led a press tour to a man-made island near Lantau where the incinerator, called I-PARK1, is being built.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Director for Environmental Protection, Michael Lui, said the plant will be able to recover heat energy from the incineration process to generate electricity for 100,000 homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In early next year, we plan to carry out a testing commissioning with a view so that we can operate the plant by the end of next year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we can at least achieve the very important step that we implement the first mega incinerator in Hong Kong to handle at least 3,000 tonnes of waste [each day]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another incinerator, capable of processing about 6,000 tonnes of waste per day, will be built near Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said construction could be completed two years ahead of schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui said both incinerators will use new technology to ensure that emissions meet international standards and do not harm people's health or the surrounding environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the government's plans, an environmental group said burning garbage should be the last resort, and isn't an alternative to reducing waste and increasing recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said opening two massive incinerators risks sending the wrong message to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said Hong Kong currently disposes of around 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste on average per day, and if the goal to gradually reduce the per capita disposal rate by around 45 percent is achieved, the amount would drop to about 6,100 tonnes a day – below the capacity of the two incinerators of 9,000 tonnes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if the government thinks that their strategy action set out in the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035 is useless, otherwise the waste generation amount and the waste that requires disposal will be greatly reduced by 45 percent. This is not by the end of the blueprint timeline 2035, if reduced by 45 percent, it is saying very clearly it is a mid-term target," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means by 2026 or 2027, this is a mid-term, then the government can already get the city to achieve this target. So I don't know why the government still needs to propose even the 6,000 tonnes, the second incinerator, which is really overcapacity."

    Lawmakers bemoan 'useless' workplace accident fines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun said there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents since maximum fines for safety law breaches were introduced last year." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758129_1_20240619153422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies involved in industrial accidents are not being punished strongly enough for safety law breaches despite an increase in the maximum penalty, lawmakers complained on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, the highest penalty for a serious violation of occupational safety laws was raised from a fine of HK$500,000, to HK$10 million and a two-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun said since the law change, there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one case that has concluded, two company bosses were fined HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers said such a punishment is too lenient, with president of the Federation of Trade Unions Stanley Ng saying it shows last year's law change is "useless" when it comes to preventing industrial accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said regarding the pair fined HK$50,000, officials decided they would not have a strong case should they decide to appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is considered the sentences were not wrong in principle and the fines were not manifestly inadequate," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that it has only been a little more than a year since the legal changes were made and appealed to lawmakers to wait longer to see what effect the higher punishments have.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that officials will review the matter in around a year's time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government plans to raise university tuition fees over the coming three years, with annual increases of between five and nine percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi had previously said it was time to raise the HK$42,100 annual tuition fee for local students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions, as it had remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the increase would be phased in as early as next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the current fee covers only 13 percent of the total cost and the government's target is for the fee to cover 18 percent of the cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi met with some lawmakers to explain the plan, with the government expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the number of business outlets remained stable in recent years, despite claims Hong Kong was going through a wave of shop closures due to a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commerce minister Algernon Yau made the comment when responding to a written question from lawmaker Andrew Lam, who noted that netizens had opened a social media group on the closures, with more than 300,000 users joining the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted there were more than 95,000 outlets in the catering, retail, beauty and hairdressing sectors at the end of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of establishments of these industries had once recorded a drop owing to the impact of the epidemic in the last few years, but it has rebounded since the end of 2021 to remain stable with the epidemic subsiding in recent years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials do not keep records of shop openings and closures and that these were business decisions based on a number of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said as small to medium enterprises faced challenges, due to more Hongkongers travelling north of the border to consume, the administration had been providing help through a number of measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include low-interest concessionary loans of nearly HK$19 billion to ensure these companies could maintain steady cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would continue to closely monitor the situation, and help firms "ride out the storm".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ex-husband of a fashion influencer found dead in 2023 was on Wednesday sentenced to 42 months in prison for stealing gold and jewellery worth more than HK$6 million and jumping bail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alex Kwong, ex-husband of Abby Choi, pleaded guilty in the District Court to stealing necklaces, bracelets, pendants, bullion and gold pellets between June 2013 and January 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court heard that Kwong falsely claimed to be engaged in a mainland gold investment business and stole items from six people he persuaded to buy jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on bail following his arrest in 2015, he failed to report to police as instructed and didn't turn up for a court hearing that year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was arrested in February 2023 at a pier in the New Territories while allegedly trying to flee the city by speedboat following Choi's death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong admitted failing to surrender to custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence, Judge David Cheung said Kwong's series of crimes over a period of 1.5 years  was not due to momentary greed, but deliberate action to steal from others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung noted that the defendant had since compensated the victims for their losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong, along with his father and brother are charged with murdering Choi, while Kwong's mother faces a charge of perverting the course of justice in relation to the case.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said it would be difficult for Hong Kong to pursue large-scale production and usage of hydrogen, but the city could act as the mainland's showcase to the international community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, the minister said limited space in Hong Kong made it difficult for the mass production of hydrogen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tse said the SAR could leverage its unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can act as a window, a base for demonstration, to promote hydrogen products overseas. The international community can also come to Hong Kong for financing when it needs to," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hydrogen development is not only for us and helping us to pursue carbon neutrality, but it is also an opportunity for business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced its strategy on hydrogen development, aimed at addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with 14 trial projects in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the administration is now looking into which industries would be suitable and cost-effective to use hydrogen, which is relatively pricey, and will formulate standards and guidelines.

 Hong Kong star swimmer Siobhan Haughey is considered one of Hong Kong's medal favourites in next month's Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She took home two silvers in the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle events in the Tokyo Games, and continued her winning streak at other international swim meets since then.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All eyes are now on whether Hong Kong's "flying fish" can bring home the city's first-ever Olympic swimming gold medal.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Immigration Department says some 180,000 people have not replaced their old smart ID cards, and they're urged to do so as early as possible.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Tuesday said the old form of smart identity cards will be invalidated in 2025 in two phases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  For individuals who were born in 1970 or after, their ID cards will be invalid from May 12 next year; for those born in 1969 or earlier, their ID cards will no longer be valid from October 12, 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This applies to the old form of smart ID cards issued before November 26, 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department noted that some 90 percent of the old ID card holders have already replaced their cards by the end of last month. But some 180,000 people have not yet renewed their cards, possibly because they are working or studying overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They're being urged to do so as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities stressed that the invalidation of the old ID cards will not affect individuals’ permanent residency rights in the SAR.

    MTR upgrades 5G coverage at 24 busy stations

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The upgraded 5G network will be available in 24 MTR stations by the end of 2027. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757994_1_20240618183206.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Tuesday announced that it is working with four mobile network operators to enhance 5G coverage at 24 stations, with an IT expert hailing it a step towards Hong Kong becoming a smart city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a press release, the railway firm said it is installing 3.3 and 3.5 GHz indoor base stations in the 24 stations to provide a faster and smoother mobile service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Upgrading works at Tin Hau station have already been completed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new 5G network will be installed in Wan Chai, Kowloon and Admiralty stations this year, and other stations by the end of 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Francis Fong, honorary president of the Information Technology Federation, called the upgrade a long-awaited move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, there were so many MTR customers complaining about using their mobile data, where the mobile data speed is very slow and [they] always [lose] connection," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think this is something that MTR passengers have been waiting for so long so that they can have a much faster and more stable network in the MTR stations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong added that upgrading the railway infrastructure is an important step to turn Hong Kong into a smart city and an innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Communications Authority also welcomed the move, saying it will "significantly increase the speed and capacity of 5G services along MTR lines".

    Govt to focus talent recruit in Southeast Asia, Europe

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says the government wants to import more care workers from outside of Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758011_1_20240618213154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Tuesday said the government will recruit talent from primarily Southeast Asia and Europe in the coming year, with Malaysia being the first stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Sun spoke about the multilingual skills of Malaysians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are fluent in English, and many also speak fluent Cantonese and Mandarin. There’s a good talent pool and I think it’s worthy for us to give it a try,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During my visits to Southeast Asia, I can tell many people there are eager to come to Hong Kong. But we need to realise that they are not here on travel, they want to work. So if they could be introduced to what to prepare as well as the development opportunities in Hong Kong, that will increase their desire to come to the SAR.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said the government will try to recruit financial and technology talent from Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the welfare chief mentioned a three-year plan to boost the number of care workers in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme to import care workers for residential care homes was rolled out in June last year, and Sun noted that all 7,000 places available under the quota were used up in the first three rounds of applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said after considering factors such as an ageing population and manpower loss, the SAR will need to import 8,000 more care workers over the next three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that the priority is still on local workers. “I understand that many local care workers hope to earn more money and have better promotion opportunities, but fail to do so due to their lower education level,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will study if care workers with less formal education could be promoted, with the emphasis instead on their work experience, Sun added.

    Govt support to get brokers ready for typhoon trades

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Christopher Hui (middle) says there's a "holistic package" of support given to small-sized brokers over arrangements for remote working during severe weather. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757998_1_20240618184720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Small and medium-sized brokers have enough time and support to get themselves ready, officials said on Tuesday, as the financial market is set to remain in operation under severe weather conditions from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The securities and derivatives markets, including northbound and southbound trading, will continue operating during severe weather conditions, while banks and securities dealers will provide electronic services but shut down their physical outlets, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brokers are required to set up a remote office and adopt digital trading by the implementation date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For those failing to meet the requirements, they can assign a small number of staff to return to their workplaces in times of typhoons and heavy rain, in accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Labour Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui said there’s a “holistic package” of support for brokers, especially smaller-sized firms, to put arrangements for remote working in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Technically we have the solutions ready in the market and the HKEx has already set out in the consultation document conclusions that they will provide necessary support in order to connect the potential service providers to the participants if they are needed,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Incentives are being given to the participants to upgrade themselves because for those that cannot do that before the end of September, if they need more time, we will support them through shouldering the relevant clearing responsibilities. At the same time, the regulators will pragmatically deal with their relevant compliance issues if they cannot during that period move everything online."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial services chief said people can draw on the experience of remote working during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Working from home or using technology or online, whatever systems are available to do all the arrangements, it's not something new to the market, and especially during Covid times when already certain members of our financial community are already doing that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So what we are proposing here is not drastic change but rather incremental change which is contingent on experience that we get before.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that tests will be conducted in August to check market readiness, but noting that the official implementation will not be delayed.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The financial industry on Tuesday welcomed the government's move to keep the local stock market open during typhoons and heavy rain storms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's stock market will continue trading under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Robert Lee, who represents the financial services sector, said the new arrangement could enhance Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Lee, who is also a director of the Hong Kong Securities Association, called on authorities to offer more support to small and medium-sized financial institutions to help them adapt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The industry had been expecting it for quite some time now, especially it being mentioned in the Policy Address as well as the Budget. I think international firms and larger scale firms fully support this initiative," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think for some of the SMEs, or the local brokers, I would encourage the SAR government as well as HKEX to provide more assistance to them as they adapt to the new measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan said the industry now had sufficient time to prepare to operate in severe weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now is the right time to implement such kind of arrangement because during the last few years (of the) epidemic situation, a number of electronic trading systems and business solutions have been upgraded," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the implementation time will be this September, now we have sufficient time for us to effectively assist those smaller-scale firms to smoothly transition to the new arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Investment Funds Association and accounting firm KPMG welcomed the new arrangement, saying it would put Hong Kong's bourse in line with other major markets on the mainland and overseas.

    Govt accuses association of 'harbouring fugitives'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has accused a charity that runs a college helping young people quit drugs of harbouring former directors on the police's wanted list.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In January, the authorities arrested four directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others who were not in Hong Kong were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday said narcotics officials have met the association's directors, but the board members' words do not match their actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities questioned the directors' claim that they have cut ties with former college head Alman Chan and founder Jacob Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, the two on the wanted list [Chan and Lam] are still directors of Christian Zheng Sheng Association Ltd and/or Zheng Sheng Charity Fund Limited under the association, and they can even operate the bank accounts under the association and its subsidiary companies," the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the board passed a motion not to recover millions of dollars the college had raised, which the two had allegedly transferred overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this is suspicious, and also shows that the board had no intention of helping students at the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said law enforcement officers will investigate the matter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four varieties of watermelon will be featured at the upcoming Local Organic Watermelon Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event, organised by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, kicks off on Friday at the Maritime Square Farmers Market in Tsing Yi, where people can buy local produce and interact with farmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four varieties featured this year include Super Sweet Black Angel 168, Diana, Huang Yu and seedless 3F-2728.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Mun-wai, an agricultural officer, said people could also purchase local produce through the Local Fresh website and app or through local farmers directly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the festival aimed to promote local agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The festival is to promote the local organic produce, to strengthen the sustainability of local agriculture, and to build a platform for the farmers to connect with the public and share their harvest with the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mrs Liang, a farmer, started growing watermelons last year and used a shed this year to minimise the weather's effects on crops, leading to a better harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that watermelons which were locally produced were fresher compared with imported watermelons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the morning we harvest the watermelons and in the afternoon they will be sold at the festival, so I hope everyone can support us farmers," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed two places to fifth in an annual global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, with an improved economic performance helping the SAR move up the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024 was unveiled by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development on Tuesday, after researchers assessed data from 67 countries and regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list ranked economies based on four main factors: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong returns to fifth place mainly because of improvements in economic performance, business efficiency, and infrastructure. In government efficiency, it slightly drops from second to third," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report attributed Hong Kong's rise in economic performance, from 36th to 11th spot, to "steep increases" in the domestic economy and employment sub-factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city topped the rankings in the international trade and business legislation sub-categories, while placing within the top five in five other areas - international investment, tax policy, finance, basic infrastructure and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the city's economy continued to recover after the pandemic, thanks to the "staunch support" from the central authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also noted the administration had introduced measures to boost market confidence and organised mega events to encourage tourism and spending, while working to attract overseas enterprises and talent to come to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the latest rankings were "a recognition of the brilliant achievements" of the SAR government, alongside local and foreign talent and enterprises, in the city's development and economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said high-quality talent and strategic companies from all over world had "voted with their feet" by coming to Hong Kong to seek opportunities, adding that officials had received more than 300,000 applications to various talent schemes by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people had arrived in Hong Kong, far beyond the initial target of attracting 35,000 per year, Chan added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore returned to the top spot for the first time since 2020, followed by Switzerland and Denmark, which placed first in the previous year's rankings. Mainland China climbed seven spots to place 14th.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The principal of a Wong Tai Sin school which is set to close in two years says she welcomes the Education Bureau’s decision to step in, adding that she hopes the bureau will clarify what a "management failure" means.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday evening, the bureau announced it will appoint managers to Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, citing a "management failure" at the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's sponsoring body – the Confucian Academy – said over the weekend that the school will cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's principal, Yuen Poon Suk-han, told reporters on Tuesday that the academy is to blame for not consulting everyone involved regarding the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is the Confucian Academy fails to conduct extensive consultations with various stakeholders on the plan. So I hope the Education Bureau will clarify what management failure means, to prevent some people from making a big fuss and misleading the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents told RTHK they are disappointed by the closure and hope the government can provide help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My kids study in an English class. You know there are not many English primary schools available. The ones I can find are mostly Chinese primary schools. I asked my kids whether it's possible to switch back to a Chinese primary school and they said they are worried they can't handle it," said one parent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A primary five pupil said he hopes the closure can be delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm a bit unhappy. I wish the school could wait a few more years, maybe five, before closing down... I think the school offers a learning environment that other schools can't provide, because there are many recreational facilities," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors will still be able to trade in the city's financial market under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee made the announcement ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, saying Hong Kong has no valid reason to stop the financial market operating during severe weather conditions, when other major financial hubs are able to continue trading in such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other securities markets around the world such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, they maintain trading even under severe weather conditions. Hong Kong is the only exception. Hong Kong is an international financial centre and there is no reason for us not to align with international standards," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the move would consolidate the competitiveness of HKEx and raise Hong Kong's role as a trading corridor with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing a public consultation exercise carried out by HKEx, Lee said about 90 percent of brokerages and banks support keeping the financial market open under severe weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the implementation date in late September will give the trade enough time to prepare, and the relevant authorities will offer support to small brokerages to cope with the change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says airport officials followed their contingency procedures to handle an emergency that closed a runway for hours on Monday, with a plane operator asked to submit a report to the authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after a cargo plane experienced a flat tyre during an emergency landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive on Tuesday said the authorities kept the public informed, made alternative transport and flight arrangements, and brought in extra manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the plane's operator has been told to submit a report on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a believer that, for any matter, there's always room for improvement. I'm glad that the incident was handled safely. That is the most important principle in any emergency incident, that's the number one priority," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will scrutinise reports and see whether any extra action can be taken by the airline, by the [Airport Authority] and other parties concerned."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that similar incidents could be dealt with more efficiently in the future when the airport's third runway is fully in operation at the end of this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Monday said it will appoint managers to the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, which is set to close in two years, citing ineffective management at the institution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sponsoring body of the Wong Tai Sin school – the Confucian Academy – announced over the weekend that the school would cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press conference on Monday, the school's principal Yuen Poon Suk-han said she and the management committee were not consulted on the academy's decision to suspend the school beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the academy said the school's chancellor had informed its managers and principal in April, and that the decision was "carefully considered".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the bureau said it had met with the school's principal and sponsoring body multiple times and that the two parties had failed to reach a consensus on a transition plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it will appoint managers to the school to ensure that it is managed properly and that the closure aligns with existing mechanisms and procedures.

    Govt announces strategy on hydrogen development

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced its strategy on hydrogen development, saying it is to address climate change and help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony, officials said 14 trial projects are in the pipeline, such as using hydrogen to power street-cleaning vehicles and to generate electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the strategy is an important milestone that will help build a carbon-free city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we are pursuing carbon neutrality, it is necessary for us to acquire what we call the zero-carbon energy in order to support the green transition. Hydrogen is one of the zero-carbon energies,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe that hydrogen has a great potential to develop a new green economy in Hong Kong, because its production, its storage and also its application in different sectors will enhance the employment of labour and the setting up of new industry,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that changes to the law will be proposed in the first half of next year to ensure safe storage and supply of the highly combustible gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR already has a hydrogen double-decker bus and the MTR will trial a hydrogen-powered light rail vehicle later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday afternoon said that the north runway at Chek Lap Kok was up and running again after a cargo plane, that had burst a tyre, was towed away at around 3 pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jet made an emergency landing at around 7:30 am, forcing the closure of the runway for almost eight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one runway remained in operation, and around 450 flights were delayed as a result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers said their itineraries were badly affected, with some complaining that they had missed their onward connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said even though both runways had since resumed operation, some flights could still be disrupted as a backlog was being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged passengers to keep tabs on the latest flight information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Monday evening the Airport Authority said the Airport Express Link would run more frequently after midnight, with the last train to Hong Kong Station departing at 1:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said the airport's Automated People Mover System and customer service counters would stay open until 3 am.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Monday said tourists made nearly 3.4 million trips to Hong Kong in May, a 20 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said initial figures show that some 2.6 million trips were made by mainlanders, which was a 15 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trips by travellers from outside the mainland jumped by some 43 percent, to more than 771,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cumulatively, a total of 18 million visitors arrived in Hong Kong from January to May this year, increasing by 80 percent from the same period last year," the board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The border between Hong Kong and the mainland fully reopened in early February last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the DAB said Hong Kong can consider making use of its culture of martial arts novels and TV series to attract tourists, together with fellow Greater Bay Area cities like Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party vice-chairman Holden Chow told reporters the SAR can think about hosting activities around "intangible assets", like novels written by the late Jin Yong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they are still very attractive to many people around the world, including those from South East Asia.

    No civil servant tests on security laws: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ingrid Yeung told lawmakers there will be national security training, but not examinations, for new and existing government workers." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757780_1_20240617140633.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said there are no plans to test government workers on how familiar they are with national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of tests was brought up by lawmakers at a Legco panel meeting to discuss the updated Civil Service Code, which sets resolutely safeguarding national security as a core value of government staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said there will be plenty of national security training for new and existing government workers, but not examinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Training is about integrity and attitude. You can't really test that in an examination," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, you can ask them to quote many examples, but can they actually deliver? That's more important. That's why we will assess their day-to-day performance and their conduct as we appraise colleagues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The updated code also states that in their official capacity, civil servants cannot criticise any government policies or support opposing views, and they must be loyal to the chief executive of the day and the Central People's Government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Siu-chung, from the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, asked for clarity on this, saying it's hard to know when someone is speaking whether it's in their official or personal capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that if government workers are not allowed to make public criticism in a personal capacity, it may not be good for overall governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said this is something for civil servants to work out for themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that if a policy is in the consultation stage, government workers can speak more freely, but once a decision is made they should be extra careful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same meeting, lawmakers also discussed a planned across-the-board three percent pay rise for civil servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung dismissed a claim from the federation's Lam Chun-sing that the government has been under pressure from employers to keep rises in check, so that private sector staff don't demand bigger increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister reiterated that the latest pay decision was made based on several factors, including the government's budget deficit.

    Consumer watchdog warns of hidden fees at pet hotels

<div class="itemFullText">
 Pet owners should study the fine print carefully when choosing a lodging for their furry friends and avoid those which are unlicensed, according to the Consumer Council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council randomly selected 18 licensed pet hotels across Hong Kong for study earlier this year. Only five had their fee structures published online, meaning consumers had to make enquiries, a process which could be tedious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different operators also had varying charging schemes. Some charged up to double the normal rate during peak periods such as the Lunar New Year holiday, while the administering of medicines or nutritional supplements all came at a cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the event of injury, illness or even death, only four hotels would provide compensation of between HK$300 and HK$5,000. Eight others stated they would assume no legal liability through disclaimers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart form urging pet hotel operators to be more transparent in their fee structures, the watchdog also hoped the government could amend the rules so that all licensed animal boarding providers were published on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the council conducted a survey of private camping sites in Hong Kong and found that nearly 40 percent of them were suspected of operating illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only three of the 22 venues covered in the study carried a proper licence or compliance certificate to operate a holiday camp. Authorities were verifying if any operator had breached rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also studied another seven "glamping" sites which provide extra amenities. Only three were covered by third-party liability insurance, meaning people staying at other sites may not have adequate protection in case of emergencies or accidents.

    Government plans to raise university tuition fees

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Monday said the government plans to raise university tuition fees in the next few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local undergraduate students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions pay an annual tuition fee of HK$42,100 – an amount that has remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Choi said a fee increase for such students will be implemented in stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After all these years... there's been 40 percent inflation, but we haven't raised tuition fees at all. So we think it's time for a review and to maintain fiscal discipline," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the government will make an announcement in advance so that universities can introduce more grants and bursaries for students in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the minister said she expects more institutions to offer applied degree programmes that combine theory and practical skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his policy address last year to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and to facilitate the establishment of universities of applied sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that each university has its own strengths, so there should be a division of labour regarding the courses they offer in the future.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of rush-hour commuters had to be evacuated from an MTR train on Monday morning, after a 40-centimetre snake was seen slithering through one of the carriages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they were notified at around 7:30am that a black and white snake was spotted on a Tsuen Wan Line train that was approaching Admiralty station from Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All passengers were asked to disembark at Admiralty, and no one was injured in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A snake catcher was called in soon after, and the serpent – believed to be a nonvenomous California Kingsnake – was captured and sent to Kadoorie Farm.

    Better labelling for air purifiers needed: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called on manufacturers of air purifiers to clearly indicate how much clean air their products can deliver per minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said clearly stating the clean air delivery rate would help buyers make better choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council tested 10 air purifiers, and found big differences in their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best performing model was 12.3 times better than the worst at removing formaldehyde, while variations in their effectiveness in removing smoke ranged up to 2.7 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said the clean air delivery rate could act as a convenient metric for consumers to compare different air purifier models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because the standards of filtration is quite different among different countries, no matter it is dust or pollens or cigarette smoke, it's quite diverse,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is easier for consumers to compare based on the CADR - the clean air delivery rate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health reminded consumers to clean their purifiers regularly to minimise the risk of diseases, while the Hong Kong Medical Association reminded people to maintain air circulation by keeping windows open to ensure indoor air quality.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said on Monday morning there could be disruptions to flights in and out of Hong Kong for a few hours due to the closure of the north runway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The closure followed an emergency landing by a cargo plane at around 7:30am, during which the jet experienced a flat tyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said only one runway remained in operation for the time being, and flights schedules may be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on passengers to watch out for the latest flight information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of erectile dysfunction pills, anti-depressants and other psychotropic drugs have been seized in Hong Kong this month with four people arrested on suspicion of running a medication mail service without a permit, customs officers said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 1.4 million pills, found in a remote village house in Mui Wo and at a subdivided factory unit in San Po Kong, are believed to be worth around HK$80 million in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the hauls mostly comprised of generic drugs from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's believed the pills were being posted to dozens of places around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior customs investigator, Hong Yan, said they were looking into whether the two cases are linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that the two syndicates operate in a very similar fashion. They both rented a unit as a centre for packaging and storing the medicines," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They also hired foreigners to package and post the medicines overseas. Furthermore, inside the units, the ways the drugs were categorised and stored were very similar."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said two women arrested in Mui Wo at the start of the month had since been released on bail, while two women arrested in San Po Kong were still in detention.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fifteen men and five women have been arrested on suspicion of loan sharking and illegal debt collection, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that during an operation, officers seized HK$300,000 in cash, bank cards, phones, computers and debt collection notes, as well as cars and watches suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said more than a million dollars was loaned to nine people in Sau Mau Ping in recent months, and a group threatened and harassed those who failed to repay the money on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our intelligence indicated that the syndicate used various illegal debt collecting methods, including splashing red paint to debtors’ flats, damaging the door locks and criminal intimidation to force the debtors to repay their loans,” said Inspector Leung Ho-ching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police added that they have identified a bank account linked to the case that was allegedly used to launder at least HK$5.8 million.

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=45&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757666_1_20240616155357.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said a survey it has carried out suggests the majority of people living in poor housing support the government's goal of ridding the city of low-quality subdivided units, but they're also concerned about where they would move to if it happens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Caritas Community Development Service said it spoke to 231 tenants of subdivided flats and cubic apartments from December to April, and found that 70 percent think the government should regulate low-quality subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 60 percent said they worry they wouldn't be able to find an affordable home if such a move was taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They think that if the government takes the action to regulate subdivided housing, it means that there would be fewer subdivided flats in the urban areas. So they may need to afford a higher rent, and they may not find suitable units," said Kelvin Lee, a social worker with the NGO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units has been asked to come up with proposals on minimum living standards for such homes, as well as how those that are substandard can be eradicated altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, officials announced that applications for Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing will open from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said single non-elderly people are less likely to secure a place under a points system that prioritises families living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social worker added that building more public housing is the long-term solution to the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to consider using the vacant land reserve to build more public housing, especially in the urban areas, since most of the low-income talents are living in those urban areas, which is near their jobs and schools for the children," Lee said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Some food vendors in Kowloon City say they want to move back to the neighbourhood after a revamp. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757649_1_20240616122050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Sunday said more than half of shop operators it spoke to in Kowloon City want to move back to the neighbourhood after a makeover designed to beautify the area and preserve its culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing project, covering three sections of Carpenter Road and Nga Tsin Wai Road, will see the Kowloon City wet market relocated and some of its surrounding areas demolished to make way for more than 4,000 new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, wrote on his blog that the URA held 15 meetings with wet market food vendors and Thai restaurant operators to brief them on relocation and transitional arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They shared with the team that they have been doing business in the 'Dragon City' district for many years and are attached to the district, hoping to pass on the friendship," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some operators also hope to pass on the regional characteristics to the next generation through the relocation arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said the authority will reserve some shops for these vendors after the area is rebuilt and offer concessionary rent for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA earlier said it hopes the new Kowloon City Market can be completed by 2030 while most of the other proposed facilities can be ready by 2037.

 The first overnight high-speed trains from Beijing and Shanghai to Hong Kong arrived on Sunday morning, with tourism minister Kevin Yeung saying passengers were generally positive about the “sleep and arrive” arrangement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung and MTR CEO Jacob Kam welcomed passengers at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and handed out souvenirs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism chief said passengers told him they thought it was good to be able to sleep on the train and arrive refreshed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe it provides an extra option. In the past, most travellers from Shanghai and Beijing would choose to take a plane. Even if they took high-speed trains, that would be during daytime,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now that the option of taking an overnight train is available, passengers can make better use of their time. They can sleep on the train and when they arrive in Hong Kong in the morning they can do the things they want. They have a whole day to travel.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger from Shanghai, who brought his son along to experience a sleeper train for the first time, said he was satisfied with the facilities, but his son had trouble sleeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The noise level is a bit high. Otherwise it's quite good. There's no problem for an individual to fall asleep. During the trip the train passed through some tunnels that generated a big noise," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kam said while demand for the first few trains was really positive, it is still too early to discuss the possibility of increasing the frequency of services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to consider the passenger needs and the needs for various destinations. Also we need to consider that the sleeper trains pass through various railway tracks and they require maintenance. We need to strive a balance between maintenance work and the passenger need,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first Beijing-bound sleeper train from Hong Kong arrived in the capital on Sunday morning. Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, said he really enjoyed his meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I had grilled beef with king trumpet mushroom rice. The portion of the beef is quite large and there are many varieties of the side dishes. There are vegetables, meat and sauce, and the rice is also warm. Therefore I highly recommend it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he was not worried that the new services will encourage more tourists not to stay in a hotel when they visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four sleeper trains run every Friday to Monday night, with two travelling from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Beijing and two going in the opposite direction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong officials on Sunday celebrated Father's Day by sharing stories about them and their children, as they wished all dads a good day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee posted a photo online of a card his son made him decades ago when he nominated him for a "top ten modern day father" award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he felt warm and proud to see it again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife had written a message on the card saying "although he is very busy with work, he spends time every week chit-chatting with me. He also encouraged me to take part in more community work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said it was unfortunate he couldn't attend the fathers' award ceremony at the time because of work, and nowadays he also loses time with his family because he is busy in the office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee thanked his family for supporting him so he can focus on work and make good policies for the people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he spent the weekend playing football with several fathers and their sons, saying many fathers are often too busy to play with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan wrote on his weekly blog that the government has been putting a lot of resources into sports facilities in recent years, from five-a-side football pitches to the Kai Tak Sports Park, which will be the biggest ever sports infrastructure project in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the park is due to open in the middle of next year and said it should hopefully bring business opportunities as well as spectacular sport and other performances for locals and tourists alike.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a case of suspected mad honey poisoning, after a 35-year-old man became dizzy and started vomiting about half an hour after eating the honey on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The following day he went to the accident and emergency department at Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted with low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. He is in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mad honey poisoning is caused by ingestion of honey containing grayanotoxins derived from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family - including rhododendrons, a CHP spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enquiries show the patient had consumed honey mailed to Hong Kong by a friend from Nepal. Investigations are ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first high-speed sleeper train from Hong Kong to Beijing departed on Saturday evening, with the transport minister calling the new overnight services a "breakthrough".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, also said the administration would look to see whether it was possible to increase the number of sleeper trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we get four days of sleeper services. But it depends on how it goes. And I would say that if it is welcomed by the general public, we'll push for more," he told reporters prior to departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The train for Beijing left at 6.24 pm on Saturday, and passengers will arrive at their destination about half a day later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy and excited that I can take the first train to Beijing. I haven't been to Beijing for a long while. I'll be able to see the bustle and the prosperity of our nation's capital," a lady surnamed Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This train is really good. It is fast. I only need to sleep one night and then I will arrive when I wake up. It saves a lot of time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service was among the travel agencies allotted tickets for the trip. Its managing director, Chen Rui-dong, said all of its 35 tickets were quickly snapped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the chief executive's announcement, the tickets were sold out in half a day. We hope that there will be more sleeper train services in future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sleeper train bound for Shanghai was set to depart from Hong Kong at 7.49 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new regular services, which will have trains running between Friday and Monday, trips from Hong Kong's West Kowloon terminus will take about 12.5 hours to get to Beijing, and around 11 hours to Shanghai.

    Heavy rain fails to dampen dragon boat race enthusiasm

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

    Singles not ruled out of LPH, says Winnie Ho

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing secretary Winnie Ho has played down suggestions that people who are single will be less likely to secure a Light Public Housing unit under a points system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Applications for the first batch of the modular temporary housing flats in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long begin on June 24. Only those who have been on the waiting list for public rental housing for at least three years can apply, and they will remain on the public housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the points system, families living in poor conditions, households with infants and the elderly, and people with disabilities would be given extra marks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, the minister said single-person households still have a chance for a light public housing unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entire social structure is centred on the family. Families take care of elderly people and children. They often have greater burdens and face situations which are more complex. So it's designed with families in mind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individuals, who are single, can still apply for light public housing because they can still qualify in certain circumstances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the majority of flats designed for one or two people, Ho said the provision of different home sizes was based on an earlier study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two people could already be considered to be a family. There are also households that have a single parent with a child. They are two people and that's a small family," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to results from a study on subdivided flats in 2021, around 70 percent are households with one or two people. Households of three, four or more accounted for 30 percent. So based on this ratio, and because our measure is aimed at taking care of people living in such conditions, the design is based on the actual situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With regard to the recent government clamp down on better-off people taking advantage of public housing, the minister said 14 tenants, who had failed to return a declaration form to authorities, would be told to vacate their units. They were among the first batch of 88,000 public housing tenants required to make declarations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for a second group of 250,000 tenants told to make declarations, Ho said more than 90 percent had returned their forms, while officials had repossessed around 1,400 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Ho said a task force on subdivided units would submit a report in August after collecting views on the matter. She said some had suggested such flats should be a minimum of seven to 10 square metres in size.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government remains committed to large-scale developments despite challenges brought about by the geopolitical and economic situation, a top adviser for Chief Executive John Lee has said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Wong, who heads the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, also said the city's leader hoped the administration would work more closely with the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't underestimate the challenges... but also, on balance, we are very optimistic and we obviously have faith in the future, which is why the government is committed to large-scale developments, for example, in San Tin, a science and tech city, and the Northern Metropolis," Wong told RTHK's Your Home Address programme on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are big developments that are saying that we have faith in our future. We trust that the future will bring further development to Hong Kong. So I think as long as there's a capable government that works closely with society, with the efficient market, then we can bring opportunities to a very special place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Wong was appointed the head of the policy unit, which serves as a think-tank for the Chief Executive in formulating policies by conducting research and gathering opinions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday expressed strong dissatisfaction and rejected criticism from the United States and  other Western countries over Hong Kong's decision to revoke the passports of six people accused of national security crimes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said in a statement that people who threaten national security often flee to other countries and continue to pose a threat to national security in various ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People who endanger national security often abscond overseas to avoid criminal liability and continue to endanger national security through various means, such as colluding with forces outside Hong Kong to put pressure on the central government and the Hong Kong government, or setting up organisations to endanger national security outside Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The measures taken against the fugitives are aimed at combating, deterring and preventing such conduct and facilitating their return to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said that the United States and other Western countries have made false and irresponsible statements to confuse the public.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday said a woman is in critical condition in intensive care with botulism after receiving botox injections at a beauty clinic in Zhuhai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre said the 57-year-old woman, who was in good health, received the jabs between April 27 and May 15. About three days after the final shot, her speech became slurred and she had difficulty swallowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CHP said she was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on May 22 but was discharged, against medical advice, the same day. The following day she was admitted again to Queen Mary after her symptoms worsened and then discharged two days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, she was admitted to intensive care at Tseung Kwan O Hospital due to a shortage of breath, choking, and limb weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre says Botox, or botulinum toxin, injections should only be prescribed and performed by registered doctors. It said the case had been reported to mainland authorities.

    Govt confident in Kai Tak park transport facilities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Friday said he's confident transport facilities would be able to cope with crowds heading to and from the Kai Tak Sports Park, as there will be various modes of transport to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An inter-departmental working group held its first meeting on Friday, and Chan said the main facilities of the park would be completed by the end of this year, and would open to the public in the first half of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main stadium of the park can accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, and Chan said transport facilities, including the nearby Sung Wong Toi and Kai Tak MTR stations, would be able to cater all of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there are large-scale events, we will increase the frequency of MTR trains to boost passenger capacity. We will also arrange taxis and buses. People can also walk further to other stations, like Choi Hung MTR Station. We are confident that order will be maintained," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that authorities were planning test runs ahead of the park's opening, and they would simulate a crowd of people leaving the park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about noise complaints after a recent music festival, Chan said the main stadium of the sports park has a retractable roof, and authorities would conduct noise assessments to ensure it meets proper standards.

    Time for Hong Kong to diversify portfolio: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong must not put all its eggs in one basket and should step up efforts to explore new market opportunities, according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that despite high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, the SAR's economy was on target to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the full year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau felt there was a need for businesses to diversify their investment portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are seeing many opportunities around, especially in new economies in central Asia, central Europe, eastern Europe," he told reporters at a press event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed he was planning an upcoming duty visit to Peru in November, while there are plans to set up government outposts in Egypt and Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be helping the motherland for inviting investment from all those new economies using Hong Kong as a gateway into the mainland," Yau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event to promote Hong Kong's industries, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said a sprawling technology park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop is going ahead full steam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed that the first three buildings within the park would be completed later this year, and authorities were still deciding how to carve out 87 hectares of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The park will be developed in two phases - the western side will provide around one million square metres of office space for different sectors such as artificial intelligence," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will also be accommodation and ancillary facilities for professionals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The I&T minister had previously said that dozens of tech enterprises had expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics sectors.

    GBA has edge over San Francisco in finance: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub has provided a "competitive advantage" to the Greater Bay Area in financial services over its counterpart in San Francisco, according to the financial chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One distinctive feature of the SAR, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a media interview, was the opportunity for companies to list on the city's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have Hong Kong, in the Greater Bay Area, being an international financial centre. We can marry both technological innovation and financial services to prosper. And this is the distinction between Hong Kong and San Francisco," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you want to develop and grow the innovation and technology sector, you need a lot of capital... But also you need to have an [international financial centre], a listing platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, Chan said there were similarities between the two bay areas in southern China and California, with the two being "economic powerhouses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign investment to the Greater Bay Area, the financial chief said the SAR remained attractive and competitive amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given this geopolitical tension, the capital market would be more volatile. Certain funding, say for example, funding from the US, may reduce their allocation to this part of the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in our engagement with the investing sector in the US, they are still very keen in the Greater Bay Area and the development of China, because they believe this is the growing future. And using the Greater Bay Area is not just for the Chinese market, but also for the Asia market as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said local authorities were working hard to reach out to the international community and host mega events to clear up misunderstandings about the city, while also bringing about more than HK$10 billion into the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief also said the number of arrivals this year had risen thanks to the expansion of the solo travel scheme, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis instead of in tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combined with a rise in consumption, hopes of lower interest rates in the near future, and the resumption of international flights, Hong Kong's economy is estimated to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's property prices, which plunged by almost a quarter from its historic high in September 2021 to February this year, Chan said it's normal for housing costs to adjust amid high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed out that both home prices and the number of transactions had risen after the government scrapped all property-cooling measures in February.

    CE confident in GBA opportunities

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

    Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday brushed aside lawmakers' concerns that banning vaping and flavoured cigarettes would make Hong Kong a less attractive destination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government last week put forward 10 measures to cut the number of smokers in the city, including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Starry Lee said Hong Kong would be less competitive when compared with other international financial centres which allow smoking, such as London, while retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the ban would discourage travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lo said people did not come to Hong Kong just to smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most tourists who come to Hong Kong are non-smokers. Non-smokers always outnumber smokers. When they come to Hong Kong, they don't come to Hong Kong just to smoke. They come to Hong Kong to identify business opportunities. They want to experience our culinary experiences, tourism experiences, and so on,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So when we have a tobacco-free, vibrant, and healthy Hong Kong, it’s always better to have a city that is [free] of smoke.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers also raised concerns about the limitations in enforcement, with election committee sector lawmaker Chan Pui-leung saying there were staff shortages at the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, and the definition of a queue was ambiguous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, catering sector lawmaker Tommy Cheung said the government should allocate more resources to educate the youth about the dangers of smoking, rather than solely focusing on banning cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister explained that creating a tobacco-free Hong Kong would require more than just enforcement efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In fact, it's not just about relying on law enforcement, but also about using certain enforcement measures to establish a culture, a norm, so that everyone will know in which areas smoking is prohibited. It can also be said that everyone is a smoking control ambassador.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.

    ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757423_1_20240614141154.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC has arrested 20 people in connection with an alleged vehicle-testing scam.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body accused staff of a designated private testing centre of accepting advantages from garage proprietors or middlemen, and helping private cars that did not meet the required standards to pass the exhaust emission test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested were staff of a designated testing centre, owners of three garages in the New Territories, middlemen as well as contract workers of the Transport Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten private cars were also seized in the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the Transport Department’s requirements, all private cars manufactured for over six years must undergo an annual examination at designated test centres in order to renew their vehicle licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The genuine fee for the examination is HK$585. What was happening was that the owners were paying a one-stop shop price for all the service. That was between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000,” said ICAC principal investigator David Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the difference between those two prices is the benefits that were made for both parties in either the garage owner would get business from the customers or the testing centre staff would be receiving some of that in bribery money.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams said staff at the testing centre substituted the results of cars that they knew would fail with those that had already passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said about 20 cars were referred by the garages to pass the examination fraudulently every month, and it's still trying to find out how long the syndicate has been in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Transport Department said it was very concerned about the incident and would cooperate with the ICAC in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said vehicle testing at the centre has been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would strengthen the management and supervision of vehicle testing centres as advised by the ICAC.
