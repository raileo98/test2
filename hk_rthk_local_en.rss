<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Wednesday said they had arrested 44 people in an operation targeting illegal workers and the use of e-bikes for delivery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This includes 36 non-Chinese who hold temporary identification documents which bar them from working.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seven account holders were also arrested for providing their accounts to the illegal workers, so that they could take orders or deliver takeaway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also found that the arrested account holders come from the same place as the deliverymen, or are their friends, and that they had lent out their accounts," said Senior Inspector Lam Tsz-lin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police revealed that delivery platforms had agreed to terminate riders' accounts if workers were found to have committed illegal acts, including the use of e-bikes or seriously breaching traffic regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities also reached out to building management offices to remind security guards to register the couriers' information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said security staff should contact police immediately if the deliverymen do not have ID cards.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) on Wednesday unveiled details of the inaugural Hong Kong Shopping Festival which aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) expand their reach in the mainland's e-commerce market.
 <br>
  <br/>
  With the mainland's online retail sales hitting 15.4 trillion renminbi (US$2.12 trillion) in the past year – a year on year increase of 11 percent – the festival provides an opportunity for Hong Kong businesses to tap into the booming market, allowing SMEs to leverage extensive visitor traffic and diverse customer bases to enhance their visibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will feature over 230 brands offering discounts across categories such as apparel, food, personal care products and more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKTDC Assistant Executive Director Stephen Liang said the initiative will provide SMEs with practical experience in navigating the mainland's e-commerce landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a very good opportunity for [SMEs] to learn about how the mainland e-commerce operates and at the same time introduce them to more KOLs to create exposure," Liang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The festival will take place for the entire month of August and will include large digital promotions on platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin, as well as live-stream events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the mainland e-commerce platforms, they have different ways to market their products, they use different slogans ... and different ways to drive traffic," said Liang.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong on Wednesday hailed a new partnership between the Hong Kong Science Park and Oscar-winning visual effects production company Digital Domain as a "significant milestone in digital entertainment" and a huge boost to the SAR's creative sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Digital Domain, which has won 11 Academy Awards, including three "Best Visual Effects", and eight "Scientific and Technical Achievement" Oscars, will establish an AI research centre at the park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The studio has produced visual effects for numerous Hollywood movies over the past decades, including “Titanic”, "What Dreams May Come”, and “Spider-Man: No Way Home”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the centre's establishment ceremony on Wednesday, Sun emphasised that AI had transformed the way movies, animations, and visual effects were made, and believed the partnership would revolutionise the SAR's entertainment industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Digital Domain is a testament to this, with its groundbreaking use of AI technology as a tool for better storytelling and immersion. By harnessing the power of AI, we can create truly exceptional products that push the boundaries of imagination," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is the future we envision for the film and entertainment industry, where humans and AI work hand-in-hand to create unforgettable experiences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology minister also interacted with a lifelike AI-generated image of the late singer Teresa Teng during a demonstration session.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said the SAR government was well-prepared for the opportunities and challenges arising from AI and would offer all sorts of support to develop the technology in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Digital Domain’s CEO Daniel Seah said he dreams of building a “Hollywood of China” in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe we can help the Hong Kong film market...over the past 30 years we have accumulated lots of data and digital assets. All these will be used in machine learning and deep learning in the research centre at Science Park,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have the ability and resources to bring back amazing films here.”

    Help young people contribute to society: Third Side

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Third Side on Wednesday called for Chief Executive John Lee to introduce new ways for young people to contribute to society in his policy address later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We encourage the government to open up more opportunities, and in other social activities, encourage them and give them some support and subsidy, encourage them to design some creative activities, and through social activities, engage the young people in community affairs," the party's chairman Tik Chi-yuen said on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party called for vouchers for those aged 16 to 35 to buy tickets for events or to take part in cultural activities, as well as for HK$100 million to be spent each year on paying for young artists to develop businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side also called for universal suffrage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the Basic Law, the Central government promised direct elections for CE and Legislative Council members. We are looking for democracy in Hong Kong. This is also the responsibility of the SAR government. Like Article 23, they take up the responsibility to create the atmosphere to allow the movement of democracy in Hong Kong," Tik said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that people's livelihoods, economic development and democracy complement each other.

    'More support needed for ethnic minority elderly'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The HKCS says more resources should be put into making mainstream care services more accessible for elderly people who come from ethnic minority groups. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=30&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762958_1_20240724150608.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS) on Wednesday said more than half of ethnic minority carers lack confidence in mainstream care services, according to its survey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The organisation conducted the survey from November to April this year, and collected 250 questionnaires, 200 from elderly folk and 50 from carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With 10 being the highest confidence level, over half of ethnic minority carers gave only 1 to 5 to mainstream care services. Almost 90 percent of elderly and carers have never used mainstream care services which are mainly provided by the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Viola Tsang, HKSC's service head, said this was worrying especially given the population of  ethnic minority elderly people in Hong Kong was expected to increase by 160 percent, according to population census data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jackie Chan, supervisor of HKCS's Centre for Research & Development, said that among the small 10 percent who had used mainstream services, almost 30 percent said the language barrier was very problematic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This sentiment was echoed by Nanda, a 33-year-old Nepali women, who said that notices should be offered in English as well, especially for important information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang added that pre-existing translation copies were not sufficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More audio broadcasts or even to translate the public information into easy-to-read and simple ways in different ethnic languages is also very helpful for them to access the public service."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other recommendations by HKCS include more bridging services, multicultural sensitivity training for mainstream care providers, and an ethnic minority specialised team with more ethnic minority staff.

    Hong Kong should develop e-sports: lawmakers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 C15+ lawmakers on Wednesday urged the government to develop e-sports as part of their suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices, lawmaker William Wong called on the authorities to consider giving e-sports "elite sport" status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that Hong Kong gamers secured a silver medal in an e-sports event at the Hangzhou Asian Games last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been doing well in the Asian Games… but when we do our research, we've realised that the parents are actually undermining a little bit about the potential of the sport itself. So I think the first thing the government has to do is to change the image of e-sports and preferably, at some point in time, actually make e-sports as one of the elite sports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the gaming industry benefits the city’s economy, adding that the sector is projected to generate US$1.8 billion in income by 2027, up from US$1.4 billion in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, lawmaker Andrew Lam urged the CE to use Hong Kong's intangible heritage to promote tourism and boost the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I particularly mentioned about the conservation of our countryside, revitalisation of our villages. Because actually it's the best kind of real experience, apart from the very busy urban area that tourists and also our local visitors could have a deeper understanding and appreciation of our cultural origin. It's not just about Hong Kong, it's also about Chinese story," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third policy address in October.

    Lawmaker calls for longer transitional site tenancies

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Andrew Lam says many transitional housing residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762901_1_20240724095341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Andrew Lam is calling on the government to make sure transitional housing projects can remain on their sites for longer, saying many residents fear having to move back into inadequate housing, like subdivided flats, once the tenancy is up.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam made the comment after commissioning a survey of residents who had moved from inadequate housing to transitional housing. He said half of those surveyed feared returning to inadequate housing and this was alarming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All this transitional housing is run by NGOs on temporary allocation of land. So the original policy is that this housing will cover five to a maximum of seven years," Lam said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Including the construction period... a lot of them only have three years' operation time so that's the key problem with the transitional housing arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam believes the situation is slightly better for light public housing but that a lot of these sites were a kind of charity by landowners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has been promoting transitional housing development through the use of short-term vacant land and premises. In 2020, the Housing Bureau set up a scheme to support transitional housing projects by NGOs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Light public housing is more government-driven and uses both government and private land. The modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address, are also designed to house those on the public rental housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of both transitional housing and light public housing remain on the public rental housing list as before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he commissioned an independent company for his survey and that it covered 14 operating transitional housing estates. He said there were over 350 responses.

    Security beefed up in Paris ahead of Olympics

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Paris Olympics are just around the corner and authorities in France are not taking any chances on security, as the national terrorist alert remains at the highest level.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police from France and dozens of other countries, alongside local security personnel, have been deployed to patrol major landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Élysées in the days leading up to the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first time, the Olympic opening ceremony will be held outdoors, with about 300,000 spectators expected to gather along the Seine River for the spectacular show on Friday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of their arrangements, French authorities have set up security perimetres, known as “grey zones”, near the river, and tourists will need to apply for a QR code in advance for entry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The police presence around the Olympic venues and events is very strong, and implementations of the red and grey zones to block of pedestrians and vehicle traffic as they see fit. I guess they are good, even though I can’t really walk the Seine right now because I don’t have a grey pass,” American tourist Mitchell Hasenpflug told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Takehiro Kinoshita, who travelled with his family from Japan to watch the skateboarding event, said he was surprised to see how clean and prepared the city is for the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel all the time safe 'cause you see all the police around the corner, and it’s amazing so I cannot complain,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But not everyone's amused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A local resident, Dominique, said traffic is getting worse with restricted zones and an influx of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s terrible, but we didn’t have the choice either… but no, of course you have inconvenience for these Olympic Games.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some businesses located in the sealed-off areas said they too are feeling the pinch, complaining about fewer customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also said they are closing for a few days until after the opening ceremony on July 26.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) on Tuesday said 45 air-conditioners had been delivered to the Olympic village in Paris for SAR athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SF&OC said the move was made after coordination by the SAR government and the liaison office, as well as communication with the organising committee of the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China delegation is one of several that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the government announced that culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung will fly to Paris on Thursday to attend events at the Games and cheer for Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During his stay, Yeung will meet with the SAR delegation in the Olympic village and watch competitions featuring Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung will return to Hong Kong on July 31.

    People hunt for bargains on last day of Book Fair

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The annual Hong Kong Book Fair closed on Tuesday, as sellers tried to clear stocks and readers try to hunt for bargains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ernest Kan, Deputy General Manager of Sup Retail (Hong Kong) Limited, said that sales this year were encouraging but more challenging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there are no consumption vouchers offered by the government this year, and so the pocket money of most citizens are tighter."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the other hand, Carminna of SmartKids said this year's sales were slightly higher than expected, and she thinks this was because people coming to the book fair were looking for special discounted items, which they did not offer last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gary Fung from iGlobe Publishing Ltd, which mainly sells travel books, said their new book focusing on Shenzhen has been popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because many people want to go to Shenzhen to play or eat every Saturday, every Sunday. So our book gives them many information on how to have more fun in Shenzhen, so many people come to book fair to buy this one (their book on Shenzhen)."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Trade Development Council, which organised the event, said total visitor numbers over the past seven days reached 990,000, similar to last year's figures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The book fair continued its tradition of bringing people together through literature, with seminars achieving remarkable popularity and attracting many visitors from mainland China to participate," said the council's acting executive director Sophia Chong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And on the final day of the book fair, buyers were taking advantage of cheaper prices, particularly with exam practice workbooks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them was Miss Song, who estimated that she would spend about HK$10,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "English books here are cheaper than in book stores outside. Because my daughter usually buys English books for about HK$140, but here maybe because the books are slightly older, or they were in stock for a long time, they cost only about HK$40."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, local student Evanna said this year's bargains were not as good as last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prices in the past years were not as expensive, and there also seems to be less variety this year."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="RTHK has learnt that physical education will take up two points in the internal assessment under a revised rubric. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762804_1_20240723154537.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Educators were on Tuesday divided over the idea of grading primary school pupils on sport alongside their academic performance, following reports that physical education (PE) will be included in assessments for secondary school allocation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Currently, schools internally evaluate their students with three rounds of exams in primary five and six under a 38-point system and submit the scores to the Education Bureau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three core subjects – Chinese, English and mathematics – take up nine points each, while general studies account for six. Visual arts take up three points and music two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But RTHK has learnt that authorities are looking to include PE, which will take up two points, while splitting the existing general studies subject into science and humanities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to sources, the core subjects will be lowered to eight points each, with the new humanities and science sections each taking up four points. Visual arts and music will make up two points each in the revised rubric that will add up to 38 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung said the proposed revamp should also take into account pupils with disabilities or chronic illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although it is a good concept, pupils' innate physical attributes vary greatly... Grading them on their performance in physical education may lead to pressure or comparison among them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I suggest schools evaluate pupils' sports performance in the first one or two years of the new assessment, but not submit their scores, because this would allow the education sector to have a more complete mechanism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Wai-lam, the principal of Fung Kai No 1 Primary School, told the same programme that the inclusion could be beneficial to pupils, who he said had been mostly static during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through sports activities, pupils' health will definitely be improved, while reducing the burden on society and healthcare in the future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The revised system could be in place from the 2026/27 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it is conducting a review and collecting opinions on the changes, and that it will make an announcement in due course.

    1,000 MTR staff deployed for Sunday's partial shutdown
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR says it will deploy 1,000 staff members on Sunday when a partial shutdown of the Kwun Tong Line takes place.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin will be suspended for the day due to a full maintenance operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maintenance will replace more than 50 large metal hangers used for hanging power cables on the tunnel ceiling of the crossover near Yau Ma Tei Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations will still be served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Train frequencies will be changed to accommodate citizens' needs, with Kwun Tong Line waiting times lengthened to five minutes to avoid overcrowding at Prince Edward Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsuen Wan Line trains will be available every 3.5 minutes, while Tuen Ma Line trains will arrive every 5.5 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail operator suggested passengers plan their journeys ahead and make use of alternative railway routes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Prince Edward Station will be very busy on that day because it will be the only interchange station between Kwun Tong Line and Tsuen Wan Line stations on this coming Sunday. We will provide extra hands, extra staff in the affected stations to help all passengers, [and] we will provide service counters at Prince Edward Station, Whampoa, Ho Man Tin and Yau Ma Tei during peak hours this weekdays and also on the coming Saturday and Sunday for whole day," said Cheris Lee, who heads the MTR's operating and metro segment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Crowd management measures will be in place at Prince Edward Station from Sunday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, free bus services will run between Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin, and Whampoa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bus route No.8 that runs from Kowloon Station to Tsim Sha Tsui Pier will be available for free to passengers for the whole journey, while passengers taking route No.30X that runs from Whampoa Gardens to Tsuen Wan Allway Gardens will not need to pay if they board at designated bus stops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both route frequencies will be increased to every 10 minutes, and staff will be present at different bus stops to assist citizens.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added there will be different checkpoints along the tunnel, and the company will continuously update the maintenance progress on Sunday so citizens will be informed about traffic conditions on Monday, July 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MTR said they are confident that the maintenance would be completed within 28 hours and citizens would be able to use train services as usual the next day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR expects the Tung Chung Line to be the next to undergo maintenance that will affect train services.

    'HK can play key financing role in Southeast Asia'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A member of an SAR delegation which will visit Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos along with Chief Executive John Lee later this month says Hong Kong can play a key role in financing projects in the Southeast Asian countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo Kam-wing, president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, said Hong Kong's professional services have global recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our accounting, financial, taxation, legal, our ESG [environmental, social, and governance] and construction can provide a high quality support for infrastructure development in these countries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can play a key role as an infrastructure financial hub and provide these countries with diversifying financing channels, including equity listing and also syndicate loans, private equity funds, ordinary bonds, etc."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jonathan Choi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said it is significant that Lee will lead the delegation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because as an individual company, we have been there for a long time, nothing special, we do it every day. But this time the CE is coming, then it is different. It shows that the whole Hong Kong or the business community is going to work together with these three countries."

    Let young entrepreneurs use abandoned schools: BPA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The BPA has submitted its policy address suggestions to Chief Executive John Lee. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=55&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762785_1_20240723134912.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) on Tuesday said the government should let young entrepreneurs operate from abandoned schools.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proposal is among the party's suggestions for Chief Executive John Lee's next policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, BPA chairman Lo Wai-kwok said many schools have shut down recently and the government should make good use of the campuses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Encouraging the entrepreneurship among our younger generation...one of the concerns is they need offices. They need some space for them to do their research," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since we have some facilities available in the community, so how to make better use of these facilities, of course, is an obvious thing that the government should consider and the government should do."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam, meanwhile, called on the government to drop duty on spirits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The loss of income on duties will be offset by the increase in economic activities many, many times. And we are confident that with this reduction of duty to zero, it would help to cheer up - we talk about spirit - the spirit of Hong Kong, the spirit of our citizens," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The BPA also suggested the CE loosen the requirements of the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme by allowing applicants to include the purchase of residential property.

    'Surge in illegal cigarette ads alarming'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="District leaders concerned total bans on cigarettes will exacerbate illegal advertisement problem. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762787_1_20240723135954.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 District councillors on Tuesday expressed concern over a surge in illegal cigarette advertisements, with bus stops, trash cans, and shopping mall restrooms becoming hotspots for these illicit promotions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proliferation of these advertisements has prompted calls for stricter enforcement to prevent further distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office must take decisive measures to comprehensively crack down on these activities,” said Sha Tin District Councillor Leung Ka-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government recently proposed 10 short-term tobacco control measures, but another Sha Tin District Councillor, Eddie Lam, cautioned against implementing tobacco restrictions all at once, citing that rash measures could stimulate the black market, pushing more smokers towards illicit cigarettes, and exacerbating the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that the government should implement policies in phases, it might be more effective instead of the 10 short-term policies at the same time,” said Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam suggested looking at other overseas practices for reference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Governments that have implemented flavoured cigarette controls have adopted phased implementation, such as the EU and Canada, which first banned fruit-flavoured cigarettes rather than implementing a blanket ban. The authorities should take this as a reference."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested five men on suspicion of selling fake concert tickets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Chan Hoi-leung said three people filed a report after paying between HK$1,500 and HK$3,300 for fake tickets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Police received reports that some people bought tickets online or outside concert venues, using cash or money transfer. When they attempted to enter concert venues, organisers told them that their tickets were... fake," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fake tickets were convincing and included security features such as QR codes and hologram stickers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police urged the public to avoid purchasing tickets from unofficial channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 34 and 46, were arrested on suspicion of obtaining property by deception and were being detained for further investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Hong Kong police officer has died while on holiday in the eastern Thai resort town of Pattaya after he was thrown off a small passenger truck on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department confirmed that it had received a request for help from the man's family, and pledged to render all possible assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to local media, the 48-year-old Chinese tourist, surnamed Lam, was found injured in the middle of the road after he was thrown off a songthaew, a popular form of public transport in Thailand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Photos circulating online showed locals giving first aid to the man, who was eventually pronounced dead in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The vehicle left the scene, and police have since located the driver who said he was not aware of the accident, according to media reports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police later confirmed that the man was a serving officer. The force expressed its deepest condolences and said it would keep in touch with the family to provide all appropriate assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fencing champion Edgar Cheung and double swimming silver medallist Siobhan Haughey have been named as the flag bearers for the Hong Kong, China team at the Olympic opening ceremony later this week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR Athletes will join thousands of other competitors in a unique ceremony taking place on the River Seine in Paris, and winding past some of the most famous landmarks in the French capital on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of their departure to Paris, the Chef de Mission of the SAR delegation, Brian Stevenson, called on Hongkongers to back the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look to the athletes to perform their best, and of course the best for each athlete differs, but I'm talking about their personal best. If they can achieve that, you cannot ask for more than that, other than that bit better than even their best," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'll be satisfied if all the athletes have given their very best performance and we know their records and what they can achieve."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who was the city's flag bearer at the Tokyo Olympics, becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to be picked for the honour in successive Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stevenson also confirmed air-conditioners will arrive at the Olympic village on Tuesday, admitting the units were arriving later than scheduled because of security reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is one of a number of delegations that decided to install air conditioners at the athletes' rooms, despite claims by the Paris organisers that a geothermal cooling system would keep temperatures at the newly-built village reasonable.

    DAB finds more than 90 flooding blackspots in city

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says the government should monitor flooding blackspots more carefully. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762661_1_20240722160025.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday said it had found at least 91 flooding blackspots during its survey of the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it conducted a thorough investigation of potential flooding blackspots from May to June this year, at the height of Hong Kong's rainy season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the flooding blackspots found, eight were on Hong Kong Island, 45 were in Kowloon and 38 were in the New Territories and on the outlying islands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Li, a DAB member, said they found the current drainage system insufficient, which causes problems such as clogged drains or flooding in malls and housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party urged the government to have more updated information on flooding blackspots, impose stricter flood drainage standards, and more closely monitor the responsibilities of managers at private premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also said there should be a better flood warning system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Let me raise an example. If anyone here has a mainland phone number, actually in mainland whenever an extreme weather event happened, the local meteorological bureau will immediately send messages to the phone number's owner, so that citizens can prepare ahead of time, like implementing flood prevention measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Global warming has resulted in an increased frequency of rainstorms, including more extreme ones, that are becoming more unpredictable and causing more severe cases of flooding.

 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) on Monday announced the establishment of the city’s first Department of Art and Machine Creativity, aiming to integrate tech and art to create a hub which cultivates talent in the creative industries and drives the development of art technology.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department is working on several research projects that experiment with the use of AI in the comprehension and creation of music, film, and visual art such as programming speaking voices to sing different songs in different languages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I do believe that machine creativity, just like machine learning now, will be the phenomenon of the future," said HKUST Professor Guo Yike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postgraduate courses on offer, beginning September 2025, will allow students to leverage technologies such as AI and machine learning in artistic creation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department has partnered with more than a dozen industry leaders and academic institutions, including Huawei, Sony Entertainment, and Bard College to strengthen curriculum development and collaborate on research in machine creativity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will work globally. You can foresee our students will have an education not just in Hong Kong, but treat Hong Kong as a hub for East-west culture exchange," said Guo.

    Liu Ma Kee admits buying mainland fermented bean curd

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The fourth-generation owner of Liu Ma Kee said the century-old fermented bean curb brand has been importing from the mainland for three decades.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Jay Liu said the company was unable to manufacture the raw product because it couldn't meet sewage regulations here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he emphasised that the items were processed locally, including seasoning and packaging, before they were put on sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Liu Ma Kee product was earlier found by the Centre for Food Safety to contain excessive levels of Bacillus cereus, sparking a war of words between the family running the business and health authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liu on Monday apologised to the Centre for Food Safety, saying his family members had overreacted in their comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company closed down last week, and Liu said it's unlikely to reopen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our decision to shut down the store has nothing to do with the incident. We had already been facing a lot of pressure to close down earlier due to the city's worsening economic situation, as well as the change in weather that poses a challenge to the preservation of fermented bean curd."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to inquiries from RTHK, Customs confirmed they are following up complaints against Liu Ma Kee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said officers will take appropriate action if they discover a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

    Three jailed in landmark market manipulation trial

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people have been jailed for up to six years and eight months after being convicted in a high-profile market manipulation case, with a High Court judge saying the trio had damaged the city's status as a financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sit Yi-ki, Lam Wing-ki and Tam Cheuk-hang were found guilty of conspiracy to carry out false trading in the shares of Hong Kong-listed construction services company Ching Lee Holdings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence on Monday, deputy High Court judge Douglas Yau said it was a "meticulously planned and executed conspiracy" which threatened the integrity of the market, and therefore sentences serving as a deterrent were needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission, which brought the case, said the conspirators artificially increased the turnover of the shares by conducting manipulative trading activities among 156 securities accounts in 2016, while netting illicit profits of more than HK$124 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ploy began before Ching Lee's listing on March 29, 2016 and lasted for more than five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The manipulative activities inflated Ching Lee's share price by as much as 2,000 percent and it reached a historic high of HK$5.98 on July 13. It closed at HK$4.87 on September 6, before a collapse of 90 percent the following day to HK$0.45.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission's executive director of enforcement, Christopher Wilson, said the sentences are the longest ever handed down by a court for a market manipulation offence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It sends a very strong and clear message that we will not tolerate any continuous and further misdoings. This is also the first time that one of our cases has been heard before the High Court before a jury," he told reporters after the hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are determined to root out all forms of market manipulation, to protect investors and uphold the integrity of Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other people alleged to have been involved in the case are currently wanted by the authorities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 In a world filled with misinformation and disinformation, seeing something may not be enough to make you believe it is true.
 <br>
  <br/>
  And with images that blur the line between reality and fantasy becoming more mainstream in everyday life, some people say they have become much more careful with how they consume what they see around them, especially on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To see just how sceptical people have become, our reporter Elvis Yu conducted an experiment. He asked members of the public to comment on a photo that had once sparked intense debate because it looked too spectacular to be true.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also spoke to experts and an investigative journalist to see what could be done to regain people's trust.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Standby Signal No. 1 was cancelled at 12.20pm on Monday as Tropical Storm Prapiroon no longer posed a threat to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But the Observatory said the rainbands associated with the storm are still affecting the coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At noon, Prapiroon was about 610 kilometres west-southwest of Hong Kong, and was forecast to move northwest at about 10 kilometres per hour crossing Beibu Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm earlier made landfall on Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The No. 1 signal, who was issued on Saturday evening, had been in effect for more than 37 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the weather on Monday will be mainly cloudy with a few squally showers and thunderstorms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will become very hot with sunny periods in the next couple of days, with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius or higher over the New Territories.

 Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth will be the first Hong Kong sailors racing in Olympic 49er competitions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 49er is a two-handed skiff-type high-performance sailing dinghy, which requires the two crew members to work on different roles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The duo told RTHK about their strong bond, which started in 2018 when they paired up.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Researchers at the Chinese University's Faculty of Medicine say they’ve found that patients who are of Chinese ethnicity are at higher risk of death if they develop a complication linked to blood thinning treatment for heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study analysed the clinical and imaging data of 232 patients who experienced an intracerebral haemorrhage between 2016 and 2021. It found that 70 percent of Chinese patients had a poor neurological outcome and almost 40 percent died within 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  European and American studies, meanwhile, found that only around 50 percent of patients suffered severe neurological disability and there was a 28 percent mortality rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is a very impactful finding,” said Dr Bonaventure Ip, an assistant professor of neurology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such a study has never been performed among the Asian or Chinese patients. That is exactly why we need to have a better management strategy for patients [with the disease]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Direct oral anticoagulants are widely used to reduce the risk of stroke, as the drug prevents clots from forming inside blood vessels. However, one in every thousand patients face the risk of developing intracerebral haemorrhage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The findings were released on Monday, to mark World Brain Day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team said people should maintain healthy habits, such as eating a balanced diet, exercise regularly and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption. They say such habits are especially important for people with atrial fibrillation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team also urged people to immediately seek help if they experience symptoms of stroke, including inability to move one side of their limbs, facial asymmetry, drooling of saliva and slurring of speech.

 The Correctional Services Department (CSD) on Sunday said a 60-year-old man, who was remanded in custody at Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution, had died at a public hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 60-year-old was accused of indecent conduct towards a child under the age of 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said he was suffering from liver cirrhosis, a condition caused by long-term liver damage resulting in scarring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was sent to hospital 10 days ago and was pronounced dead at 9 am on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CSD has informed the police and a death inquest will be conducted by the Coroner's Court.

    Guidelines not meant to find faults: sports bosses

<div class="itemFullText">
 New guidelines on the corporate governance of sports associations are expected to be unveiled in mid-September, Hong Kong's sports bosses said on Sunday, stressing they were not trying to pinpoint any shortcomings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China has been conducting a review of the corporate governance of national sports associations in the SAR following an audit report in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edgar Yang, the honorary secretary-general of the federation, said the sports governing body had submitted a plan to the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is not about fault-finding, picking out what is wrong. We always look at our national sports associations as our affiliates. They need our support, and what is right should stay, what is wrong should be changed. We need to keep up with the times. Times have changed and what's appropriate in the past may not be nowadays," Yang told a Commercial Radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[By doing so,] we hope the selection of athletes can meet our current requirements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, lawmaker Kenneth Fok said it's important for the sports governing body to conduct a "health check".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he urged people not to question the governance of the entire sports sector based on isolated incidents, saying that a majority of associations and organisations under the governing body had been able to promote sports development professionally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the upcoming Paris Olympics, Fok, who is also the federation's vice-president, said he believed there would not be blunders involving the national anthem at the Games as there were procedures in place to ensure the correct song was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe there will not be any mistakes at the Olympics, because it is the most sought-after event around the world. The organising committee would arrange for us to verify the national anthem and flags, and the whole process would require signatures," Fok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also have to tell our athletes that some audience members are very enthusiastic and they will bring regional and national flags to the venues. But sometimes, they may have the wrong versions. So we have urged athletes not to take the flags given to them, because it would become their responsibility once they take the flags."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR is sending 35 athletes to Paris, with more than half of them first-time Olympians.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fok called on the public to support them regardless of whether they win a medal or not, saying he was confident in the athletes' performance at the Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of a book fair in Wan Chai reminded exhibitors to comply with event regulations and all applicable laws in Hong Kong, including the national security law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Publisher Bbluesky, which is one of the exhibitors at the book fair, told RTHK on Saturday it was reminded by the Trade Development Council (HKTDC), which organised the book fair, to remove five titles from its booth, citing complaints and the perceived "sensitive" nature of their content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the books was one about media ethics by seasoned journalist Allan Au, and another written by former lawmaker and ex-prisoner Shiu Ka-chun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Boundary Bookstore also said it removed four titles from its booth, after receiving the same reminder from the HKTDC.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have the absolute and exclusive authority to determine our participation in the book fair, and what kinds of books we can have in the booth.They're exercising their rights, but it's a bit too stringent. It's also a bit hasty, because they only ask us to remove those books verbally - without providing any documentation," Leanne Liu of Boundary Bookstore told RTHK on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to questions from RTHK, a spokesperson for the HKTDC said the council would handle any complaints regarding suspected violations of event regulations in accordance with procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added the HKTDC would request exhibitors to stop displaying and selling the items in question when necessary.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong should strengthen its online sales sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said online retail sales have surged nearly 60 percent between 2020 and 2023, reaching HK$32.5 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the growth, Chan noted that online sales in Hong Kong only accounted for eight percent of total retail sales, lower than the 28 percent seen on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister said the government was providing support to local small and medium enterprises to expand their business opportunities, by enhancing their popularity on mainland online platforms and gaining a deeper understanding of the online sales market in the rest of the country.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the Trade Development Council would organise the first Hong Kong Shopping Festival next month, to help local enterprises enter the mainland market and revitalise Hong Kong brands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over 230 brands will have the opportunity to showcase their products, ranging from groceries to cosmetic items, on mainland online sales platforms during the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, Chan said three large-scale exhibitions - the book fair, sports and leisure expo, and a snack-themed exhibition - had attracted 760 exhibitors, serving as important promotion platforms for businesses in the city.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Monday morning said it expects the Standby Signal No 1 to stay in force until at least noon, though it's unlikely to issue a higher warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The number one signal was issued at 10.40pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of 4.45am on Monday, Tropical Storm Prapiroon was predicted to skirt more than 500 kilometres to the southwest of Hong Kong before moving away. It made landfall over Hainan Island at about 1.30am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Unless Prapiroon intensifies significantly, the chance of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals will be rather low," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with Prapiroon are affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary, the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Locally, winds were occasionally strong offshore and on high ground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public have been advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile another tropical cyclone, Gaemi, is expected to move towards the seas east of Taiwan and intensify significantly in the next couple of days. It's expected to bring very hot weather with a few showers to Hong Kong in the middle of the week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 at 10.40 pm, as the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remains rather loose.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tropical depression is expected to strengthen slightly and adopt a more northwesterly track during the day. The Standby Signal No 1 will remain in force at least until 5 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is now centred within about 700 kilometres of Hong Kong and may still affect us.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Squally showers associated with it and the southwest monsoon are covering the central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the present forecast, the tropical cyclone will intensify and gradually take a more northwesterly track, moving in the general direction to the vicinity of Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under its influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later tomorrow. There will be swells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline, not to engage in water sports and take note of the latest weather forecast.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said young people from Hong Kong can play a key role in the nation's technological development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong said people in Hong Kong now had a better understanding of the country, as patriotic education had been integrated into their daily lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hoped the territory's young people can use their knowledge of technology to offer more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a relatively strong foundation in technology, and has many high-quality tech talents who love the country and Hong Kong," he said at an awards ceremony honouring the work of teenagers in aerospace innovation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's an important driving factor in the country's development into an innovative nation... I hope Hong Kong teenagers can reach the peak of technology through their hard work and ambition."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same ceremony, Chief Executive John Lee said the country had high hopes that Hong Kong would develop into an international innovation and technology hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authorities will continue their efforts to nurture the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology is the primary productive force; talent is the primary opportunity; and innovation is the primary driving force," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government attaches great importance to the development of innovation and technology, making every effort to cultivate local talent and increase investment in the sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that a Hong Kong resident had been selected for the national manned space programme, and he hopes more young people can aim to join developments in the national aerospace industry.

    Development chief welcomes approval of San Tin plan

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn has welcomed a decision by town planners to approve zoning plans for San Tin Technopole, a project that will see the creation of an information and technology hub in an area that now contains fish ponds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Linn said the administration was now looking at ways to speed up the development process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Town Planning Board gave its approval on Friday, saying the decision was made after considering the views of various stakeholder groups, government responses, as well as hours of internal discussions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the majority of its members agreed the technopole is strategically important for development of the SAR’s technology sector, given its proximity to the Shenzhen IT zone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Saturday, Linn said the administration may speed up the work by selling plots at the same time as carrying out land formation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why is it beneficial if we can sell the land while land formation is under way? The developers who buy the land can immediately start working on building plans. This eliminates the need for everyone to wait for each other," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the administration will apply for funding from the Legislative Council's Finance Committee, saying that if land formation work can commence by the end of this year, the first batch of formed land could be ready in 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about what conservation work would be conducted, given that some 90 hectares of fish ponds will need to be reclaimed under the development plan, Linn said the impact is less significant than it seems, saying that more than half of the fish ponds affected are already abandoned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The development minister reiterated that the administration will stick to its promise and build a 338-hectare wetland conservation park alongside the technology hub as compensation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Science Park also welcomed the Town Planning Board's decision, saying the technology hub will provide additional space for research and collaboration between Hong Kong and the rest of Greater Bay Area.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Saturday said the government is closely monitoring ongoing problems caused by Friday's global technology outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The tech outage disrupted operations around the world on Friday, including halting flights and causing difficulties for the banking, health and media sectors in many countries. The problems have been blamed on a faulty software update issued by the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the SAR government's own computers were not affected, but officials were concerned and had been in touch with Microsoft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Chan said his deputy, Warner Cheuk, is monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The SAR government's computer system is not affected. The problem only affected particular airlines... But we're paying close attention to the incident, and we hope it returns to normal as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a problem affecting the whole world and it's an internal issue of the company. Hong Kong is not the only place affected."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said operations at the Hong Kong airport had fully returned to normal on Saturday, with airlines' travellers registration systems restored. That followed the implementation of contingency procedures on Friday, including manual check-ins in some cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But some flights scheduled for Saturday remained cancelled, including 20 from the Hong Kong Express.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some travellers arrived early at the airport on Saturday, with one getting there four hours ahead of her flight to Fukuoka.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were afraid there would be a lot of people at the airport... but it's not the airline's problem, so I won't blame them," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist said his flight, scheduled for Friday night, was delayed for more than 17 hours, and he was furious about the arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I only found out my flight was delayed after I waited at the airport for two hours. There's no compensation. They only allowed me to cancel the ticket. I'm very unsatisfied. I won't choose this airline anymore," he said.

    No rush to replace departed overseas judges: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Saturday said the Judiciary is in no rush to replace overseas judges who are departing the SAR's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two British jurists said last month that they were stepping down as non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal, while a Canadian member has said she will not extend her term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked on a radio programme how the judges would be replaced, Lam said there were "no vacancies" right now and they would seek new members at an appropriate time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't rely on non-permanent or overseas judges to handle our daily work. This is not our aim... but we hope to keep this system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If some venerable overseas judges take part in our cases, it will have positive effects on the development of our common law system, helping us become internationalised and maintain high standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US congressional committee and commission earlier wrote to the Washington government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR government officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there's nothing new with the calls for sanctions, describing the attacks as vague.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are criticising ongoing judicial proceedings. They intend to interfere in our judicial proceedings or put pressure on our judges... We are most alert about this, and I feel disgusted," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the duties of Hong Kong courts would not be affected by calls for sanctions on judges.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday that it would issue the Standby Signal No 1 at 10.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea remained rather loose, though squally showers were covering central to southern parts of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storm is expect to take a northwesterly track towards Hainan Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said that under the storm's influence, there will be occasional squally showers over the coast of Guangdong in the next couple of days. Winds offshore and on high ground in the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary will pick up gradually later on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Members of the public are advised to stay away from the shores and refrain from engaging in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile Macau's forecaster issued Tropical Cyclone Signal No 1 on Saturday morning, saying it was expected to remain in force for the whole day. The meteorological bureau said it would consider issuing Signal No 3 during the day on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Forecasters say another tropical cyclone over the western North Pacific will move towards the seas near Taiwan in the next few days.

    "Govt not obliged to help displaced flat owners"

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn on Saturday said the government isn’t obliged to provide extra help to flat owners who are forced to sell their homes under legal changes that will make it easier to redevelop old buildings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under changes approved by the Legislative Council on Thursday, the proportion of owners who have to agree to a redevelopment plan will fall to as little as 65 percent for properties at least 70 years old, instead of the previous 80 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said such deals were a matter for developers and flat owners, not the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The compulsory sales regime is to facilitate the redevelopment of our aged buildings in the private market," she told reporters after attending a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So it is activities between the private owners of individual flats and those developers who are interested in acquiring their flats. So there is no question of the government going into this market and having flats built to rehouse those owners affected.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that the government will assist minority owners in several ways, including establishing dedicated support centres that offer legal and valuation advice, as well as asking the Urban Renewal Authority to gather owners who would like their flats redeveloped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the development minister said that developers could be given the responsibility for land formation if they win tenders for sites in the huge Northern Metropolis development. She said the winning consortiums would also need to help build infrastructure and community facilities in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This approach will help reduce the cash flow burden on the government because we do not have to use public funding to do the site formation and other infrastructure on our own,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from the fact that the government recorded revenue of less than HK$200 million from land sales in the first quarter, against a target for the full year of HK$33 billion. She said the situation may change as the year progresses, so there was no need yet to rethink the target.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Express announced on Saturday that it was cancelling 20 flights as it continues to grapple with the effects of Friday's massive global technical outage, though four flights previously announced as cancelled have been reinstated.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The low-cost carrier said its booking and online check-in systems had "largely resumed" after
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "HK Express confirms that the service system of our service provider Navitaire, which was previously impacted by the global Microsoft system outage, is gradually resumed," the airline said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are doing our best to ensure that all systems resume normal operation as soon as possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four flights that were reinstated, flights 172, 173, 552 and 553, will be moved to different take-off slots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline is urging passengers whose flights have been cancelled not to go to the airport, but to make sure their contact information on the "Manage My Booking" app is up to date and to check their email regularly for the latest flight arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We appreciate our customers' patience and understanding," the airline said. "For other unaffected flights, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport as usual."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Airport Authority said on Saturday that its operations had returned to normal. Contingency measures, including manual check-ins for some flights, had been in place on Friday.

 The government on Friday said it is highly concerned about a large-scale IT outage involving Microsoft systems, saying officials will keep a close watch on developments and prepare to react accordingly.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the Deputy Chief Secretary will be responsible for monitoring the situation, adding that the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer has been in touch with Microsoft, urging it to assist affected companies, and come up with remedial measures as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said government systems are running normally for the time being, and that the Airport Authority has triggered an emergency response mechanism to minimise disruptions to passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Productivity Council’s Computer Emergency Response Team (HKCERT), meanwhile, called on people to back up their important data to prevent information loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It advised organisations to enable offline access for applications and documents as well to minimise interruptions to everyday operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The response team also reminded firms to come up with contingency plans in case similar incidents happen again.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) on Friday said contingency measures are in place after a number of airlines were affected by a global outage involving Microsoft systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the disruption affected five airlines, including Hong Kong Express, adding that these carriers had to switch to manual check-in, which was more time consuming and resulted in the delay of around a dozen flights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dicky, a tourist from Thailand, said he had arrived at the airport hours before his flight but couldn't check into his HK Express flight to Bangkok
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I am not in a hurry today, so I still can wait, but I am not sure for some people... If someone is in a hurry, then there definitely will be a delay. I mean, if I cannot check in now, it means maybe the flight will be delayed because they just say, please wait a moment, and then when the time has come, they will call us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller, surnamed Li, said his flight to the Thai capital was postponed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our travel plans will be slightly affected, for example the hotel arrangements, transportation and other issues. They might affect our itinerary. My kid may fall asleep very late tonight after arriving there. In such situations, we can only wait. There are no alternatives apart from waiting. I hope that the system will recover soon," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA said it has deployed additional staff to assist affected passengers, and that it is in close communication with airline operators to address the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Hospital Authority said its computer system has been functioning normally despite the global outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said it will ensure that the operations of public hospitals will continue as normal, and that it will closely monitor the situation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) has partnered with its third tech company, Galbot, to further develop the city's AI sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The company makes a humanoid robot, also named Galbot, which can complete basic household chores, such as hanging clothes, opening and closing drawers and pouring drinks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He Wang, director of the PKU-Galbot Lab of Embodied AI, explained what the partnership with HKIC means for the development of AI in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Leveraging Hong Kong’s strong market resources, abundant talent pool, and broad international insights, we look forward to curating attention and building credibility in domestic and international markets. Concurrently, we will bring Hong Kong the most cutting-edge embodied AI technology and cultivate top-tier talent with multi-disciplinary capabilities,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The partnership is also aimed at opening up more avenues for discussion surrounding AI for the younger generation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 secondary school students were invited to a launch ceremony on Friday, to engage in dialogue with forum guests and interact with Galbot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We look forward to doing more with Galbot in terms of cultivating our young talent,” said Clara Chan, CEO of HKIC.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A baleen whale found dead off Sai Kung last year was killed by back and spine injuries that were likely caused by propellers of a “fast-moving vessel”, authorities said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said they could not determine what type of vessel had hit the mammal, but ruled out the possibility it was a whale-watching or fishing boat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sightings of the juvenile Bryde’s whale had led to people going out in boats to try to get a glimpse of it, and officials urged against any chases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An expert from Spain consulted on the matter narrowed down the time of the whale's death to between the evening of July 30 and the early hours of the following day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A necropsy also found two fresher wounds on the whale, including one near its blowhole and the other near the dorsal fin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It can be concluded that the cause of death of this Bryde’s whale was a fatal boat strike,” the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The individual may have become separated from its mother or lost her, depriving it of maternal care and guidance. As a result, it was exposed to an unfavourable environment and local dangers.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Leung, who chairs an expert group on the conservation of marine mammals, said the boat involved was likely a dual propeller vessel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But officials said no whale-watching activity was detected during the four days prior to the mammal’s death, and that fishing vessels generally do not travel at such high speeds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We cannot tell what kind of vessel it was, and also we cannot tell the size of the vessel,” said AFCD director Mickey Lai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But the only thing we know…the vessel striking the whale should be travelling at a very high speed. We are talking about over 10 knots or even faster. But for the exact speed, we can’t tell.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten knots is roughly equivalent to 18.5 kilometres per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said officials will look into amending laws to designate temporary restriction areas more quickly, and banning whale-watching activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If the legislation can give us more power in imposing more control within the restriction area, and give us more flexibility, and also give us more power to designate this area in a shorter period of time, it can really help us to protect the whale within a really short period of time,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are talking about emergency situations, and everything has to be done within a very short period of time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration aims to put forward concrete proposals to the expert group in the third quarter of this year the earliest.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Authority (HA) on Friday announced new rules that punish public housing tenants for feeding feral pigeons or hanging objects from their windows.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HA, tenants will receive seven penalty points for "feeding feral pigeons or other wild animals".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tenants will also be slapped with seven penalty points for "hanging or placing objects with potential risk of falling from height outside the window, balcony or façade".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, residents are restricted from placing objects in corridors or staircases only.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, tenants will receive 15 penalty points if they resist or obstruct the HA or its authorised personnel in carrying out their duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Any household that accumulates 16 points within a two-year period faces eviction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new measures will take effect in the fourth quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The enhanced measures aim to provide a clean, hygienic and safe living environment for public rental housing (PRH) residents and strengthen the effectiveness of enforcement," an HA spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that the HA will step up promotion before the new regulations come into force.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Cruise & Yacht Industry Association announced on Friday that it has relocated to Singapore, saying it's following the lead of international cruise ships.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association said it made the move this month after taking into account operating costs and that a lot of international operators have switched their focus to the city state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's chief executive, Kara Yeung, said other cities did more than Hong Kong to support the sector's recovery after the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong was relatively lacking behind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only a few cruises came to the region this summer, and none of them call the SAR as their home port."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said Hong Kong has been promoting the recovery of the cruise industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said cruise ship arrivals this year have returned to pre-Covid levels, and it is working hard to increase the number of ship calls.

    Govt urged to offer shopkeepers rent cuts

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The New People's Party on Friday called for a reduction in rents for retailers operating from government premises, to help them cope with a citywide slump in sales.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The party said it recently sent questionnaires to more than 400 stores across the city, with shopkeepers reporting a drop in customer numbers and an increase in store vacancies, particularly in Northern District and Tai Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fifty-five percent of the shops said their rent had gone up after the pandemic, while almost 60 percent said they had seen a fall in sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recent official figures showed retail spending in May was down 11 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party noted that many people are heading to Shenzhen at the weekend to make cheaper purchases, urging the government to help alleviate the pressure on local retailers with rent cuts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also suggested the government should come up with area-specific promotions to help all 18 districts in the city attract visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't believe that [Hong Kong] has lost the market competition. We can have different promotion techniques for the government to promote together with the districts other than doing the same thing in all 18 districts," said the party's vice-chairwoman Eunice Yung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that rather than focusing on special days, tourism promotions should be expanded to ensure a constant stream of visitors.

    Public housing tenants to pay 10 percent more in rent

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762262_1_20240719121052.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Public housing tenants will soon see rents increase by 10 percent, after a committee under the Housing Authority backed the move.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The higher rents will take effect in October, but the authority has agreed to a three-month exemption period for most tenants, meaning they will not have to pay any extra before January 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairperson of the authority's subsidised housing committee, Cleresa Wong, on Friday said the waiver takes into account factors such as the impact on tenants and the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although there is a waiver, the Housing Authority will have a huge burden in the coming years. We have a massive housing development plan and the economy is also not very good, so we need to be prudent in our financial management," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regarding this exemption, the authority has tried its best and gritted our teeth to offer this waiver. We hope that members of the public and tenants will understand."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rent adjustment will see an average increase of HK$230. Wong said none of the committee members had an issue with the 10 percent increase, and that she believed it is an amount that residents can afford.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reviews public housing rents every two years, with increases capped at 10 percent. Between 2012 and 2018, there was a 10 percent increase following every rental review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said the mechanism, which takes into account tenants' income, has been effective, and that now is not a suitable time to review the system given the current economic situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed suggestions that rents should be reviewed annually or that the rate of inflation should be taken into account.

 Several people were injured when a taxi hit a road barrier and flipped over on Kwai Chung Road on Friday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The driver and his passenger were taken to hospital for treatment, as were two passengers on a passing KMB bus that was struck by debris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online photos showed two windows on the lower deck of the route 290 bus were damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately in Fanling, eight people were injured when a KMB bus, a van and a private car collided.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  KMB said it would cooperate with police investigations into both accidents.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said it strongly condemns and opposes US politicians' remarks criticising the SAR's homegrown national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It comes after a congressional committee and commission both wrote to the US government, demanding it impose sanctions on SAR officials, judges, prosecutors and police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said the letter made slandering remarks and despicable threats against relevant personnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said the so-called sanctions mentioned in the letter were a "despicable political manipulation to intimidate officials", and amounted to gross interference in the affairs of Hong Kong and the nation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement said safeguarding national security was an inherent right of all sovereign states.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the US had at least 21 pieces of legislation safeguarding national security and was in no position to point its finger at Hong Kong for doing the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also defended a recent national security trial against 47 people, saying the conviction of 45 of them over a conspiracy offence showed the scale and the seriousness of the criminal scheme.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they seized 31 kilos of suspected methamphetamine and five kilos of suspected cocaine in seven drug trafficking cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The haul had a market value of about HK$20 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said for six of the cases, drug traffickers were trying to hide the suspected narcotics in co-working spaces.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said drug traffickers would ship packages declared as chairs and children's toys from the United States and send them to different shared office spaces in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, aged 38, suspected of receiving the shipment was arrested in Wong Chuk Hang on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, officers arrested a 23-year-old passenger from Kuala Lumpur at the airport on Wednesday. He was found carrying suspected methamphetamine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two arrested men have both been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's representatives to the country's political bodies submitted their suggestions for the Policy Address to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday, focusing on patriotic education and economic development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the submission, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), Starry Lee, said it is the right time to put forward patriotic education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is the right time to do so. First of all, our country [has] our own policy and legislation to govern that. Hong Kong, as part of the country, [we are obligated] to do that. We understand...it will further make 'One Country, Two Systems' a more effective system for our own country," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dennis Lam, a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), urged the government to use Hong Kong's private healthcare services to attract mainlanders to the city, as more Hongkongers are seeking medical care on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bank of East Asia's Co-CEO Brian Li, who is a local delegate to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said the government should bolster the SAR's status as an offshore renminbi hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can strengthen our role as an offshore renminbi centre by gradually expanding the pool of offshore RMB funds and the scope of their applicability. We can also promote trading and fundraising in the stock market and the over-the-counter market, enhancing the international role of the RMB,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE is set to deliver his third Policy Address in October.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Thursday said it called the police over an incident that led to disruption to Light Rail services in Yuen Long, saying it suspected a truck had hit and damaged overhead cables.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they arrested the 47-year-old truck driver on suspicion of dangerous driving. He was held for investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said no injury was reported from the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rail company said the incident happened at around 2pm, and the affected section was near the Shui Pin Wai Stop, next to Yuen Long Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm said services gradually returned to normal after around three hours, following emergency repairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several Light Rail routes, including 610, 614, 615, 671P and 751, had to be diverted. Free shuttle buses  were laid on for passengers.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Local NGO, Agency for Volunteer Service, on Thursday said more than 54 percent of those it surveyed had taken part in organised volunteer service over the last three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its survey of more than 770 people, conducted last month, showed about 40 percent of participants volunteered through a charity or NGO. Melissa Pang, chairwoman of the agency, said reaching out to organisations to indicate a willingness to volunteer was an important first step for those looking to do volunteer work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is very important for them to get attached to an NGO or a school or other organisations who can provide more attractive scheme of volunteering. Sometimes they [the people looking to volunteer] might have the wish, 'oh I can spare an hour now to volunteer.' However, they might not find the appropriate work to do," Pang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also found that the economic value of volunteer service in 2023 was the equivalent to almost HK$11 billion, double the amount in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenneth Kwong, assistant professor at Heng Seng University, said that on a scale of five, with five being the happiest, people who volunteered were happier than those who didn't.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added a new research indicator had been created that would analyse participants' interest and input in volunteering, as well as the impact it creates. The data collected would help reflect a realistic picture of Hong Kong's organised volunteering efforts.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers of this year's Hong Kong Streetathon say participants will get a unique experience that engages all their senses.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The day will include a full marathon around Victoria Harbour, as well as a cross-harbour half marathon and a 10km race in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of what's being dubbed a "Five-senses Marathon", local delicacies will be dished out to runners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This, organisers say, will satisfy the gustatory sense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be music and fragrance diffusers in parts of the route for the auditory and olfactory senses, while the scenes of Victoria Harbour, various performances, and high fives from the sidelines will satisfy the visual and tactile senses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we aim to create the most meaningful marathon by bringing the first ever 'Five-senses Marathon' into the event to enhance the overall running experience," said Andes Leung, CEO and co-founder of organiser RunOurCity Foundation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said this year's marathon not only promises a fun running experience, but is also partnered with 25 charities and NGOs to advocate for the seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will include a family event, the Asian YOUTHRUN 10K race, designed to encourage students to participate in long-distance running activities to promote physical fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Streetathon will be held on December 8, with registration for the full and half marathon, and the 10K race beginning on July 25.

    Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Legco lowers compulsory land sales threshold" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1762099_1_20240718124251.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Developers hoping to knock down old residential blocks might not have to work as hard to get flat owners to agree in future, under changes to the law approved by Legco on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At present, developers need the backing of at least 80 percent of owners to trigger a compulsory land sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new law, thresholds as low as 65 percent will apply, depending on the age of a building and its location.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The lowest percentage will apply to buildings across the city that are at least 70 years old, as well as any block older than 60 years in the designated areas of Wan Chai, Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, Cheung Sha Wan, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City, To Kwa Wan and Tsuen Wan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The current 80 percent threshold will remain in place for buildings outside the designated areas that are between 50 and 60 years old, while developers will need to get the blessing of 70 percent of owners of blocks aged between 60 and 70 outside the designated areas, as well as those in buildings aged between 50 and 60 in the designated areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development minister Bernadette Linn brushed off calls by some lawmakers for the pace of redevelopments to be slowed down because of the sluggish economy and housing market, saying addressing the issue of ageing buildings is an urgent matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while sceptics may think the changes are to benefit developers, they are actually aimed at helping society at large.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The most important objective is to expedite redevelopment of old and debilitated buildings, to assist building owners in addressing the building hazards and improving the living environment for all," Linn said in the chamber.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Every now and then, we learn from the media criticisms about our approach, and that only private developers benefit from this policy [amendment], but this is not true."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said her bureau and the Urban Renewal Authority will both set up dedicated offices to offer more support for homeowners affected by redevelopment plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said that if all goes smoothly, the new thresholds could come into effect by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Most councillors spoke in support of the law changes. An amendment motion moved by Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen to keep the threshold at 80 percent in the designated areas was voted down.

    Watchdog apologises over Nongfu water row

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday apologised to mainland bottled water and beverages company Nongfu Spring after the firm threatened legal action over a report it condemned as erroneous and "massively damaging" to its reputation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an article in the watchdog's latest CHOICE magazine – which suggested people should stop buying bottled water altogether and make do with tap water – the council noted that every litre of Nongfu Spring's bottled water contains three microgrammes of the potential carcinogen bromate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council added that three microgrammes is the maximum amount permitted in mineral water under European Union regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report, which also covered a number of other bottled water brands, prompted an angry response from Nongfu Spring, which complained that its product should not be categorised as mineral water but "natural drinking water".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EU's limit for bromate in drinking water is 10 microgrammes per litre, more than three times higher than the level permitted in mineral water.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the council said it has reclassified the product in question as "natural drinking water" after holding a meeting with Nongfu Spring representatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog also adjusted its rating of the product, from 4.5 stars to the maximum five.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Consumer Council reiterated that all 30 water products it tested in the study were found to be safe to drink.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nongfu Spring also issued a statement noting that the council has found its product to be fully compliant with the relevant standards.

    West Kowloon arts hub plans to sell land in batches

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Betty Fung, on Thursday said land for residential developments at the arts hub site will be sold in two or three batches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fung said the authorities will work with private developers on land sales for homes, but not for hotels and offices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because as a blueprint for diversified property development, we think it is best to keep some properties to ourselves for rental income."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the vice-president of the Our Hong Kong Foundation think tank, Ryan Ip, said private residential developments at the cultural district should incorporate art elements and have areas that are open to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Development Bureau has to act as a gatekeeper to make sure the whole project will not become a pure luxury residential project just like you can find anywhere in the city," Ip said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A project that can be seamlessly integrated within the West Kowloon Cultural District by, for example, adding in arts and culture elements in its design and also allowing the public to use some of the public open space within the residential projects."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip said the land parcels are in a prime location and could bring in HK$15 billion for the authority, which is currently losing around HK$700 million a year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A man from Hong Kong has been arrested in Singapore on suspicion of drug trafficking, SAR police said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said it had contacted counterparts in Singapore over suspicions that gangs in Hong Kong were sending people there to smuggle drugs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Singaporean officers arrested a 25-year-old man as he was allegedly handing over a box to a logistics company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SAR police said four kilogrammes of methamphetamine worth around HK$3 million was found inside two statues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was detained pending further investigation, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau said anyone found guilty of trafficking more than 250 grammes of methamphetamine can face the death penalty.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Lands Department on Wednesday announced the first successful tender of residential land in seven months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sun Hung Kai Properties beat 10 other bidders and won the tender for a site in Siu Lek Yuen, Sha Tin, for HK$619 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The figure was in line with market expectations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The site is expected to generate around 280 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was the only residential plot on offer in the April-June quarter under the government land sale programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties, Victor Lui, said the company will build small and medium-sized units there, with a total investment of around HK$2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kathy Lee, head of research at Colliers, said the government's first successful sale of residential land after scrapping property-cooling measures in February sent a positive message to the market, amid concerns that developers were reluctant to bid for land.
