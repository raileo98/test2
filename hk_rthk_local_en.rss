<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on Tuesday said it achieved record-breaking earnings in the first quarter of 2024, boosted by the opening of its "World of Frozen" attraction last November.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The first quarter of 2024 was our most successful quarter ever, achieving record-level revenues, [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization] and net income. These results are our continued focus on creating the best place to work for our amazing cast members in the power of Disney brand and franchises," said the resort's managing director Michael Moriarty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland also noted its net loss had shrunk by 83 percent to HK$356 million in the fiscal year of October 2022 to September 2023 while year-on-year revenue grew by 156 percent to HK$5.7 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park attributed the boost to a strong rebound in both local and non-local travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total attendance last year grew by 87 percent to 6.4 million with the number of local visitors reaching a record-high, the company said, and a rebound in mainland China visitors was particularly strong, but there was also growth in visitor numbers from Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disneyland had operated at a loss for nine fiscal years in a row, but Moriarty highlighted that the park actually turned profitable if the number was calculated from January to December 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we look at the fiscal year, I think you have to really look at it in two ways - there’s a lot of old news in there, and our losses that we suffered as a result of COVID are very similar to those during the previous years during COVID that everyone suffered through,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But as soon as the masks came off, our business took off. And literally, immediately out of the gate, we started to out-pace the market's recovery. And that's when we really started to turn profitable right away, in the summer of last fiscal year.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that demand for the resort’s three hotels was also recovering strongly, with a more than 90 percent booking rate observed in the first three months of 2024.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Bernadette Linn said the government has always played the gatekeeping role when it comes to harbourfront protection." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758974_1_20240625162749.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development Secretary Bernadette Linn on Tuesday criticised a concern group for claiming that proposed changes to harbour protection laws would strip the courts of the power to adjudicate on controversies involving reclamation projects in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Society for Protection of the Harbour had argued that legal changes aimed at making it easier for smaller reclamation projects to be carried out will shift gatekeeping powers from the courts to officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Linn told lawmakers at a development panel meeting that such gatekeeping has always been carried out by the government and if the legal amendments are approved, people will still be able to challenge decisions by way of a judicial review.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary said the default position will continue to be that large-scale reclamation in the harbour is banned unless there is an overriding public need for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before the Executive Council makes a decision on such a project, the public would have a chance to have their say on the matter, Linn added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial secretary would make decisions on whether to allow smaller projects, or those that are only temporary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn stressed that the government has no plans to carry out large-scale reclamation in Victoria Harbour for housing, commercial or industrial developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of the amendment is to improve harbourfront connectivity, enhance harbourfront areas for public enjoyment, or strengthen functions the harbour ought to have," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All the councillors at the meeting expressed their support for the proposed changes, with several saying they hope more facilities will be approved around the harbour to improve people's livelihoods.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Tuesday charged a man with writing words with seditious intention on the back of bus seats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said the writing, found on public buses in March and April, provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention", contravening Section 24 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was also charged with destroying or damaging property.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A DAB lawmaker on Tuesday called on the government to beautify Sham Shui Po, to attract more visitors to the district.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Vincent Cheng, who represents the Kowloon West geographical constituency, said businesses in Sham Shui Po are struggling to survive as more Hongkongers head north for tourism and shopping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the government should begin with enhancing the appeal of Apliu Street.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apliu Street is one of the really historical streets. It's full of different kinds of electricity products, especially the old cameras, the old CDs, a lot of different musical stuff over there. So we do think there are a lot of visitors going around there every day. So we do think there's a good attraction," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, the government can have some promotion or revamp to make sure that everyone knows that Apliu Street is really good for the tourists."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also suggested installing figures of the district's mascot, known as "Sham Duck", and renovating the "pai dong" hawker stalls in the area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the upcoming July 1 holiday is a special day that people should celebrate freely, while warning of potential "undesirable activities".
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told reporters that he believed people would cherish the current safe and stable situation in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that people will celebrate July 1 happily. At the same time, we have to stay vigilant against undesirable activities taking place, say for example, activities that hijack this important date," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have stability, our security is safeguarded. I'm sure people will look forward to the celebrations. Police will take into account the situation and make arrangements as necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the absence of demonstrations on July 1, the chief executive said there are many ways and channels for people to express their opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Lee is set to lead a delegation of principal officials to Guangzhou on Thursday for an annual conference, with discussions on past achievements and future cooperation in areas such as innovation and technology, finance, and healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said cooperation between Hong Kong and Guangdong would help contribute to the high-quality development of the Greater Bay Area, adding there were unlimited opportunities for both sides.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong airport officials must make improvements and ensure a glitch that affected many passengers over the weekend does not happen again, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, a computer malfunction paralysed real-time flight information updates on the airport's display screens, as well as on digital platforms, for hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said although no flights had to be cancelled, the glitch affected a lot of passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that transport authorities immediately met Airport Authority management regarding the incident, and that airport bosses had been told to submit a detailed report to prevent similar incidents from happening in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have asked the Airport Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of the system, including its backup system, to upgrade its capacity in activating the system and to review its risk management measures amid the completion of the third runway system," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong International Airport is an international aviation hub. It is of paramount importance to provide high-quality and stable services to passengers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Preliminary findings showed there were issues with activating the authority's backup system following the glitch.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that power company CLP must get to the bottom of a series of power outages in recent months, adding that he's highly concerned about the matter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee said before the weekly Executive Council meeting that CLP needs to improve in a number of areas to ensure a stable and reliable power supply, which he stressed is important to the people and the territory's economic development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is necessary for CLP to identify the root causes of the problems, make fundamental improvements to reduce the chance of similar incidents in the future," the CE told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some systems may have been running for a long time, so it is important that they're always well-maintained, then there'll be a good system to ensure that periodic checks take place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said it is essential for the company to deploy more manpower to improve its response to emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed that officials will follow up on CLP's plans to enhance its overall power supply system capabilities and reduce the risks brought by adverse weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm had said that a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday may have been caused by the weather.

    HK to host world youth summit in August: Mak

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Alice Mak says August's youth summit will provide a platform for meaningful exchanges between people from all over the world. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758913_1_20240625105757.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Alice Mak, said a summit would be held in August to provide an opportunity for young people from different places to come together and exchange ideas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, Mak said more than 1,000 youth leaders and speakers from different parts of the world, including the mainland, would be invited to the Youth Development Summit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said young people attending the event could understand global development trends and plan their future effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main objective is to create a platform where people from different places can meet our outstanding young people. They can learn about the remarkable qualities and potential of our youth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In addition, our young friends in Hong Kong will have the opportunity to interact with people from other cities and meet various youth leaders. This will enable them to broaden their horizons and foster more meaningful exchanges".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, she said the government was working well with district councils and care teams to provide comprehensive support to people living in different areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mak said district councillors and care teams regularly visit residents to understand their needs and find solutions to problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing the example of a deadly fire in Jordan in April, Mak said that without the cooperation between care teams and district councils, the government would not have been able to provide services to affected residents as efficiently and effectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have more partners in the districts. We are no longer relying on the government's resources and capacity alone."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has hit back at what it calls "unsubstantiated remarks" from the US State Department in its latest Trafficking in Persons Report, which said Hong Kong was actively being used by syndicates as a destination or transit point for human trafficking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the SAR government said it vehemently opposed and firmly rejected what it called unfounded and false remarks in the report about the situation in Hong Kong. The SAR statement said trafficking in persons was never a prevalent problem in the city, and there had never been any sign that Hong Kong was actively used by syndicates to conduct such activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the rating of Hong Kong as Tier 2 on its Watch List was "unfair, misconceived, and not substantiated by facts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government said it had been making proactive and multi-pronged efforts in the fight against trafficking in persons, and had injected an enormous amount of resources into combating the issue, as well as enhancing protection for foreign domestic helpers in Hong Kong. It said the government spared no effort in conducting initial screenings for all persons vulnerable to trafficking risks, including illegal immigrants, sex workers, illegal workers, helpers, imported labour and other suspected victims.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in 2023, it screened 11,000 people, representing an increase of 45 percent compared to the previous year. It found only three victims, which demonstrated that trafficking in persons wasn't prevalent or widespread in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said it would be baseless and unfair to cast doubt on the city's quality of screenings just because of the low number of the victims identified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also noted that in 2018, it established a high-level steering committee that provided policy on human trafficking and protection of foreign domestic helpers.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Court of Final Appeal hears the case of the seven defendants on Monday. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758819_1_20240624184755.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Final Appeal on Monday reserved judgement in a case of seven defendants and their involvement in an unauthorised procession in 2019, with the arguments from the prosecution and defence centring on the issue of proportionality.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six former lawmakers – Martin Lee, Albert Ho, Margaret Ng, Lee Cheuk-yan, Cyd Ho and Leung Kwok-hung – and Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai had been found guilty of organising and taking part in the demonstration on August 18, 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police had approved an assembly at Victoria Park on that day, but banned a march out of the venue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier acquitted them of organising the assembly, but upheld the participation convictions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also lowered by several months the defendants’ jail sentences, which ranged from suspended terms to up to 18 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the final appeal by the seven defendants, the defence lawyers argued at the city's top court that because police didn’t make any arrests on the day and the demonstration was peaceful, their subsequent arrests and convictions were “operationally disproportionate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the court should conduct proportionality tests when passing a verdict, arguing a conviction would be a form of restriction that infringes on the fundamental constitutional rights of the freedoms of assembly and expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The courts, they argued, must protect such rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice (DOJ) countered that there was nothing in the law to support a proportionality test at the conviction stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior Counsel Benjamin Yu, for the DOJ, also argued the defence had not raised the issue before, and had no ground to do so now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s not simply they were engaged in an unauthorised procession, it was also that they knowingly violated the prohibition by police,” Yu told the court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges, led by Chief Justice Andrew Cheung, reserved judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four of the defendants attended the hearing. Lai and Leung, who are in custody over separate national security cases, did not attend. Cyd Ho, who had finished serving her sentence over this case, was also absent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said the restructuring of the government's arts and culture promotion agency marks a milestone in the industry's development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung attended the launching ceremony of the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA), which is the successor to Create Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CCIDA aims to be a one-stop shop for the sector, in areas such as intellectual property and content distribution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the ceremony, Yeung said the formation of the new agency is part of the government's efforts to turn Hong Kong into a global hub for arts and cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is taking on a new mission to create a better environment in Hong Kong, with an industry-oriented approach as a guiding principle to further promote the development of culture, art, and creative industries," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries Victor Tsang said CCIDA will focus more on the industrialisation of the arts and cultural sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Create Hong Kong focused more on the nurturing of talent and also explored more markets. But... we actually have to discuss more with each of the industries whether we can do a series of support in terms of different projects in order to bring them up to another level, maybe even at the top of the world. And this is what our strategy will do," he said.

    'CLP should prioritise protecting electricity pylons'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CLP Power says it will continue to install protective devices at its transmission towers that are more likely to be affected by inclement weather. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758799_1_20240624152506.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There were calls on Monday for CLP Power to weather-proof its transmission towers to ensure they withstand the impact of inclement weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The electricity supplier said it had begun installing such facilities and would continue to do so in the coming two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm, which supplies electricity to Kowloon and the New Territories and most of the outlying islands in Hong Kong, set out short-, medium-, and long-term measures to deal with power interruptions, after reports of a power outage in buildings from a voltage dip on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Short-term measures include increasing manpower and resources to minimise the recurrence of power disruptions and restore electricity as quickly as possible, while measures would be taken over the medium term to boost protection of outdoor facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the long run, the electricity supplier would review its asset management and maintenance with the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Wing-yip, an electrical and building services engineer, said the firm should prioritise protective devices for its transmission towers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the rainy season has just started with typhoons expected, the priority should be on implementing waterproofing and anti-lightning facilities. There must be some kind of priority, because there's quite a number of transmission towers, with over 100 of them in the New Territories," Ho told an RTHK programme on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we need to put in place such measures, we have to be selective. Some of the transmission towers are on mountain tops, and they are more prone to be struck by lightning, so they should be dealt with first given the limited resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, CLP's senior director, power systems, told the same programme there would be more anti-lightning devices in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We had begun installing anti-lightning devices as early as 20 years ago, for the sake of risk management. We referenced data from the Observatory, and installed anti-lightning devices at areas that were more likely to be struck by lightning," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the change in climate, there is a rising thunder frequency, so we will set up these protection devices in high, middle, and even low risk areas. We hope to do that in areas that we considered to have such a risk in the coming two to three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Cheung did not say whether the firm would compensate affected residents, only noting the electricity supplier was focusing on preventing more future power outages.

    Applications open for new light public housing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications opened on Monday for the first batch of light public housing flats, with hundreds of hopefuls turning up at the Housing Authority's office in Lok Fu.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said it had received some 1,800 applications by 6pm on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 units in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok will be ready early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The modular homes are a stop-gap measure designed to improve the living conditions of those waiting for public housing, with priority given to families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants, who must have been on the waiting list for public housing for at least three years, will still be eligible for traditional flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Accompanying her mother, Bibi said getting one of the new flats would help them save money on rent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the money we pay for rent in private, we can save HK$7,800. I hope my mom can get [a flat] as we don't know who can get them as there are many people applying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man surnamed Law said he lives in a subdivided flat in Tseung Kwan O and has been queuing for a public unit for four years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government rolled out the [light public housing] plan and I am eligible, so I came here to apply. It is undoubtedly better than living in subdivided flats, it has everything," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Victor Lee, 64, said he would like to move to one of the modular flats while he waits to get a traditional unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now I live in To Kwa Wan, one of the subdivided apartments in Hong Kong. The living condition is poor and there is [only] enough room for myself and my dog," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants will be notified by the last quarter of this year.

    Civil servants must safeguard national security: Yeung

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has said it is most important for government workers to uphold the constitutional order and national security, according to the code of conduct for civil servants.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authorities earlier revised the Civil Service Code, which lays out 12 fundamental values and standards of conduct, including political neutrality, confidentiality, and integrity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current government term, Yeung pointed out that civil servants are obligated to protect national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 12 values are all important. If I need to choose the most important value in the Civil Service Code, I'd agree it's the first one: upholding the constitutional order and national security," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The work of civil servants is not just a job or a means to achieve personal accomplishments or earn a salary. It is a mission. Civil servants have their constitutional roles to fulfill."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the government is streamlining the civil service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From March 2021 until now, our civil service establishment have decreased by some 1,000 or nearly 2,000 [positions]. We have achieved this through various means, such as using more technology and streamlining procedures. We constantly review our processes which are no longer necessary. By eliminating those procedures, we can allocate manpower to other tasks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, on dental benefits for government workers, Yeung said the government is thinking about purchasing dental services in the Greater Bay Area, so that civil servants can access these benefits across the border.

    <![CDATA[<img alt='China strategist and former director of social welfare Andrew Leung said care teams translated "empty ideas" into concrete actions. Photo: RTHK' referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758753_1_20240624104550.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 China strategist Andrew Leung says Hong Kong has made advances in the field of social welfare over the past two years, although government departments still need to take more initiative when it comes to talking to one another.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comments on RTHK's
  <i>
   Hong Kong Today
  </i>
  programme as he was discussing next week's 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the two years in office of Chief Executive John Lee and his governing team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a number of achievements, for example on the social welfare front. You know, I have been Director of Social Welfare for four years before [former Chief Executive] Carrie Lam. So I'm quite familiar with this kind of improvement of various services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The establishment of the care teams, for example, actually translates kind of empty ideas into concrete actions. So I think that's very good."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Care teams were announced in the 2022 Policy Address. Coming under the Home Affairs Department, they support the government's district work, including visiting the needy and providing support during incidents and emergencies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also said many government departments still tended to operate within their own structures, undermining efficiency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Regularly, people are not satisfied with the kind of people-oriented delivery of various government systems because various departments still tend to work in silos and they just sort of follow their own rule book," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said there needed to be better coordination among government departments.

 The Airport Authority on Monday said all of the displays are working normally at Hong Kong International Airport, after a computer glitch on Sunday caused displays, the airport's website, and the MyHKG app to stop updating real-time flight information.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said all the flight information display screens - including those in the departure halls, arrival halls, boarding gates and baggage reclaim halls - were operating normally. It said there had been a thorough check-up in the early hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority also said its website and the MyHKG app were operating normally and were providing real-time flight information. It said flights continue to operate normally but it was advising passengers to refer to the latest flight information and to allow sufficient time to check in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Sunday, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, Ricky Leung, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack.

    More firms to join scheme to fight cybercrimes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police announce this year's "Bughunting" campaign to help deter cybercrimes. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758669_1_20240623143857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A scheme aimed at helping businesses fight cybercrimes is set to be expanded this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police will partner with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data to relaunch the "Bughunting" campaign that was first introduced in 2023 to help firms identify underlying cybersecurity problems. It also provides free tests to participating enterprises to identify cybersecurity loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixty companies joined the campaign last year and 197 security loopholes were identified, with 10 percent of them of severe level and around 40 percent of high risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, the number of participating firms is expected to top 200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe most corporates will not have much resources to take on cybersecurity work as they have other business to take care of, therefore we hope to use resources to help corporates to deal with their cybersecurity problems," said Baron Chan, superintendent of the police Cyber Security Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the tasks for the authorities is to collect intelligence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have been collecting intelligence from other sources to understand the overall cyber-threat landscape. In the first quarter of this year, we analysed over 2.8 million pieces of cybersecurity threat, of which 18,758 were related to attacks against Hong Kong," said Raymond Lam, chief superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, adding that 46 percent were related to phishing and 30 percent linked to malware.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the first four months of this year, the number of tech-related cases stood at 10,113 – a figure similar to last year's – involving HK$1.86 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said while most of the culprits were from overseas, officers will also keep an eye out for local hacker groups.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's sole delegate to the country's top legislature, Starry Lee, headed to Beijing on Sunday for the upcoming National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport prior to her departure, Lee said the NPC Standing Committee would be reviewing 12 pieces of legislation at the meeting, among them draft revision to the Emergency Response Law, draft Financial Stability Law and draft Preschool Education Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that five reports would be deliberated as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said it is important for Hongkongers to be aware of changes in national laws even though laws on the mainland do not apply directly to Hong Kong, given that many people from the SAR often travel and do business there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The NPC Standing Committee meeting will be held from Tuesday to Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said real-time updates on its terminal display screens were gradually resuming on Sunday afternoon, hours after a glitch in its flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were cancelled but a few were delayed due to the system failure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Leung, the authority's executive director of engineering and technology, said there was no evidence it was a hacking attack, and that they will later examine the system in detail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will actually do more thorough checking in the rest of the time... There is no hacking activity we've identified so far. In terms of maintenance, it's mainly maintained and operated by our own in-house personnel," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AA has said all airport operations were normal as it was trying to fix the glitch.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the incident, and told the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

    'Expand medical fee waiver to lessen patients' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tim Pang of the Society for Community Organisation (third right, front row) says any public medical fee increases should not exceed 10 percent. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758678_1_20240623155609.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO said on Sunday that a medical fee waiver mechanism that provides assistance to needy patients should be widened to include people aged 65 or above, patients receiving disability allowance and those on working family subsidies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tim Pang, community organiser from the Society for Community Organisation, made the comment after the government said it would review fees and charges for public healthcare services within this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For elderly who are receiving the Old Age Living Allowance, the existing waiving level is up to 75 years old, so we will propose lowering the eligible age to 65. Another category for waiving should be patients receiving disability allowance. For those who are already recipients of disability allowance, it means they have more needs, more frequent need to consult medical service, so it cost them more on the medical fee," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For helping the low-income families, we think if they are receiving working families subsidies, it is already showing they have financial difficulties and for these families, the government should issue them a waiver. Any of the family members who have medical needs, they can waive their medical fees when consulting public doctors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Based on a questionnaire conducted on people's thoughts of higher medical fees, Pang said the survey revealed that some people experienced financial burden when medical bills began to pile.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We find out that particularly some patients who do have higher medical expenditure to their household income, so we think the government should study this group of people, so-called poverty due to disease. We think it should be another targeted group that the government should study and also provide additional support to prevent poverty due to disease," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waiving of medical charges currently includes recipients of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, some holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly, and Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pang added that any fee increases should be no more than 10 percent, to minimise the financial burden on patients.

    Govt considering law amendment to handle ride-hailing

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758675_1_20240623153656.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Sunday said the government is looking into amending the law to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a television programme, Lam said he expects the quality of cab service to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system, under which an online booking channel is a requirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked whether online car-hailing platforms will be regulated, the secretary for transport and logistics said the authorities were still working on the matter, and they'll further discuss it with Legco and the sector next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see whether we can amend the law to make it easier and more effective to handle unlicensed ride-hailing services. At the same time, we will see how to manage online car-hailing platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We shall look into how this is done overseas. There are a lot of online car-hailing platforms on the mainland or in other Asian countries. We are looking into their laws and requirements for licences."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a survey found that about 75 percent of interviewees support legalising online car-hailing services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Youth Forum interviewed more than 800 people earlier this month, and it found that over half of the interviewees said they would use online ride-hailing services instead of taxis, if the price is similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said introducing online ride-hailing could lead to fair competition, thus improving the service quality of taxis.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an enterprise from the United States has chosen Hong Kong to set up its first bio-computing innohub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan also said the first Bio-Computing Innovation Summit will be held in Hong Kong on Monday, and discussions will be held among global leaders in areas such as artificial intelligence and life sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Hong Kong Investment Corporation will sign a strategic collaboration agreement at the summit with the US biotechnology research company, BioMap, which is setting up business in Hong Kong this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the company will be able to support bio-computing-related research in areas like medical and health, green technology and industrial innovation.

    Power outage in buildings after voltage dip: CLP

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 CLP said it received reports of power outage in buildings after a voltage dip in the early hours of Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government expressed concern about the incident and told the power firm to submit a report within four weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said at about 3am, a brief voltage dip occurred at its overhead line power supply system connecting Yuen Long and Shenzhen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said while no power interruption was caused by the voltage dip, power supply might have been affected by unstable weather as the thunderstorm warning was in force at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Fung Chuen Court in Diamond Hill, the security office said a blackout there lasted for more than an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's not immediately known how many buildings were affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said the utility company should enhance the capability of its power supply system, particularly the lightning protection capability of 400 kV overhead line towers, as soon as possible to withstand the impact of inclement weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse also said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will follow up with CLP on how to reduce the risk caused by the high frequency of thunderstorm warnings in these few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has told the firm to identify the cause of the incident and formulate improvement plans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's the latest in a series of glitches involving the power firm. Earlier this month, the government said it would ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for about four hours.

    Computer system failure affects flight data updates

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority (AA) said on Sunday that it could not provide real-time updates on flight information on the terminal's display screens at the airport, its website and the My HKG mobile app because of failure in the flight information display system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The AA said no flights were delayed due to the incident. But it still advised passengers to allow for sufficient time to check in at the airport and to communicate with airlines on the latest flight status.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, it doesn't affect the data. That's why all the airport operations, including the check-in, the landing and departure, were normal," Steven Yiu, the authority's executive director of airport operations, told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What has been impacted was the fixed display to the public, including the website and also the mobile app. We found [problems with] some of the software controlling the display system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yiu said the AA was trying to fix the glitch as soon as possible, adding that there was no evidence showing that it was caused by human error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said its emergency centre has been activated, and contingency measures have been implemented to handle affected service and procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only a problem with the display screens so it probably won't affect the flights. But because this is very important information for travellers, I hope they can fix it as soon as possible," a tourist told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another traveller complained about the inconvenience caused.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It creates a lot of trouble. I don't know where I should go to check-in. I have luggage and kids with me. It's just troublesome. No matter at which airport, if such a problem occurs, and no one is assisting travellers, it must affect the reputation of the place," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said he's very concerned about the computer glitch, and that the AA should make every effort to keep passengers informed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on social media, he called on the authority to investigate the case and submit a report to the government.

 Police on Saturday arrested a man on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend at a Fanling flat on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 59-year-old suspect called the police at 5.23 pm on Saturday to report that a woman was unresponsive at a flat in Wah Min House on Wah Sum Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Paramedics arrived ten minutes later and declared the woman dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Po assistant commander Brian Chung said the woman had sustained multiple bruises and arrested the man on the spot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death, he added, and investigations are continuing.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Commissioner of Police, Raymond Siu, on Saturday said the force will “resolutely enforce the law” if anyone attempts to incite or commit illegal acts that undermine social peace and the security of Hong Kong and the nation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a graduation ceremony at the Hong Kong Police College, Siu also noted that the force is stepping up online and offline intelligence gathering ahead of SAR Establishment Day on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If we are aware of any attempt to disrupt social peace, we shall certainly act quickly,” he told reporters after attending the ceremony.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We shall make appropriate deployments to maintain national security and also Hong Kong's public safety and order. We shall make sure there are sufficient numbers of officers on duty on July 1 to ensure that all celebrations are conducted in a safer and orderly manner,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that "while society seems peaceful on the surface, there are still many ‘undercurrents’".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “External forces or some anti-China rioters, who have fled Hong Kong, have attempted to smear the National Security Law via various means, or incite others to hate the central government and the SAR government, I call on the public to be careful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Siu said there had been a significant rise in burglary cases in the city, with the number rising by 30 percent year-on-year to 604 in the first five months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said village houses were especially vulnerable with break-ins rising by 170 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He attributed the cases to increased travel and called on the public to lock doors and windows when going out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Of course, we have also stepped up patrols - especially in areas where there are village houses,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of the city's overall criminal cases, meanwhile, stood at 36,940 in the first five months of the year, increasing by three percent from the same period a year ago, according to Siu.

    Tourism Board lauds social media portrayal of HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Board on Saturday hailed the usage of social media in promoting the SAR, as he hinted at new incentives in the pipeline ahead of summer holiday season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Dane Cheng said that since visitors were now focusing more on having “in-depth experiences” during their trips, and not specifically travelling for “shopping”, the board has been collaborating with social media platforms to provide travel-related content to woo visitors, including inviting influencers visit the SAR to share their travel tips.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think we've been very effective and particularly in the mainland and overseas. A lot of the time, I think it's important that these social media are reposted or retweeted organically,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The important thing is that he content has to be genuine and authentic.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng also hinted that the board was preparing a raft of new incentives for summer, and more details would be revealed next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said in the face of strong competition from Japan and the rest of Asia, there would be more event promotion to attract long-haul visitors, especially from Europe and America.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Particularly with the new measure that China is increasingly opening up visa-free visits from a lot of the overseas countries. That would give Hong Kong tremendous advantages, because people can come to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong going into the mainland,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland has recently been offering more countries visa-free travel, the latest being Australia and New Zealand following Premier Li Qiang's visit to the two countries earlier this month..

    HK may need southern hemisphere flu jabs

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Respiratory health expert David Hui on Saturday said Hong Kong may have to use different flu jabs if the flu season continues until the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Professor Hui said many people had been vaccinated so outbreaks have not been large in scale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the SAR may also need to import vaccines from the Southern Hemisphere, where it is currently winter and the main flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If small-scale outbreaks continue - from the beginning of the year until the end - we'll have to import southern hemisphere vaccines in the second quarter of the year, and import northern hemisphere vaccines in the fourth quarter," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui added that people who had not been vaccinated during winter, could still get their vaccines now.

    Taxi fleets must maintain service quality: government

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said the service quality of some taxi drivers was disappointing, but he expects the situation to improve with the introduction of a licensed taxi fleet system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government is expected to approve up to five licences out of 15 applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Lam said taxi fleets must maintain their service quality level to keep the licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Transport Department will monitor the taxi fleets to see whether they are performing well and offer reminders if they are not. In the worst case scenario, we can cancel their licence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's a monitoring system, so I'm confident the taxi fleets will provide a high-quality service and therefore enhance the service quality for the whole taxi industry."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also said the authorities are looking into whether licences are needed for ride-hailing services. He said discussions will be made with the sector and lawmakers in July.

    Being the Chief Executive is a mission, says John Lee

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says he has nothing else in mind but to complete his mission and accomplish the best results during his tenure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Asked about whether he would seek re-election during a media interview, the SAR leader said "being the Chief Executive is a mission". Lee's current five-year term ends in June 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this mission, there is only one thought. You execute your tasks to the best of your abilities; always be dedicated, selfless and try to do as much as possible. Treat that as your only mission, think about nothing else and you will achieve the best results and satisfy the mission's requirements," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's top official also refused to rate his own performance, only saying he would leave it to others to assess his work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if there had been difficult calls to make over the past two years, Lee said none of the decisions were easy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm pleased to see that so far I get a lot of support from my team, which helps me in making difficult decisions. And I am thankful to a lot of people who are very willing to offer their opinions to me. That also helps me to make difficult decisions," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But all decisions are difficult. There's no easy thing for the Chief Executive, when I have to take care of the interests of 7.5 million people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Likewise, Lee felt it was hard to gauge the individual performances of his cabinet officials, given that "each policy has a different starting point". That said, he acknowledged all of them had met his requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would describe my team as a boat. This boat, firstly, has to move forward. Secondly, it has to move faster and faster. Thirdly, and most importantly, it has to be in the right direction. If it's in the right direction, we will eventually reach our destination. If [the boat] is faster, we'll get there faster," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After [reaching] one goal, we move on to the next and handle things one step at a time."

    Vital to prepare for economic transition, says CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has stressed the need to rethink how Hong Kong should position itself amid an economic transition, while warning of challenges brought by geopolitical uncertainties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Having served nearly two years in office, the city's leader said it's important to quickly identify ways to address changes the SAR is now experiencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must try to shorten the awakening and recognition phases as much as possible,” Lee said in a media interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we see changes, instead of remaining in the old way of thinking, it is better to recognise early that it is time to transform and acknowledge the need to make changes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR leader noted, for example, some businesses have stopped chasing sales figures and are now looking for ways to improve service quality instead .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After completing "the most important political task" of passing Basic Law Article 23 legislation, Hong Kong can now focus on the economy and people's livelihood, Lee added, noting the economy has rebounded from contractions when he first took office in July 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Chief Executive cautioned the SAR would continue to be affected by geopolitical uncertainties, as well as foreign interference in the city’s affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[There is] no use [for foreign countries] to try to make use of Hong Kong as a political tool to try to, for example, pressure our country or pressure Hong Kong, in order to achieve their political purpose... It will backfire, because by doing that, they lose their credibility in their own citizens," Lee warned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sound financial development is also key to avoid political instability, Lee added, judging from his exchanges with consuls-general in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, he confirmed plans to embark on more duty visits overseas. His cabinet will start with regions which "bring the best return", such as Asean member nations and the Middle East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Europe is a "big region" that the SAR must tap into, while Central Asia is another area of interest, if time permits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Finding time to cover that wide range of visits is a big challenge as well. There will be some division of labour… among government officials, and also… between the government and private sectors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In respect of raising the reputation and telling the good Hong Kong story to different countries, the private sector, of course, plays an important role as well, because they have their own network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have also, through their network, built up strong links with different opinion leaders as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee vowed to continue seeking support for Hong Kong's accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, as around 70 percent of the city's trade is conducted with economies under the pact.

    Chris Tang accuses RFA of endangering security

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Tang says whether charges would be brought against the station would depend on the evidence. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758497_1_20240621205748.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Security Chris Tang on Friday accused Radio Free Asia (RFA) of endangering national security by spreading misleading and false information in its report on the renewal of smart ID cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The news agency published an article accusing the government of "threatening" overseas Hongkongers, saying they could face jail if they didn't return to Hong Kong to renew their cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the government said the station was confusing different laws - and those who don't renew on time will only be fined HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said whether charges would be brought against the station would depend on the evidence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At first, I didn't understand why the outlet left Hong Kong [after Article 23]. Now I know why. It's because the relevant ordinance targets those endangering national security and the security of Hong Kong," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But you see, what this outlet does from afar is that it uses inaccurate information, and comes up with ways to incite the people to distrust or hate the government. These are exactly the sort of potentially illegal activities that we target in safeguarding national security."

 Overall consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in May year-on-year, up slightly from the 1.1 percent increase recorded in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Census and Statistics Department figures released on Friday showed there was a 20.1 percent increase in the price of alcoholic drinks and tobacco, a 3 percent rise in the price of meals out and takeaways, and a 2.3 percent increase in transport costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesperson said inflation should remain contained in the near future, but domestic cost pressures may increase as the local economy continues to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "External price pressures should continue to stay on a broad moderating trend, though geopolitical tensions may bring uncertainties. The government will continue to monitor the situation," the spokesperson said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The authorities on Friday said builders put up the wrong pre-fabricated wall while constructing subsidised flats in Yuen Long and have since been told to fix the mistake.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos posted on social media recently showed the incorrect wall at Long Tin Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Housing Department said the construction firm had mixed up two walls of the same size that have different window designs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The structure of the building is unaffected because the pre-fabricated wall involved is a non-structural component," it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the Housing Authority's construction team will closely monitor the performance of the contractor to ensure the safety and quality of the estate, which is due to be completed in early 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department stressed that the authorities have a good system for managing construction contracts, as well as stringent inspection procedures to ensure the quality of buildings.

    Proposed changes to harbour protection laws revised

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Protection of the Harbour Ordinance limits reclamation in Victoria Harbour to projects that have an overriding public need. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758429_1_20240621130818.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has revised its proposal to relax a general ban on reclamation in Victoria Harbour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Originally, it suggested that temporary reclamation projects with an area of up to three hectares should be exempt from harbour protection laws, as long as each phase of the project lasts no more than three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a new paper submitted to Legco, the Development Bureau notes that it didn't propose a cap on the number of phases each project could have and in light of this, it is suggesting a seven-year limit for the total duration of a project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reclamation work could be extended for a year if approval is granted by the financial secretary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau is also proposing to exempt three types of harbour enhancement work from the "presumption against reclamation", covering the construction of ramps, spaces for boat repairs, and wave absorbing infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Harbour-improvement" reclamation involving less than 0.8 hectares would also be exempt from protection laws under the government's proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Andrew Lam, the vice-chair of Legco's development panel, said the proposed seven-year limit for projects exemptions will ensure that temporary reclamation doesn't end up being permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It would provide a better certainty to put the cap at seven years. That would be better than a three plus three and... another three... which eventually goes nowhere," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he believes the law changes will enable more harbourfront projects to be launched.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, the government actually tried not to start any project because of the risk of being taken to court by any individual who believes the nature of the project does not have the need for the well-being of the society as a whole," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bill to amend the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance is expected to be submitted to Legco by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Kwong Wah Hospital said a malfunction in the backup power system for the operating theatres was the main cause of a power disruption on Wednesday evening that affected 25 non-urgent surgeries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty-three elective surgeries scheduled on Thursday had to be postponed and two other elective surgeries were moved to other operating rooms, the hospital said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that while the main power supply was working fine, it had decided to shut down eight operating theatres as a precaution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Preliminary investigation by the contractor who installed the electricity supply system revealed that there was a malfunction of the control components in the uninterrupted power supply system which is the third tier backup power supply source and this malfunction affected the operation of the third tier backup power supply system in the operating theatres," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by the incident, 23 elective surgeries originally scheduled for [Thursday] needed to be postponed and two elective surgeries needed to be transferred to another unaffected operating theatres. The two surgeries were both performed uneventfully.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson said that the contractor had replaced the faulty components in the system and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department was conducting independent tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the affected surgeries were expected to gradually resume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital added the patient who was moved to another theatre when the outage happened on Wednesday had a complication, but it said that was not related to being moved.

    Eric Chan says skilled worker policies bearing fruit

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan said government policies to attract skilled workers were bearing fruit, with the number far exceeding the 35,000 annual target set by the chief executive. Chan said about 120,000 people had already moved here through different migration schemes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary was speaking in an interview with RTHK to mark the second anniversary of the current administration's term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past year or so, we've successfully attracted over 300,000 applications. If we include the applicants' family members, we estimate some 700,000 people will come to the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are all talents. Frankly, they're voting with their feet, showing their confidence in Hong Kong. I believe this shows our outstanding advantages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This week, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development said Hong Kong had risen to fifth in its competitiveness ranking with Chan saying this was proof that, in the eyes of the international community, the SAR was gradually moving forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said he thought people making cross-border leisure trips to Shenzhen was a form of patriotic education, especially for the young.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We cannot hard sell patriotism. It must be a soft sell - through things like exhibitions, movies, music, interviews and visits - for young people to genuinely feel that the country's improved," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So many people go north of the border to consume nowadays. This is also a form of patriotic education, because once they go north to have a look, they can know more about the country and its improvements."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief secretary said, ultimately, patriotism needs to become "a mainstream core value".

    Think-tanks call for more support for entrepreneurs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A researcher with the Our Hong Kong Foundation says young SAR entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more work experience. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758386_1_20240621091224.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think-tanks are urging Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more training and job placements to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move comes after a research team from the Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation visited two entrepreneurial bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou in September. They were set up to support young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kynita Wong is the foundation's assistant researcher, who travelled to Guangzhou with the team. Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, she said one of the challenges was that the centres were offering services that were too similar.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From our visit to entrepreneur bases we observed there's a tendency towards homogeneity. And because the services offered are pretty similar, the convergence of the bases make it difficult for the young entrepreneurs to choose suitable incubation centres," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also because the entrepreneur bases are relying on the rental and service fees so they provide more of a basic service but not much of an investment function."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said these challenges hindered the ability of the entrepreneurs to fully capitalise on the opportunities available in Guangzhou, which was why they are asking for more support from authorities on both sides of the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The first one that we recommend to provide is the short-term employment skills training in related industries to help youth acquire the relevant skills and experience," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are trying to propose the use of the 'employment first, entrepreneurship later' model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said during their training, the young entrepreneurs would gain a better understanding of society on the mainland and this would help them to create networks.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 84 people in a three-day operation targeting the illegal use of electric mobility devices in northern New Territories.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 76, were nabbed on suspicion of various offences, such as driving an unregistered vehicle, driving without a licence, and using a vehicle without third-party insurance. All of them have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers also seized 69 electric bikes and 15 e-scooters. Around one-third of them were allegedly used for food delivery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting chief inspector Ngai Siu-cheong also noted that the battery-propelled devices were commonly used by parents with young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that many parents would use these electric mobility devices to drop off or pick up their children from school and for daily commute. Some even modified their electric bikes by adding more seats. In some cases, the parents would carry two to three kids on one bicycle," Ngai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the speed of such powered devices could reach up to 50 kilometres per hour. Many arrested parents did not have a valid driving licence either, meaning they could not properly follow the signs and rules, endangering other road users.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's jobless rate stood unchanged at three percent in the three-month period ending in May.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The underemployment rate edged up slightly to 1.2 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the February-April period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department on Thursday showed that about 2,500 people became jobless during the latest period, taking the tally to 116,200, while the number of underemployed people rose by 4,200 to 44,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Notable increases in the underemployment rate were observed in sectors including decoration, repair, building maintenance, cleaning, arts, entertainment and recreation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Total employment, meanwhile, increased by about 2,800 to about 3.69 million, and the labour force also increased by about 5,300 to 3.81 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest data, Labour Secretary Chris Sun said the jobless rate remained low.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city's labour market "should stay tight in the near term alongside the continued economic growth".

    Hong Kong embraces ethnic diversity: Eric Chan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Eric Chan says the government has enhanced support for ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=25&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758296_1_20240620162803.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary for Administration Eric Chan on Thursday said Hong Kong was a metropolis that embraced ethnic diversity, amid calls for more support for minorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony unveiling the Diversity List, which honoured 21 people with an ethnic minority background for their contributions to the city, Chan said the government had enhanced support for minorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Chief Executive, in his Policy Address last year, expanded the government's support for our ethnic minority communities in education, employment, integration into the community and support services," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That includes setting up two additional support service centres. Eight ethnic minority care teams will begin service next month, with two others expected to be in place by year’s end."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shalini Mahtani, the founder and the CEO of The Zubin Foundation, an NGO which aims to improve the lives of marginalised communities in the city, urged the government to include ethnic minorities in the campaign of "telling the good stories of Hong Kong".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To ask the government to use multi-ethnic faces and stories to tell the Hong Kong stories. Because there are so many great stories in this community, and to use these faces and these stories both locally and internationally," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Diversity List, which was launched by The Zubin Foundation, featured 21 people from seven ethnic groups and across a wide range of expertise, such as financial services, legal services and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong-born Saajandeep Singh, who was one of the honourees and an admitted solicitor in the SAR, called on the government to increase the number of ethnic minorities on its care teams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the government can always offer more support. They are doing great initiatives at the moment, but obviously they will need to provide more funding to ensure that these programmes continue and they are far-reaching, and they are not only in specific areas of Hong Kong, but they are district-wide," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that they have ethnic minority care teams nowadays, but I think they will need a greater number of people involved in these teams."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="University tuition fees to rise 17.6% over three years" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758283_1_20240620145406.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tuition fees at public universities will increase by HK$2,400 next year, with further rises of around the same amount planned for each of the following two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After an almost three-decade-long freeze in annual fees, the current HK$42,100 charge for undergraduate and postgraduate programmes will rise to HK$44,500 in 2025/26, HK$47,000 in 2026/27 and HK$49,500 in 2027/28 – an increase of almost 17.6 percent over the three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For sub-degree programmes, the current HK$15,040 will reach HK$17,800 by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson on Thursday said the administration is working to strike a balance between maintaining its fiscal discipline and ensuring that higher education remains affordable for students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the last tuition fees adjustment in the 1997/98 academic year, the Composite Consumer Price Index has increased by 40 percent cumulatively. Comparatively, the tuition fees adjustment is very modest this time," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The UGC-funded universities provide other financial assistance such as scholarships, bursaries and loans to needy students to ensure that no qualified students will be denied access to higher education due to financial difficulties."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration also said its target cost recovery rate for tuition fee levels of 18 percent, set in the early 1990s, had been declining due to more expenditure being needed to deliver higher education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The rate is projected to drop to 12.5 percent in the next academic year, before improving slightly in 2027 to 13.4 percent following the tuition fee increases, the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan stressed that the decision to put up fees has nothing to do with the government's budget deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We haven't adjusted the tuition fee for more than 20 years, so we believe there is a need to moderately adjust the tuition fee. Our goal is to subsidise students with 82 percent of their tuition fee, but we are above this target," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our plan is to increase the fees in the upcoming three years. We don't have any plan to increase the fees after three years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Think tank Our Hong Kong Foundation welcomed the move, while calling for more support for students from lower-income families.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 5.5 percent [average annual increase] is somewhat mild, because we are talking about inflation of about two to three percent. We are just slightly above that, trying to catch up a little bit, in terms of the cost recovery," said Victor Kwok, the group's assistant research director.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, on the other hand, as they gradually increase the tuition fees, they also have to proportionally increase their support, in terms of students loans, and in terms of student grants, for students from relatively less well-off families."

    Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Miniature art exhibition to showcase HK landmarks" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=35&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758281_1_20240620144721.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A miniature artist on Thursday said that an exhibition showcasing unique Central and Western District landmarks would deepen people's understanding of Hong Kong's rich history and development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Look Closer and Wonder: Central and Western District in Miniature" exhibition will display 22 artworks, with nine pieces new to the collection, in celebration of the 27th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carmen Poon, president of the Joyful Miniature Association, hoped the artworks could give people a fresh perspective of familiar sites in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Central and Western District is very unique. First of all, because it is the heart of Hong Kong's political, economic, financial centre and it's also a cultural centre. From this area, you can see the earliest transportation, colonial architecture and also in terms of food, for example, you have cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong style cafe) and you also have a lot of declared monuments like the Man Mo Temple," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand, you have the most classic and oldest [buildings], and on the other hand, you have the highest skyscrapers all at once. It's a melting pot of East meets West. You have Lan Kwai Fong out there, it's the gist of Hong Kong, everything that is the best is here, in Central and Western District."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One artist Hung Fai-chan spent a year recreating the corridors of an old public housing estate called "We All Grew Up Like This". He said he wanted to capture the memories of childhood games, before electronics, that many Hong Kong people grew up with.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a lot of my own memories inside this piece too because I also grew up in public housing. I have a few siblings myself so I wanted to capture the childhood games we used to play, like rock, paper, scissors up the stairs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are also simpler games like marble shooting or even table tennis on the ground. These are all the games we would play as a child, like many children in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another artist Tim Ho worked with a team to recreate the Man Mo Temple in Sheung Wan. He said the project was challenging given its meticulous craftsmanship that took numerous site visits and extensive research to create the replica. He added the temple is an iconic landmark, so he hoped a lot of tourists would admire their artwork.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want people to see that it is no different from the actual Man Mo Temple. We tried our best to really capture all the details of the temple. We want people to know that there is such a beautiful piece of architecture in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The beauty of our artwork is that it captures an angle you can't see fully in real life. It is usually crowded at the temple so you can't see it when it is empty. You also can't see all the little details. You will see the entire structure from a giant's perspective."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition will be held in Admiralty from June 21 to July 8.

    'HK entrepreneurs in Guangzhou need more help'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Think tanks on Thursday urged Hong Kong and mainland authorities to provide more assistance to young people from the SAR who start businesses in Guangzhou.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Coalition and the Our Hong Kong Foundation said that as of July 2023, there were 52 entrepreneurial bases in Guangzhou for young entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Macau, with about 2,100 start-up projects underway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A research team from the two groups visited two bases in the Nansha and Tianhe districts of Guangzhou and talked to about 10 Hong Kong entrepreneurs working in various industries there, including arts and culture, technology and catering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s assistant research director, Victor Kwok, said some Hong Kong startups there lack knowledge about the business environment and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are gaps that we observe, such as the difference between the skills, knowledge, experiences and the network of the entrepreneurs and the actual requirements of actually having the business to prosper,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok highlighted challenges arising from changes in rules and policies on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We all know comparatively in the mainland, the policy change is sometimes faster than what is observed in Hong Kong, and that could be a challenge, because sometimes you apply for funding and then the policy itself expires before you actually get the funding,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok said a single, easy-to-use government application or website would be beneficial for entrepreneurs to keep themselves updated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Incubators in Guangzhou should also be more proactive in assisting startups to apply for funding from the mainland government, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation and coalition also complained that all the entrepreneurial bases offer identical services. They said authorities should differentiate them based on the startups’ development stage or industry type, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect with the right industry players.

    CUHK develops mRNA drug for nasopharyngeal cancer

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Researchers say the new drug is better than current treatments because it can minimise damage to healthy cells. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758269_1_20240620134352.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scientists at Chinese University on Thursday said they had developed a new drug that had the potential to cause nasopharyngeal cancer cells to destroy themselves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The drug uses mRNA bio-technology, which acts like a code to activate the death cycle of cancer cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scientists carried out tests on mice and said the results were very promising. They described the drug as a "smart bomb" because it not only targets cancer cells, but also attracts immune cells to help eliminate them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Anne Tsang, one of the researchers, said this new drug is better than current treatments because it could minimise damage to healthy cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the traditional treatments are mostly systemic. They are chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and so they affect not only the cancer cells, but also the other normal cells," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For our drug, this drug mechanism will only target the cancer cells that are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus. So the normal cells will be safe...and so our human body will feel [many fewer] side effects, and so the patients can have a much better quality of life."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nasopharyngeal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the throat, specifically the part that connects the back of the nose to the back of the mouth. It is often called "Canton cancer" because it is more common in southern China.

    Health minister concerned about hospital power outage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau on Thursday said the hardware of all hospitals needs to be of very high quality, to ensure that patients receive proper treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comment came after a power outage lasting almost an hour at Kwong Wah Hospital on Wednesday night. The redeveloped building was only completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Staff carrying out surgery had to move to another room, while 25 other operations were rescheduled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said there will be a probe into what exactly went wrong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The quality of construction works and hardware indeed affects our medical services. The Hospital Authority and the hospital will investigate to find out what the problems were technically," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical and health services sector lawmaker David Lam said the problem could be the fault of builders. After the hospital building opened last year, issues with electricity cables were discovered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not expect a new hospital to have a general power outage problem like that," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If that is a systematic problem with the engineering system, or the monitoring system while the building was being constructed, then I believe that's a big issue."

    Rule of law intact despite judges leaving: SJ

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice chief Paul Lam said the recent resignations of overseas non-permanent judges from Hong Kong's top court would not undermine the city's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two UK judges – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Jonathan Sumption – resigned from the Court of Final Appeal earlier this month, and Beverley McLachlin from Canada said she would not stay on when her term expires at the end of July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, the secretary for justice said foreign legal experts were still confident in the SAR's judicial system, noting that two other overseas judges had joined the bench since the implementation of the national security law in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's normal for people to come and go. So, don't just focus on people leaving. There are also judges who are extending their terms and new judges who are joining," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the departure of the three judges, seven non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions remain at the Court of Final Appeal. The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there is no quota on the number of overseas non-permanent judges sitting on the top court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Basic Law does not state that there must be eight or 10 non-permanent overseas judges on the court over a long period of time. I think quality is the most important. We are not looking at the numbers. In fact, we invite judges who are internationally prestigious and can help Hong Kong develop what is called jurisprudence, which is the quality of the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the arrests made by the police in the past month over the publishing of social media posts ahead of a "sensitive date" for alleged sedition under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, Lam said the government is not targetting specific dates but the intention of an act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No matter what day or time it is, if your behaviour constitutes a crime with an incitement intent, then there's a risk you will be charged. We are targetting the words and actions. It doesn't matter what day. The day you come out and say you support 'Hong Kong independence' or want to subvert state power, there's a chance you violate the law," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Elizabeth Hospital said on Wednesday it had launched an investigation after a blunder involving a feeding tube that left a patient fighting for his life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said the 61-year-old man was being treated in an orthopaedic ward and required a nasogastric tube to receive formula milk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson said the tube was inserted by a nurse on Sunday at noon and replaced in the evening in accordance with procedures. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated early on Tuesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Doctors immediately performed resuscitation and arranged bronchoscopy examination for the patient, where a nasogastric tube was found placed in his bronchus,” the spokesperson added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient was taken to the High Dependency Unit before being moved to intensive care. On Wednesday, his condition was said to be critical.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The hospital is saddened by the incident,” the spokesperson said. “QEH has met with the patient’s family to explain the incident, extend sincere apologies and express deep empathy. QEH will continue to closely communicate with the patient’s family and provide necessary assistance.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority. A panel has been set up to investigate and recommend improvements within eight weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Kwong Wah Hospital said that it had called off 25 elective surgeries scheduled for Thursday after a power cut hit some of its operating theatres on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One surgery had to be moved to a different theatre during the cut, which started at 7pm and lasted for 50 minutes. It’s getting in touch with the affect patients and has apologised. Other services were not affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident has been reported to the Hospital Authority.

    'Tuition hike moderate but adds to students' burden'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sources say university tuition could go up from five to nine percent each year over three years. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758175_2_20240619205709.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A potential increase in university tuition fees has drawn mixed views from students and lawmakers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government intends to roll out a phased fee increase over the next three years, with annual increments ranging from five to nine percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lucy Ng, a third-year student at the University of Hong Kong, said she wants her school to put the money to good use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As a student, of course, I hope the school can keep the current tuition fee. But if our school insists to have this increase, I hope they can explain how they will use this fee. Are they going to build any new facilities?" she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another HKU student, Emily, who majors in social work, said a tuition hike would increase the financial burden on students who rely on loans, such as herself.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm currently taking the government loan... They are burdened with the loans, so they have to repay in many years when they work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It will definitely enhance the financial burden of students, so I don't think it's a very good act for the university to increase tuition fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lau Chi-peng, who’s also Associate Vice-President at Lingnan University, described the proposed increase as moderate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two considerations: whether it would impose a burden on students and families, as well as the magnitude of the increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It appears that the increase would be moderate and the process would be gradual. There would also be corresponding adjustments in government financial assistance, which could potentially involve extending the repayment period," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Education sector lawmaker Chu Kwok-keung urged the government to consider the affordability of students and parents before finalising the tuition proposal, to prevent “turning student loans into student debts.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Priscilla Leung of the Business and Professionals Alliance, who chairs Legco's education panel, called on society to accept the increase, in light of the government's budget deficit amounting to billions of dollars.

 Wildlife officials have captured two wild boars that were spotted wandering around Sham Shui Po on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) used dart guns during the capture operation near Sheung Li Uk Garden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they received a report at around 10.10am when the pigs were seen at the junction of Tai Po Road and Nam Cheong Street, near a petrol station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The boars were said to have later moved to the garden, located along Tai Po Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online footage showed police officers at the scene using shields for protection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Considering that the presence of the two wild boars in urban areas would pose a danger to the public, our staff captured and euthanised them,” an AFCD spokesperson said.

    Govt moves full steam ahead with new incinerator

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government says it is working at full speed to get Hong Kong's first mega waste incinerator up and running next year, as it plans to stop using landfills for waste disposal by 2035.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Department led a press tour to a man-made island near Lantau where the incinerator, called I-PARK1, is being built.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant Director for Environmental Protection, Michael Lui, said the plant will be able to recover heat energy from the incineration process to generate electricity for 100,000 homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In early next year, we plan to carry out a testing commissioning with a view so that we can operate the plant by the end of next year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we can at least achieve the very important step that we implement the first mega incinerator in Hong Kong to handle at least 3,000 tonnes of waste [each day]," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another incinerator, capable of processing about 6,000 tonnes of waste per day, will be built near Tuen Mun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said construction could be completed two years ahead of schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui said both incinerators will use new technology to ensure that emissions meet international standards and do not harm people's health or the surrounding environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to the government's plans, an environmental group said burning garbage should be the last resort, and isn't an alternative to reducing waste and increasing recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said opening two massive incinerators risks sending the wrong message to the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said Hong Kong currently disposes of around 11,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste on average per day, and if the goal to gradually reduce the per capita disposal rate by around 45 percent is achieved, the amount would drop to about 6,100 tonnes a day – below the capacity of the two incinerators of 9,000 tonnes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only if the government thinks that their strategy action set out in the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035 is useless, otherwise the waste generation amount and the waste that requires disposal will be greatly reduced by 45 percent. This is not by the end of the blueprint timeline 2035, if reduced by 45 percent, it is saying very clearly it is a mid-term target," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means by 2026 or 2027, this is a mid-term, then the government can already get the city to achieve this target. So I don't know why the government still needs to propose even the 6,000 tonnes, the second incinerator, which is really overcapacity."

    Lawmakers bemoan 'useless' workplace accident fines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun said there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents since maximum fines for safety law breaches were introduced last year." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758129_1_20240619153422.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies involved in industrial accidents are not being punished strongly enough for safety law breaches despite an increase in the maximum penalty, lawmakers complained on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Last year, the highest penalty for a serious violation of occupational safety laws was raised from a fine of HK$500,000, to HK$10 million and a two-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour Secretary Chris Sun said since the law change, there have been prosecutions over eight fatal workplace accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one case that has concluded, two company bosses were fined HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of lawmakers said such a punishment is too lenient, with president of the Federation of Trade Unions Stanley Ng saying it shows last year's law change is "useless" when it comes to preventing industrial accidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said regarding the pair fined HK$50,000, officials decided they would not have a strong case should they decide to appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is considered the sentences were not wrong in principle and the fines were not manifestly inadequate," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that it has only been a little more than a year since the legal changes were made and appealed to lawmakers to wait longer to see what effect the higher punishments have.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that officials will review the matter in around a year's time.

    Govt to raise university tuition fees over three years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources said the government plans to raise university tuition fees over the coming three years, with annual increases of between five and nine percent.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Education Secretary Christine Choi had previously said it was time to raise the HK$42,100 annual tuition fee for local students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions, as it had remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the increase would be phased in as early as next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the current fee covers only 13 percent of the total cost and the government's target is for the fee to cover 18 percent of the cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi met with some lawmakers to explain the plan, with the government expected to make an announcement on the matter soon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said the number of business outlets remained stable in recent years, despite claims Hong Kong was going through a wave of shop closures due to a sluggish economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Commerce minister Algernon Yau made the comment when responding to a written question from lawmaker Andrew Lam, who noted that netizens had opened a social media group on the closures, with more than 300,000 users joining the group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau noted there were more than 95,000 outlets in the catering, retail, beauty and hairdressing sectors at the end of last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of establishments of these industries had once recorded a drop owing to the impact of the epidemic in the last few years, but it has rebounded since the end of 2021 to remain stable with the epidemic subsiding in recent years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials do not keep records of shop openings and closures and that these were business decisions based on a number of factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said as small to medium enterprises faced challenges, due to more Hongkongers travelling north of the border to consume, the administration had been providing help through a number of measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include low-interest concessionary loans of nearly HK$19 billion to ensure these companies could maintain steady cash flow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would continue to closely monitor the situation, and help firms "ride out the storm".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The ex-husband of a fashion influencer found dead in 2023 was on Wednesday sentenced to 42 months in prison for stealing gold and jewellery worth more than HK$6 million and jumping bail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alex Kwong, ex-husband of Abby Choi, pleaded guilty in the District Court to stealing necklaces, bracelets, pendants, bullion and gold pellets between June 2013 and January 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court heard that Kwong falsely claimed to be engaged in a mainland gold investment business and stole items from six people he persuaded to buy jewellery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While on bail following his arrest in 2015, he failed to report to police as instructed and didn't turn up for a court hearing that year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was arrested in February 2023 at a pier in the New Territories while allegedly trying to flee the city by speedboat following Choi's death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong admitted failing to surrender to custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passing sentence, Judge David Cheung said Kwong's series of crimes over a period of 1.5 years  was not due to momentary greed, but deliberate action to steal from others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung noted that the defendant had since compensated the victims for their losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwong, along with his father and brother are charged with murdering Choi, while Kwong's mother faces a charge of perverting the course of justice in relation to the case.

    'Hong Kong to act as window to promote hydrogen use'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan says the development of hydrogen helps Hong Kong gain business opportunities. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1758087_1_20240619111244.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said it would be difficult for Hong Kong to pursue large-scale production and usage of hydrogen, but the city could act as the mainland's showcase to the international community.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, the minister said limited space in Hong Kong made it difficult for the mass production of hydrogen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Tse said the SAR could leverage its unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong can act as a window, a base for demonstration, to promote hydrogen products overseas. The international community can also come to Hong Kong for financing when it needs to," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hydrogen development is not only for us and helping us to pursue carbon neutrality, but it is also an opportunity for business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government earlier announced its strategy on hydrogen development, aimed at addressing climate change and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with 14 trial projects in the pipeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the administration is now looking into which industries would be suitable and cost-effective to use hydrogen, which is relatively pricey, and will formulate standards and guidelines.
