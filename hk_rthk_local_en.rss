<div class="itemFullText">
 Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet were the last shuttlers from Hong Kong to bow out of the Paris Olympics, as they shared an emotional moment following defeat in the mixed doubles quarter-final.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The long-time partners on the court were brushed aside in straight games by the third-seeded pair of Chae Yu-jung and Seo Seung-jae.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Koreans needed just 39 minutes to finish off the SAR duo, winning 21-15, 21-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang and Tse went down by as much as 9-16 in the opening game, before taking five of the next seven points to go within 14-18. They never got closer than that, however, and the Koreans hung on to win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chae and Seo then asserted control of game two with a 8-1 run, and never relinquished the lead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both Tang and Tse had trouble holding back tears while meeting the press afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse, who said she's grateful just to compete in Paris, revealed for the first time that she was in a hospital emergency ward "two, three weeks ago" but did not specify the reason.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Perhaps in the past month, I've cried every single day while on the court. Jordan withstood a lot from me," Tse said as she briefly lost her composure in front of cameras.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I couldn't even squeeze a toothpaste ... or comb my hair."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also heaped praise on Tang, saying without him she might have retired a long time ago. Tang, for his part, Tang thanked Tse for not giving up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I also picked up bumps and bruises here and there so I understand how difficult it is ... Returning to a high level after injury is never easy, yet she's done it many times."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added they've been under immense pressure in the past year or so punching their Paris tickets, as they had trailed so much in the rankings.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey snagged another bronze medal on Thursday in the women’s 100 metres freestyle event in Paris, making her the first Hongkonger to clinch four Olympic medals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Haughey stayed around the front of the pack throughout the first 50 metres, and was able to pull herself into second place behind the fast-starting American Torri Huske at the turn.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pushed through the last 50 metres and was in contention thoughout to grab a spot on the podium with a time of 52.33 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sweden’s world record holder Sarah Sjoestroem surged through to claim the gold with a time of 52.16 seconds, while Huske was 0.13 seconds back to pip Haughey for silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey told reporters that she knew it would be a highly competitive race, so she just wanted to focus on enjoying the whole process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that my training for this race in the past few years was more intense compared to the Tokyo Olympics. I practiced a lot more in terms of training time, number of minutes, and distance. Especially as you get older, your body recovery is getting worse," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Children watching TV, everyone needs to add oil (keep going). The whole journey may not be easy, but if you have a dream, just keep chasing it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey earlier won the bronze in the 200 metres freestyle event, as well as two silver medals at the Tokyo Olympics in the same respective events.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sjoestroem, who set the world record back in 2017, had only committed to join the 100 metres at the last minute having previously indicated she'd focus on her favoured 50m free.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu has concluded his maiden Olympic campaign on Wednesday, after losing to old rival Chou Tien-chen of Chinese Taipei in their group stage finale.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee was sent packing after 12th-seeded Chou wrapped up a 21-18, 21-13 victory in 44 minutes to reach the last 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  World number 17 Lee, who was beaten by Chou in eight of their 12 previous matchups, mostly played catch-up in their latest encounter. The SAR shuttler came back from six points down in the opening game to make it 18-19, before his opponent delivered perfect smashes to take the set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chou once again moved in front 12-6 in the ensuing game, and Lee failed to erase the deficit the rest of the way.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the press after the match, Lee said he felt he could have done better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was rather up and down emotionally ... I give myself too much pressure, I wanted to prove myself to others," he conceded, holding back tears.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Before arriving [in Paris], I told my coaches, this is my only chance to prove to the world who Lee Cheuk-yiu is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to address his weaknesses and consistency issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the La Chapelle Arena in Paris, Chinese Taipei veteran Tai Tzu-ying suffered a shocking group stage exit in the women's singles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world number three who bagged silver in Tokyo was stunned by Ratchanok Intanon from Thailand in straight games, 19-21, 15-21.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai, who was battling multiple injuries, burst into tears after the match but shared a warm embrace with her opponent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I did my best, based on my condition at this year's Games," a tearful Tai told reporters from Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think I can say that I have tried my best. But of course, speed-wise I was unable to catch up to my opponent."

    Warnings before enforcement over illegal feeding

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government said verbal warnings will be given before enforcement action for a month after an amendment to the city’s wildlife protection law takes effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Legislative Council passed the Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill in May, raising the maximum penalty of feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will be a fixed penalty of HK$5,000 for illegal feeding, and the ban will be extended to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new law takes effect on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on Wednesday that officers will issue verbal warnings before taking enforcement actions when they find any illegal feeding activity from August 1 to 31.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Starting from September 1, enforcement officers will take enforcement action immediately without prior verbal warning if any person is found to be illegally feeding feral pigeons or wild animals,” it said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition to the police and AFCD officers, appointed officers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Housing Department can also take enforcement action against illegal feeding, the AFCD noted.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance says workers are at risk of falling unwell when working outdoors in the summer. Photo courtesy of the Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764102_1_20240731195342.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A concern group on Wednesday urged the Labour Department to beef up its guidelines on working under hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department issued the "Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work” more than a year ago, outlining the criteria for outdoor workers to take hourly breaks during extreme conditions to prevent heatstroke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An updated version was issued earlier this year, aligning the department’s warning system to the Hong Kong Observatory's "extremely hot special weather tips".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the document also states that employers or contractors could abolish breaks for workers if certain measures are implemented to prevent heatstroke, such as providing drinking water, cooling vests and portable fans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Concern for Grassroots' Livelihood Alliance said 90 percent of 100 cleaners responding to their recent survey said they felt unwell even when preventive measures were in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to social worker Au Yee-wing from the alliance, many cleaners said the guidelines failed to address their needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said, for example, that employees working in extreme hot weather wearing protective suits are granted extra rest time, but those wearing only masks are not.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Street cleaners wear masks while working in the hot environment. We suggest the Labour Department review the guidelines, allowing cleaners to increase their rest time," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au added that cleaners often have heavy workloads, making it even more difficult for them to take breaks.

    Ng pulls out of triathlon, ending maiden Olympic run

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s Jason Ng did not finish the triathlon race which took place under the blazing Paris heat, ending his maiden Olympic journey.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng completed the 1,500-metre swim in 24 minutes and 6 seconds, with a transition time of 51 seconds before starting the 40-kilometre bike ride.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He did not finish the course and was eliminated before putting on his running shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Ng said his performance suit's zipper was pulled off during the triathlon competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the midst of the competition, my trisuit was grabbed by someone and the zipper in the back was pulled off," Ng said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Water kept going into my suit, and it became like a parachute. The entire suit kept pulling me backwards, and it didn't help with the water resistance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Britain's Alex Yee pipped New Zealand's Hayden Wilde for an amazing victory in the event. The Tokyo silver medallist showed his pacing mastery of the 10-km run, passing a flagging Wilde with less than 400 metres to go in blazing sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The race had been postponed for a day due to the poor water quality of the Seine River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michel, a Mexican living in Paris who watched the race along Avenue des Champs-Élysées, said it was worth the wait.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I’m assuming that the people were testing the levels of bacteria. I had heard all of the things they needed to do properly so I’m glad that they did wait and it was well worth the wait. Honestly it was a great race,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kristen, a spectator from New Jersey, said she enjoyed watching the race but not the idea of swimming in the Seine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I'm glad that the sun was better for them today. I still think it's gross that they had to swim in that [river],” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, France's Cassandre Beaugrand won a historic gold in a thrilling women's individual triathlon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Switzerland's Julie Derron dug deep to win silver, while Great Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Wong Chun-ting of Hong Kong put up a good fight in his round-of-32 men's table tennis singles match at the Paris Olympics, but he was no match for second-seeded Fan Zhendong of China.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fan was off to a fast start, racing to a 2-0 lead by taking the first two games 11-5, 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong came to life in the third game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He jumped out to leads of 4-0 and 5-1 before holding on for an 11-9 victory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Fan simply proved too strong for his SAR opponent. He went on to capture the next two games 11-6, 11-3 to complete a 4-1 win in 36 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said after the match that this could well be his last Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Olympics this year is special. For one, I am already 33 years old, so I am considering this Olympics to be my last. Because for the next one, four years later, whether or not I can get the chance to compete is unknown, too much uncertainty," he said.

 Hong Kong table tennis player Zhu Chengzhu on Wednesday bowed out of the women's singles event at the Paris Olympics, losing 0-4 in her round of 32 match against Japan's Miu Hirano.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old kept it close in the first game, losing 13-11, but then lost the next three games, 11-5, 11-8, 11-9, in the match that lasted 38 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Zhu is choosing to look ahead, instead focusing on the positives despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel very happy this time, and I enjoyed every game," she said after the match. "I think it’s normal whether I win or lose – there will be a women’s team battle next, so I will prepare well for every game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Anything is possible because of this venue. Although I was not feeling as confident today, if I am confident, anything is possible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unseeded Zhu is next set to compete in the women's team round of 16 next Tuesday, when the Hong Kong, China team take on Sweden at South Paris Arena 4.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, according to official advance estimates released on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  That compares with a revised 2.8 percent expansion in the first quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government attributed the second quarter growth to an increase in exports and investment spending, saying it expects the economy to continue to expand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, the economy should continue to grow in the remainder of the year, but performance of the different economic segments may vary amid uncertainties on various fronts," a spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Meanwhile, heightened geopolitical tensions, escalating trade conflicts, and US interest rate trajectory remaining not entirely clear may add uncertainties to economic sentiment and activities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, Natixis Asia Pacific economist Gary Ng said the figure for the second quarter was slightly higher than he expected, but pressures still remain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the other components, such as the contraction in the household spending and also the greater growth in the import of services, which is basically reflecting the outbound tourism and also the rebound in investment, which basically just get back to the pre-Covid level and is still 16 percent lower than 2018 for the same period," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think these are all the sorts of pressures that I would see within the economy that can actually drag the growth rate further in the future."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific and HK Express passengers can now use their mobiles to check in baggage at the airport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using the airlines' apps, passengers can get a printed tag at special channels and drop off their luggage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The function is only available to people with electronic travel documents who are flying to places where they don't require a visa.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris Au Young, the general manager of data analytics at the Airport Authority, said the new bag drop service will save passengers time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So if we compare that method with the old method, the old method takes two minutes more. If we don't count any time used for lining up, the entire process is shortened from three minutes to only one," he told the media on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au Young said the authority hopes to expand the function so it can be used by 80 percent of passengers leaving Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it has developed a medical-grade smartphone stethoscope for early detection of valvular heart disease.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The faculty said the AI-powered software Vitogram has an estimated accuracy of 81 percent for detecting significant valvular disease, a level comparable to a doctor's assessment using a traditional stethoscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it does not replace the function of a doctor, you still need a doctor to perform comprehensive assessment on a patient for proper diagnosis, but our invention provides a very powerful disease screening tool," said Associate Professor Joshua Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vitogram uses AI to measure heart sounds from four parts of the chest, with each measurement taking approximately 10 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho described the tool as an "AI doctor in your pocket" that allows anyone to conveniently assess their own health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university's Dr. Wong Chun-Ka said Vitogram is among the first software able to record and analyse heart sounds, as opposed to just a person's heart rate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are able to detect structural diseases like valve disease, which is not possible using previous commercially available devices," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The university is hoping that Vitogram will be available on the market in the next six months to a year and is looking to partner with healthcare organisations in places including Singapore and Malaysia.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said Hong Kong will sign 13 agreements with Cambodia to boost trade and investment between the two places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Deputy Prime Minister Sar Sokha, Lee said Hong Kong will enhance collaboration with Cambodia across various sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The collaboration between Cambodia and Hong Kong will be closer than ever before. I'm confident we will work to further strengthen cooperation between the two governments, promote commerce, tourism, and cultural exchanges, strengthen people-to-people ties and jointly contribute to the development of the Belt and Road Initiative," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said that the Trade Development Council will set up an office in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to promote business ties between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that he and Cambodian officials have discussed easing visa and travel rules to promote tourism in both places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also thanked Cambodia for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

    New taxi fleets to hit the streets within a year

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1764032_1_20240731131941.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five new taxi fleets are expected to hit the streets within a year after beating several other applicants to win licences.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities on Wednesday said they received 15 applications in total, but three did not meet the requirements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the chosen fleets, three will operate only urban taxis, while the other two will cover urban areas as well as the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms have a year to complete their preparations and will operate a total of 3,500 cabs, accounting for a fifth of the taxis in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport Commissioner Angela Lee said fleet operators will provide training for drivers and monitor their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said they have to offer a number of electronic payment methods as well as online car-hailing services with no cap on booking fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individual applicants may engage different partners for developing the online platform for them. There will be quite a room for development, taking into account their own market strategies and the clientele they are targeting. We do not stipulate the hard-and-fast rule on how the online services will have to be done," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For trips booked in advance, we will allow the flexibility for the taxi drivers to charge at a pre-agreed rate, or to charge according to the meter, plus an additional amount as the pre-booking fees."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers will be able to rate their taxi drivers with a complaint mechanism in place, the transport official said, adding that serious breaches could result in the termination of licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said car parks in Tsing Yi and Tai Po are in the pipeline for the taxis, and the authorities will look into whether to expand the scheme to grant more licences in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the fleet operators, Sino Development, said it will operate taxis across the city, including on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to make good use of our resources and operate all 1,000 taxis to provide quality services to citizens," said fleet operations manager Wong Tai-hoi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For full-time cabbies, we will need 2,000 of them, on top of 1,000 part-time, substitute drivers."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung from another operator, Big Boss Taxi Company, said the group already has a number of taxis in line with the requirement that vehicles in the fleets must not be more than three years old.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Coming from the taxi industry, we already have on hand almost 200 taxis. They are ready to be deployed anytime. But we do want to have a more diverse fleet, which includes the premium taxis as well as the ones for wheelchairs," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Likely we will do a soft launch at the end of this year, maybe perhaps early next year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fleet operator SynCab Service, for its part, said it will bring in over 120 new cabs before the end of the year, including six-seater, electric taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said reserving a journey in a six-seater is expected to cost 10 to 25 percent more than a taxi meter charge.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Foreign business leaders on Wednesday said a new permit is providing easier access to the mainland, as the first batch of non-Chinese permanent residents in Hong Kong received their travel cards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Permit holders can travel to the mainland within the five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce, Dato' Gan Khai Choon, was among those collecting their permits at a China Travel Service centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we wanted to go to mainland China, in the early days, we had to apply for a visa like everybody else. But for Malaysians ourselves, we also needed to apply for permission from our Malaysian government to have a permit to go into China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When China and Malaysia had a better relationship, we could apply independently without the Malaysian approval. But even at that time, to apply for a visa, it was quite difficult because the process and passport requirements were quite cumbersome."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the application process for the new permit was smooth with the application centre offering him a "first-class service", and that he's planning to travel to the mainland in the coming few weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A former committee member of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, Alfred Buchner, received his permit after filing an application around three weeks ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hasn't travelled to the mainland for seven years, because he wanted to avoid the hassle of going through the visa application process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There are a lot of suppliers which I see in China, where I have contact in China, so far only by email... With this travel permit, it's a big encouragement to visit China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Buchner, who picked up his permit along with his family, said he would first travel to Shenzhen for a weekend trip.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says the city does not have sufficient sports venues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Institute (HKSI), Vincent Cheng, on Wednesday called on the government to provide more details about proposed new sports facilities, saying Hong Kong currently needs more venues.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK radio programme, Cheng noted that proposals for new sports facilities, such as a fencing area and swimming pools, were put forward in the past two chief executive policy addresses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I don't see the government earmarking any land or a firm timetable for when construction will be completed. It takes time to build such facilities and I hope the authorities will announce a timetable as soon as possible," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng, who's also a DAB lawmaker, said new HKSI facilities will be completed by the end of the year, but they will not provide a significant increase in space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China Table Tennis Association coach Yeung Ping-chiu echoed Cheng's remarks, saying a lack of facilities poses a major challenge for various sports.

    Wong Ka-lee tells judokas Olympics not a pipe dream

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Wong Ka-lee says she wants to show young judokas that it's possible to reach the Olympics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Olympian Wong Ka-lee said she hopes her journey to Paris will inspire other young judokas to pursue their dreams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wong, 26, was the third judoka ever from Hong Kong to qualify for the Olympics, marking the return of a local judoka to the Games after 12 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was eliminated in the women’s under 48kg competition by Austrian Katharina Tanzer, who is 17 places higher than her in the world rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Wong believes her presence in the Olympics would show others that they too can make it to the world stage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Younger [athletes] may think the Olympics are out of reach. But going to the Olympics this time can show them that it’s not. They can all do it,” she told RTHK in an exclusive interview.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete said her judo journey is far from over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Olympics are a good experience. I see that I have obviously improved this year in terms of throwing techniques. I hope I can perform better in the next competition,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first-time Olympian said she will stay in Paris to watch the matches of top judokas and visit wineries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said she will continue to sharpen her skills, and her next goal is the Asian Judo Open Hong Kong which starts in November.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China badminton star Lee Cheuk-yiu made a winning start in his maiden Olympic appearance, beating Mexico's Luis Ramon Garrido in the group stage of the men's singles tournament.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee, the world number 17 who missed out on a spot for the Tokyo Games in 2021, overpowered his opponent 21-5 in the first game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 66th-ranked Garrido, who was also making his Olympic debut in Paris, took the ensuing game 21-15 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair exchanged leads in a nail-biting finale, but Lee eventually came out on top after pulling away late on to win 21-17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top men's shuttler from the SAR next faces Chou Tien-chien of Chinese Taipei Wednesday evening, Hong Kong time. The winner of that match will advance to the round of 16, as Chou had already beaten Garrido earlier in their group tie.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's a different story for another local badminton player, Happy Lo, who ended her Olympic journey after losing her second straight group match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Supanida Katethong of Thailand beat Lo 21-14, 21-9.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Edgar Cheung's win over Fillippo Macchi has sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian fans. Photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763930_1_20240730221521.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee (SF&OC) of Hong Kong, China said it respects the decision of the referees in a controversy involving fencer Edgar Cheung's win over his Italian opponent in the individual foil final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “The Olympic Games are the highest-level events in the world. As always, the SF&OC and athletes adhere to and firmly believe in the Olympic spirit, respecting all game results and referee decisions,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Italian Fencing Federation earlier lodged a complaint against what it called “unacceptable refereeing decisions” in Cheung's 15-14 win over Fillippo Macchi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  President of the federation, Paolo Azzi, said he was disappointed with the conclusion the match, adding that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been robbed of the gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There were two occasions where both fencers landed their touches, but the referees from Chinese Taipei and South Korea ruled that no point should be awarded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Macchi wrote in his Instagram post that he didn’t want to blame the referees for his defeat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that for sure the refereeing could have been better. It's impossible to not call three touches but at the end of the day that's the nature of the competition," Nicola Lu, epee coach of SAR fencer Cedric Ho, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have external factors that we cannot control and we can only focus on doing our best and focusing on our own actions,” Lu added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case also sparked a war of words between Hong Kong and Italian netizens on the social media platforms of the two fencers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The head fencing coach of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Zheng Zhaokang, felt it was unlikely that Cheung will be stripped of his gold due to Italy's appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don’t think it will affect [the result] because the referees were very careful. They made the judgement after watching video replays many times. Even when you ask [other] people to review the play, it will still be the same result," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that the referees must decide responsibly when it’s hard to tell who wins or loses, adding that it’s normal for people to have different interpretations.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting fought hard in the bronze-medal match of the mixed doubles table tennis event at the Paris Olympics, but they weren’t able to make it to the podium.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team on Tuesday lost 0-4 to South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon in a match lasting 39 minutes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The South Korean pair were off to a quick start, winning the first game 11-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then raced to a 3-0 lead, taking the second and third games 11-7, 11-7.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong pushed hard to catch up in a nail-biting fourth game, but it eventually went to Shin and Lim, 14-12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we missed the medal by a small margin, the fact that we got into the top four this time is already a big breakthrough," Doo said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because actually there were a lot of teams before whose ability were better or similar to ours. Including the semi-finals, we really did keep trying to become better. Even though the ending was not the best, we did try our best."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the defeat, it's the best finish for Hong Kong in mixed doubles table tennis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously it's a bit of a pity, especially since we had a chance to get a medal both today and yesterday," Wong said. "Although we are not very satisfied with our performance today, we were already thinking hard and communicating with each other about any strategy we can have before the match."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Swimmer Ian Ho has been eliminated from the men’s 100m freestyle event on Tuesday at the Olympic Games, finishing 55th overall.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete, who is competing for the second time at the Games, finished sixth in his heat with a time of 51.46 seconds, 2.62 seconds behind the heat 5 winner Lamar Taylor of the Bahamas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's definitely a different experience, but it's a little more familiar, so I'm glad I can be here again,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself. Swimming is a sport where you can focus on yourself and do the best race that you can, and that's what I've tried to do over the past couple of days."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jack Alexy of the United States led all 79 swimmers with a time of 47.57 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only the 16 fastest from the heats qualify for the semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho will also compete in the men’s 50m freestyle in Paris.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have failed to advance in the women's doubles in badminton at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In their final group match on Tuesday, the SAR duo lost to Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first game was a closely fought affair before the No 4 seed from China prevailed, 21-18.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second game was also close with the score tied several times early on, before Liu and Tan put on a late charge to come away 21-15 winners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did well because we didn't fear them for their ranking. Even when we were trailing by many points during the match, we absolutely didn't give up and we tried to fight point by point," Lianne Yeung said afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair finished in third place in Group B with one win and two losses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China topped the group and Bulgaria came second, both advancing to the next round.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun's hopes of capturing a medal at the Paris Olympics came to an end on Tuesday, after he finished last among six competitors in the first quarter-final of the men's rowing single sculls event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 29-year-old clocked in a time of seven minutes 13.7 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I knew I was competing against seeded players in the quarter-finals, so I tried to catch up with them in the first 500 metres," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it would be challenging, but I didn't want to give up. The process was difficult and I had only myself, from preparing for the match to drawing up a race plan."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will row again in the C and D semi-finals on Wednesday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese diplomat in Cambodia has hailed a visit by a Hong Kong delegation to the Southeast Asian country as a boost to bilateral cooperation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wang Wenbin, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, on Tuesday met Chief Executive John Lee, who arrived in the capital Phnom Penh as part of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Laos and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the meeting, Wang noted that he had earlier sent off another delegation led by former chief executive and vice-chairman of the nation's top political advisory body, CY Leung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With Lee and Leung visiting at the same time, this shows that Hong Kong attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperation with Cambodia and promoting China-Cambodia relations," Wang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The chief executive's visit will certainly promote mutually beneficial cooperation between Cambodia and Hong Kong, and play a role in further boosting China-Cambodia relations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE, for his part, stressed the importance of fostering ties between governments, and allowing companies to do business.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of his departure to Cambodia from Laos, Lee congratulated and praised fencer Edgar Cheung and swimmer Siobhan Haughey for their outstanding performances at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said their performances showed the excellence of Hong Kong's athletes, while reiterating the government's commitment to sports development.

  Commissioner Cui Jianchun on Tuesday said sanctions imposed by the West on the territory disrespect the city's authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we want to build a good, sound relationship, we have to respect each other. That means every country has to respect the Hong Kong SAR government. And whatever things happen, you cannot use your national law to become a long-arm jurisdiction to impose sanctions to other nations, to other individual companies," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said none of the consuls-general he's met in Hong Kong were against the city having its national security laws, and that a majority of them supported the legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commissioner also urged foreign governments to support Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui said he hopes he could work with the SAR administration during his tenure on the accession bid, as the move would be conducive to the city's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the recent visit to China by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, where he discussed the war with Russia with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and met Chief Executive John Lee in Hong Kong, the commissioner said the SAR government is sticking to international law and international norms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong SAR government, Hong Kong people love to support the peaceful dialogue, peaceful communication as quickly as possible... and to relieve, also to alleviate, to reduce the suffering of the people and to try to do good things for the international community," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cui, a former ambassador, was appointed to the office in April this year, filling the post after his predecessor Liu Guangyuan was named a deputy director of the liaison office.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong Tramways is celebrating its 120th anniversary, saying it aims to continue to contribute to the public transport system, attract more tourists and remain meaningful to locals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The trams transport around 150,000 passengers daily, representing over 10 percent of the Hong Kong Island population and making it one of the busiest tram networks in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managing Director of Hong Kong Tramways Paul Tirvaudey on Tuesday said the company seeks to balance modernisation of the system with preserving its identity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our point is not to insert a modern tram... it is to insert modern components into the tram to keep the appearance while making a more modern system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said passenger numbers are gradually recovering post-Covid, but they are still down 10-15 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a celebration ceremony, Tirvaudey emphasised the firm's commitment to sustainability, saying it is building trams that are 30 percent more energy efficient, reusing old parts for new trams to create a circular economy, and conducting carbon footprint assessments to identify areas for improvement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are green. We are among the best in the class, but we work to be even better in the future," he said.

    'Kids inspired by Haughey struggle to get in the pool'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey's success in the water has inspired many of the SAR's young people to take up the sport, but there simply aren't enough public pools to go around, according to one expert.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Swimming Teachers' Association, Li Chi-leung, told an RTHK programme on Tuesday that a lack of swimming pools means many grassroots children are unable to participate in the sport because it's out of their families' financial reach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Parents want their children to learn look for swimming classes in the community, most of which are set up by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. But the department doesn't offer many classes, and during the winter there are very few classes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they sign up for private classes, it's very expensive to book a pool and private classes do have to make a profit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the government should build more indoor pools and keep them open all year round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey won bronze in the women's 200m freestyle final in Paris, becoming the first Hong Kong athlete to win three Olympic medals following her two at the Tokyo Games.

    Edgar Cheung defends Olympic fencing gold in foil

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's fencing king Edgar Cheung defended his Olympic gold medal in men's foil in dramatic fashion after making a brilliant comeback in the final match against Italian Filippo Macchi in the early hours of Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Italian pulled ahead 14-12, but Cheung immediately gained two points to bring the game into a tie-breaker for the gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the score tied at 14-14, the fencing got even more intense.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On two occasions, both fencers thought they had won the last point, but the judges said it was too close to rule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After three attempts to break the tie, Cheung took home the win for Hong Kong, China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he couldn't believe he's the first athlete to repeat in men's foil in 68 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I still can't believe [that I've won]...and being the first man to repeat in so long, actually, I really rather can't believe it," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's one of the best moments in my life. To have a gold medal in France, with a French coach, for me it's a wonderful day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he woke up not feeling too good, but when he fenced, it was different.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said coach Greg Koenig told him not to focus on the judges' decisions late in the game, and focus on the next move.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The coach, for his part, said he never doubted that Cheung could overcome his deficit at 12-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The three last points, to be honest, I know he can do it. I will stay positive. I will send him my maximum positive energy because I know, three points in a row for him is absolutely nothing," Koenig said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The victory helped him claim his second gold in as many Games and becomes the first athlete from the SAR to grab consecutive Olympic titles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong now has two gold medals in Paris, both in fencing, the most ever won at a single Games so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the match, the Italian Fencing Federation has lodged an official complaint with the International Fencing Federation and the International Olympic Committee over what it considers to be unacceptable refereeing decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation President Paolo Azzi expressed his disappointment at the conclusion of the competition, claiming that Macchi was the rightful winner and had been unfairly denied the gold medal he deserved.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Siobhan Haughey won a consecutive medal in the women's 200m freestyle, earning bronze on top of the silver she won in Tokyo.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong star was among the first to turn at the half-way point before her Australian rivals Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus turned up the heat in the second 100 metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  O'Callaghan pulled away from Titmus and Haughey in the last lap to win in an Olympic record time of 1 minute, 53.27 seconds, 0.54 seconds ahead of defending champion Titmus who settled for silver while Haughey picked up the bronze in a time of 1 minute, 54.55.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey said after the race that her time wasn't as good as she thought it would be, but she's still satisfied with the result, saying the Australian swimmers were really strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said it was a special moment for her because when she won silvers in Tokyo, there were no spectators because of Covid, and she's glad that her parents were among many in the crowd cheering her on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The star swimmer also thanked Hongkongers for staying up to support her and other SAR athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thank you so much for everyone who's been waking up really early to watch our races, our matches and competitions," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I haven't really been on social media a lot these past few days, but I've received everyone's messages and all the love and support, so, thank you so much and please keep supporting us because it means the world to us."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is Haughey's third Olympic medal following the two silvers she won in the 100m and 200m freestyle events at the Tokyo Games three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is due to compete in the women's 100m free on Tuesday.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung is through to the final of the men's individual foil after beating his Japanese opponent in the semis.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung prevailed against Kazuki Iimura 15-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Both fencers started the match with quick points, as they went neck to neck in a gripping semi-final match. Cheung was able to widen the gap and ultimately take the win with seconds still remaining in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Coach Gregory Koenig said they are here for the gold once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “He really could control his emotions. He showed real maturity in his fencing. Whatever the score was, he was really focused so it was amazing,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still have one more match. We came here for the gold and we will give the maximum for the gold.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This will be the second fencing medal for Hong Kong, China, given Cheung is guaranteed at least a silver.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also means Cheung becomes the first Hong Kong athlete to have a chance at defending their Olympic title.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If he wins, Cheung would be the first man to defend an Olympic foil title since 1956.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He will face Italian Filippo Macchi in the final at 4.10am Hong Kong time.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s windsurfers were finally able to make some waves in the south of France, with Mui Ma ranking fourth after finishing her first day of Olympic races.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ma finished sixth and fifth in her two races respectively. There are five races in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her fellow windsurfer Alex Cheng ranked 20th after his first race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s skiff sailors, Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth, remained in second to last place after completing half of their races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The windsurfing competitions were postponed for a day due to a lack of wind down in Marseilles.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis stars Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting will play for a mixed doubles bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, after losing to North Korea's pair 3-4 in the semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was an up and down match, with Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong, the lowest seed in this tournament, starting with a bang and taking the first game 3-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo and Wong then took the second game 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth-seeded Hong Kong pair then had a 2-1 edge after winning the third game 11-3. But they dropped the next two, 9-11, 9-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With their backs against the wall at the South Paris Arena, Doo and Wong went on to win the sixth game 11-9 to force a decider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's when the North Koreans went on the attack, as they jumped out to a 7-0 lead behind Ri's strong forehand smashes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair fought their way back to make it 6-9, before eventually dropping the final game 6-11.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Korean giant killers had started the tournament defeating the world number two pair, Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan, in the first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR duo will face South Korea's Shin Yu-bin and Lim Jong-hoon, who lost to China's top-seeded Sun Yingsha and Wang Chuqin in the other semi-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking after the match, Wong said they gave it their all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Facing these North Koreans, they're the so-called dark horses. But any team in the final four has to be very good. So actually, when we faced them, we felt we were the dark horses," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So on the table, we fought until the very end, but we failed. We will collect ourselves for the bronze medal match and hopefully we can win a medal for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bronze medal match will take place on Tuesday at 7:30pm Hong Kong time.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The governing council of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) on Monday expressed disappointment over what it described as  “misjudgments" by management in bypassing the council when it changed the university's emblem two years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  After a council meeting to discuss the logo change, chairman John Chai said the whole project cost around HK$4 million, most of which was spent on hiring international branding consultants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The decision to change the emblem to mark the university’s 60th anniversary in October 2022 drew criticism from students and alumni who were not consulted. The new logo was later shelved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The university council will learn from experience and take appropriate measures to improve university governance and try to avoid a repeat of a similar incident,” Chai told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chai added that the university president Rocky Tuan – who announced in January that he was resigning – should take full responsibility for the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Tuan was unable to attend Monday's council meeting due to a work trip. Tuan will leave his post in January next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Defending Olympic champion Edgar Cheung overcame a partisan home crowd to edge out Enzo Lefort of France for a place in the semi-finals of the men’s individual foil on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lefort took control in the opening stages, with Cheung ending the first round down 3-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR athlete was able to turn it around early in the second round, but the French fencer fought back, leading to a nail-biting back and forth that ended with the second round score at 13-14.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung, knowing he would go out if he lost another point, scored two quick points in an intense final round to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, taking Hong Kong, China into the final four.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When you fence against a guy who is a two-time world champion, who is playing in his hometown with all the public, of course it’s going to be hard, harder than usual but Ka-long found the psychological resources to put the last point, which is amazing regarding to the match, so I am very, very again proud of what he did,” said coach Gregory Koenig.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “You have to understand that even when you are tired, you have enough adrenaline to find the resources. You are tired but the psychological is the most important at this point. Even when you have pain everywhere, you have to think ‘OK I have pain, but this is life, this is how it is, I have to do what I know what to do’ and that is what he did in the last two points. The last two points were amazing.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Koenig added that his next opponent Kazuki Iimura of Japan would definitely be a challenge, saying the Japanese fencer might be shorter than Cheung, but he moves very quickly.

 The American restaurant chain Outback Steakhouse announced it will shut down nine of its 19 outlets in Hong Kong. About 300 staff are expected to lose their jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Outback said the affected eateries are located in Causeway Bay, Central, Mong Kok and other areas.

  <br/>
  They will stay open until Sunday.

  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, the chain described it as a difficult business decision.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Laos signed 12 MOUs to boost cooperation during Chief Executive John Lee's visit to the Asean member state.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing in the capital Vientiane on Monday evening as he wrapped his visit to Laos, he said there's room for the two sides to further enhance ties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our two-day visit in Laos is fruitful. We have a total of 12 MOUs being exchanged, from trade and economic partnership, investment promotion, Customs collaboration, education exchange, logistics cooperation, to financial services and air services development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking ahead, I believe Hong Kong and Laos will have huge potentials and opportunities for cooperation, and there's ample room to grow in terms of trade and people-to-people exchange."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Hong Kong is an ideal platform for Laotian companies to tap into the Greater Bay Area market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that more cooperation between both the business sector between the two places and people-to-people exchange will help produce good benefits to the two peoples," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the visit, he met with the leaders of Laos and visited places such as Vientiane Secondary School where students have been learning Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech at the school, he said Polytechnic University has signed an MOU with the school, offering scholarships to high-achieving students so that they can study at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also pointed out Hong Kong recently relaxed the visa policy for Laotian talent to work or study in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee will head to Cambodia on Tuesday on the next leg of his three-nation visit which also includes Vietnam.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers on Monday flocked to shopping malls and government facilities to watch Olympic gold medallist Edgar Cheung and other SAR athletes in action.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Scores of people were at a shopping mall in Kwun Tong to watch the live-stream of the Games on a giant screen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the spectators was Valerie, who was there with her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's really exciting, because there are people cheering when the athletes won or scored a point. I think this is really different (from) watching at home," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another spectator, Ena, said she was there to cheer on all the Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In general, their performance has been really motivational to all the Hong Kong citizens. Just wonderful to see more Hong Kong people step into the Olympics, like be the Olympians, and participate in such a big event," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thomas, who was watching Cheung's bouts, said he was moved by the perseverance of the home-grown athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think they are so hardworking. They put a lot of efforts on it. We should really support them," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung and star swimmer Siobhan Haughey are among those in action on day three of the Paris Games.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Olympic champion Edgar Cheung on Monday easily booked his spot in the last 16 of men’s foil individual event at the Grand Palais in Paris.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer beat Daniel Gu of Canada 15-5 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung went ahead by seven points before his Canadian opponent started striking back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he could not narrow the deficit and Cheung went on to win in the opening three-minute period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This was the plan. We knew this opponent is a strong opponent but I knew if Cheung Ka-long is at his level, he can defeat easily and this was the plan,” said Cheung's coach Gregory Koenig after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung will take on China's Mo Zewei next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I really wanted Ka-long to keep focus, to stay focus on every point even if the score was very high difference, to keep focusing, to keep fighting to be fully prepared for the next match, which is going to be to very tough against Mo Ziwei,” Koenig added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Gu said he treasured the opportunity to take on an Olympic champion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There is no point being mad or upset about it. I already knew going into this, I am not a favourite to win, so I just wanted to experience what it’s like to get beat by someone that good,” said Gu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It was fun. It is always a learning experience so all the hits and points he gets on me, there is a reason why he is an Olympic champion.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two SAR table tennis players, Wong Chun-ting and Zhu Chengzhu, on Monday won their singles matches at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the men's draw, Wong beat Ibrahima Diaw of Senegal in a nail-biter in a round of 64 match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair split the first six games, including a marathon second game lasting 14 minutes in favour of Wong, 18-16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong prevailed in the seventh and deciding game, 11-4, to make it through to the next round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall, I feel satisfied with my performance today," he said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I knew it was tough, but there were also some surprises... My opponent was in form quickly and acted more decisively, creating a lot of big difficulties for me. So it’s a good thing that I quickly adjusted my game, and luckily I won the second game."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By contrast, Zhu's victory in her round of 64 match was a more straight-forward affair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She swept Chien Tung-chuan of Chinese Taipei 11-7, 11-7, 11-7, 12-10.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Cindy Cheung was on Monday eliminated in the first round of women’s 100m backstroke in the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  She finished fifth in her heat at the Paris La Defense Arena in 1 min 3.45 secs, which put her 29th among 36 contestants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fastest 16 swimmers qualify for the semifinals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katharine Berkoff and Regan Smith from the United States and Australian Kaylee McKeown are in the top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even though the time isn't the most satisfactory, I will still say it's a great opportunity, and I'm just grateful that I get to finally say that I've competed in the Olympics," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of performance, and may be like handling the nerves, I think there's still much to improve on, that I can learn from other more experienced swimmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yeah, I'm just here as a learning experience and to enjoy my time here."

 The Customs and Excise Department on Monday said its computer forensic lab is looking into the use of artificial intelligence to enhance efficiency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Senior Inspector Wong Wai-kei said the lab handles over 100 cases every year, noting a rise in complexity and case volume owing to big data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that customs are working to boost the accuracy of its technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The accuracy of our system is around 80 percent. This 80 percent figure is based on our previous training data. This accuracy can be influenced by various factors, such as data volume or complexity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, our technical personnel are currently fine-tuning this system. We hope to improve our data model and increase accuracy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the technology would help with the analysis of digital evidence, such as text, images, and videos.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Industry representatives on Monday expressed mixed feelings about business sentiment during the Olympics, despite seeing a boost in foot traffic.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Allan Zeman, chairman of the Lan Kwai Fong Group, told RTHK that he expects bar takings to surge as much as 10 percent during the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said people might feel in the mood to spend after fencer Vivian Kong won a gold medal, but their elation wouldn't last long.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If they're happier, then they will be in a better mood to either buy retail or if they're in a bar with friends watching the Olympics, normally it's conducive to spending some money. I'd say if anything, it'll be maybe a 10 percent [sales increase] at best, but it's not going to be a huge game changer,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zeman said he doesn't believe the Games will persuade people to keep spending more in the long-run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Unfortunately, once the Games finish, then I think people will go back to normal,” he said, adding that the key to bringing back a “vibrant nightlife scene in the city” relies on hosting more international events to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Fung Wing-yan from Sun Hung Kai Properties’ leasing department said the apm mall in Kwun Tong, which is showing the Games, saw an increase in foot traffic of at least 10 percent over Saturday and Sunday, compared to the previous weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fund told an RTHK programme that she believes the public became more engaged with the Olympics from the Tokyo Games, when they enjoyed watching the events together in malls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that he saw a surge in customers at restaurants with televisions on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects a 15 to 20 percent overall increase in business during the Olympics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Monday said his administration has been focusing its attention on economic development and that business is a "win-win" situation for all, as he met with Lao officials as part of his third trip to Asean countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee is leading a delegation to Laos, the first stop of a six-day visit to three nations that also includes Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee met Laos' deputy prime minister and foreign minister Saleumxay Kommasith, witnessing the signing of a number of memoranda of understanding between the two places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that business is always a win-win situation for the people of both places, and I have been focusing the whole government and society's energy and attention on strengthening economic development and business," Lee said during the meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The purpose of my visit to Laos on this occasion is, first of all, to strengthen ties between government and government, and of course, strengthen ties between business and business, and also very importantly, strengthen ties between people and people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith, for his part, pointed to a new action plan signed by President Xi Jinping and General-Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Thongloun Sisoulith last year, saying it will be a solid foundation for bilateral cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kommasith also said the country is committed to working with the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a good opportunity for me and the [Lao People's Democratic Republic], both the government as well as the business community, to discuss and find a way to further expand economic trade cooperation in the [Lao People's Democratic Republic] and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also met Laotian Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, who welcomed the SAR delegation and called the visit a milestone on economic, cultural, trade and investment cooperation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On social media, the chief executive thanked Laos for supporting Hong Kong's bid for accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that the volume of trade and investment flows between Laos and Hong Kong have ample room to grow. We see much prospect for deeper collaboration of our economic relations as both economies place importance to the developments of green economy and digital economy," Lee wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three women and two men have been arrested over the suspected murder of a 33-year-old man in Jordan, police said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The man was found unconscious on Pilkem Street on Sunday morning and was later declared dead after being taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they think the alleged attack, which happened after the man left a suspected illegal gambling den at around 2am, could have been linked to a personal dispute.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Assistant District Commander Ching Chi-yan said the force suspects the victim was struck multiple times about the head with a hammer, adding that cracks were found in the back of the man's skull.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man, 40, and a woman, 32, were arrested on suspicion of murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other women and a man, aged between 34 and 56, were suspected of assisting an offender.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five were being held in detention as police continued their investigation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong fencer Vivian Kong will inspire young people to follow their dreams and take up sport as a career, according to Education University physical education lecturer Lobo Louie.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Kong, 30, took Hong Kong's third ever Olympics gold when she won the individual women's épée in Paris at the weekend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the world number one is helping to promote sports development by raising the profile and popularity of fencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think fencing as an Olympic sport has to get established among young people... It (Kong's victory) can encourage more people, especially young people, to engage in physical activity and eventually to improve their overall physical and mental health as well," he said on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kong pulled out of the Asian Championships quarter-finals last month due to a knee injury, and underwent surgery for torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) in 2017 and 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Louie said the fencer was lucky to be able to return to elite level after the injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The sports medicine and literature indicates that maybe around 60 to 70 percent of the athletes can return to elite level," he said, adding that full credit for her recovery must go to her medical team for their "very good strategic rehabilitation plan".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some elite players, or maybe like soccer players, if you have an ACL injury, you may end your football career," Louie noted.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong swimmer Siobhan Haughey made it to the women’s 200m freestyle final at the Paris Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In the first 100 metres, Haughey maintained a steady top three.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was able to narrow the gap and finished third in the second semi-final of the event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her time of 1 minute, 55.51 seconds was the fourth fastest overall, earning her one of eight spots in the final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final will take place in the early hours of Tuesday, Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey’s main rivals are Australians Mollie O'Callaghan, who won gold in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, and Ariarne Titmus, who holds the world and Olympic records in the event and defended her title in the 400m free on the first day of the Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Haughey took silver in the 100m and 200m free at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago and won the world title in the 200 freestyle earlier this year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's badminton pair of Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam have staved off elimination from the Paris Olympics, after beating their American counterparts in a grueling match in the early hours of Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR shuttlers recovered a day after losing their opener against a pair from Bulgaria, to beat US twins Kerry and Annie Xu 2-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After trailing by eight points at one point, the SAR duo went on a 12-4 run to close the first game 24-22, saving four game points in the process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Xus fought one back, 21-17, taking advantage of the Hong Kong pair's mistakes in quick succession towards the end of the second game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As fatigue appeared to affect the Americans more, the Hong Kong shuttlers won the decider, 21-11, for their first point of the tournament.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Yeungs will battle Team China's Liu Shengshu and Tan Ning on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If the SAR loses, the pair will need the Americans to beat the Bulgarian sisters, Gabriela and Stefani Stoeva, by a wide margin for them to have a chance to advance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's table tennis pair of Doo Hoi-kem and Wong Chun-ting are one win away from a medal at the Paris Olympics, after advancing to the mixed doubles semi-finals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They defeated Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao of Spain 4-2 in the quarter-finals on Sunday at the South Paris Arena.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR pair dropped the first game 9-11, but they won the next two games 11-9 and 11-4.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fourth game saw a suspenseful back and forth with the Spanish team securing that game 12-10, but Doo and Wong fought back in the next game winning 11-2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong, China team ultimately took the win 11-8 in the last game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching the final four is Hong Kong's best result in this event and Wong said they were glad to have made the breakthrough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe I'm just excited like everyone else is. Because at the previous games we went out in the last eight, and now we've made a breakthrough to enter the semifinals," he told reporters post-game.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very difficult match. We've lost to them before. This time we gained our revenge. Ah Doo performed very well on the table. I trusted her 120 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For Doo, it was the perfect tonic after losing her first-round singles match earlier in the day to North Korea's Pyon Song-gyong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doo will square off against the North Korean team again in the semis on Monday when she and Wong face Ri Jong-sik and Kim Kum-yong at 10pm Hong Kong time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The North Koreans had defeated the world number two pair of Hina Hayata and Tomokazu Harimoto of Japan in an earlier round.

 Hong Kong skiff sailors found themselves in second to last place after completing the first day of their Paris Olympics races on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR's Akira Sakai and Russell Aylsworth ranked 19th out of 20 teams in the event after three races in Marseille.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They started off with 17 points in the first race, and improved to 12 points in the second. The final event of the day didn't turn out as well, as the pair finished with 19 points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sailors with the fewest points win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Team China's pair of Wen Zaiding and Liu Tian are tenth after race day one, while New Zealanders Isaac McHardie and William McKenzie have taken the top spot so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The medal rounds are due to take place on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the windsurfing competitions were postponed for the day due to a lack of wind. Hong Kong's Alex Cheng and Mui Ma are in the men's and women's events, respectively.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The maiden Olympic journeys of two SAR fencers, Daphne Chan and Cedric Ho, came to an end on Sunday, but both earned praise from their coaches for their strong performances.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nineteen-year-old Chan bowed out of the women's foil individual event after she was beaten 15-8 by Germany’s Anne Sauer in the round of 16 at the Grand Palais in Paris. It's still the best result ever in the event for a Hong Kong competitor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sauer seized a 5-4 advantage after a back-and-forth first round.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The world No 6 from Germany continued to impress in the second round, extending the lead to 10-5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was too big a deficit for Chan, ranked 31st in the world, to overcome, but she said after the match that making it this far is already a huge accomplishment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy I could reach top 16 and I think I enjoyed the stage so much, the atmosphere was amazing, and I'm very happy that I completed my first Olympics in a really good way," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Her coach Gregory Koenig applauded the teenage fencer for her performance, adding that Chan has the capability to compete at the highest level.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know people can be disappointed because she doesn't bring a medal to Hong Kong. But we have to be honest, she fenced very well. She showed us she has the ability to have an amazing mindset for this kind of event, at 19 years old, her first Olympic Games," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Psychologically, she can be a great champion. Now she still has to work on the technical skills, the tactical skills, all the physical part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When all these are perfectly set out, if she can keep this mindset, she can really be in the top of the world and bring a medal in the next Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan had edged out Sera Azuma of Japan 15-14 in the round of 32.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another Hong Kong Olympic debutant, Cedric Ho, lost to Masaru Yamada of Japan 15-9 in the men's épée.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho was off to a quick start in their round of 32 match, racing to a 5-2 lead at the end of the first period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yamada rallied in the next period, tying the score at 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR fencer faltered in the third and final period which his Japanese opponent won 7-1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all the times I have competed against him, I have never had a lead of more than five points. After the draw, I knew he was difficult to beat, but I wanted to try my best," Ho said after the match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had a big lead before I was overtaken, which I regret."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His coach, Nicola Lu, said Ho gave an exceptional performance despite the loss.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think that he was himself. That's the most important thing," he said. "The only regret is he didn't believe enough. My old coach used to say these are the moments you are more afraid of winning than losing."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem was on Sunday eliminated in the first round of the women's singles at the Paris Olympics, losing 4-1 to North Korea's Pyon Song Gyong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The three-time SAR Olympian started off the round of 64 match losing two straight games 8-11 and 7-11, before fighting back and winning the third 12-10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the North Korean won two more games 11-7 and 11-4 and sent Doo packing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 27-year-old Doo, who won bronze as part of the SAR's women's team at the Tokyo Games, will play in the mixed doubles quarter-finals with teammate Wong Chun-ting later on Sunday. They will take on the Spanish duo of Alvaro Robles and Maria Xiao for a spot in the semi-finals.

    Crowds at Prince Edward amid partial MTR suspension

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR says there were larger-than-normal crowds at Prince Edward station. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1763535_1_20240728165335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR said there were larger crowds on Sunday at Prince Edward station than normal because of a partial suspension of services, but made it clear crowd-control measures were in place to facilitate travel.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The rail company suspended services between Prince Edward and Ho Man Tin on the Kwun Tong Line to carry out large-scale tunnel asset renewal work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four affected stations – Prince Edward, Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei and Ho Man Tin – are still being served by either the Tsuen Wan Line or the Tuen Ma Line, while Prince Edward is the only interchange station between the Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at Yau Ma Tei station, Cheris Lee, the MTR's chief of operating and metro segment, says staff have been told to be proactive in assisting passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said she believed the impact of suspension will be minimised, with the maintenance work being carried out on a Sunday during the summer vacation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Passengers can still use our alternative routes to all stations today," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR deployed more than 1,000 staff to facilitate operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement later in the day, the firm described the overall situation on Sunday as smooth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One passenger, surnamed Wong, said the suspension should have happened on a weekday, given the number of mainland tourists and foreign domestic helpers who were off on Sunday. "At least during the weekdays, there will be fewer people, at least fewer mainlanders... this (the suspension along with the rain) would create a more negative impact to Hong Kong's image," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR also reminded passengers who are travelling to Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau on the East Rail Line to be 20 to 30 minutes early, to ensure they'll catch the last train.

 Hong Kong rower Chiu Hin-chun on Sunday advanced to the quarterfinals of the men's single sculls at the Paris Olympics after finishing second in his repechage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chiu finished two seconds behind Sid Ali Boudina of Algeria, clocking 7 minutes and 12.94 seconds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR rower was in second place through the first 500 metres, but dropped to third for the next kilometre. He picked up the pace in the final stretch and overtook Bermuda's Dara Alizadeh for second place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have earned the respect of many competitors, because they thought Hong Kong's rowing team might not be able to perform well and be competitive in open events. But I showed them that I was capable to reach the quarterfinals," Chiu said after the race.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had finished out of the running in Saturday's heat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The quarterfinals are set to be held on Tuesday.

 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Sunday said Hong Kong will be exploring business opportunities in emerging economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) bloc.

  His comments came as Chief Executive John Lee embarked on a visit to the Asean member states of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme, Yau said Hong Kong can offer professional services to these countries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can bring in a lot of professional services to these countries, to help their economic development. These countries have a very strong relationship with China. With this relationship, I think there are a lot of opportunities there."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the government may set up more Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) in Asean countries, in addition to the existing ones in Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Sunday began a six-day trip to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam to further explore business opportunities there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Laos, Lee said he will persuade the three Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries to back Hong Kong's inclusion in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will meet with local leaders to introduce Hong Kong's economic development and opportunities, and I will continue to seek their support for us to join the RCEP," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Second, we will promote economic and trade exchanges in different regions. We will present Hong Kong's role as a super-connector and a 'super value-adder,' showcasing what we can offer such as professional services, our experience, our connections, and how we can guide them to benefit from opportunities in Hong Kong and also enter the mainland market and more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted that the combined population of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam totals around 120 million, describing them as a huge market and business prospect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's delegation includes some 30 leaders from various business and technology sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said the upcoming economic figures indicate sustained growth in Hong Kong's economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a blog post, Chan said the government will this week unveil GDP figures for the second quarter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that both exports and investments have shown continual growth, attributed to an uptick in external demand and a surge in the nation's overall exports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the finance minister expressed optimism that challenges from geopolitics will likely diminish, which will benefit investment and asset markets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the stable growth of the mainland economy will provide significant support to Hong Kong's economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also hoped that a series of exhibitions and large-scale events will bring in more tourists and consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the finance chief congratulated épée fencer Vivian Kong for securing Hong Kong's first Paris Olympics gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a Facebook post, Chan said Kong has showcased her exceptional skills and perseverance in her comeback victory, making all Hongkongers thrilled and excited.
