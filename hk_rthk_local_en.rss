 Police said they arrested 100 people who were allegedly involved in cases of fraud and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 75, were involved in 82 cases related to investments, online employment and online romance scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the cases involved a total of HK$180 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief inspector Cheng Ki-fung said the suspects were mostly stooge account holders of syndicates, who were responsible for collecting or managing the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said one of the cases involved 54 victims who had bought coupons online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suspects employed many different defrauding tricks. Different kinds of coupons appeared in different cases. They also sold different coupons during different festivals," Cheng said.

    Worldcoin ordered to get its eyes off Hongkongers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cryptocurrency project Worldcoin has been ordered to cease operations in Hong Kong after breaching privacy rules through its iris scans and collection of face images, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner launched a probe into Worldcoin after raiding six of its premises around Hong Kong in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, provides a digital passport with free Worldcoin cryptocurrency tokens, but participants first have to have their faces and eyeballs scanned to verify they are human and unique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 8,300 people in Hong Kong signed up, but many didn't know what they were agreeing to and the data taken from them was unnecessary and excessive, said Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) Ada Chung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldcoin was found to have breached several parts of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including by failing to explain to participants the risks regarding disclosure of their biometric data and by planning to keep personal information for up to 10 years in order to use it to train artificial intelligence models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy commissioner said another breach was that Worldcoin did not provide information to participants in Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The PCPD was of the view that participants using Chinese as native language would not be able to clearly understand the relevant policies and practices, terms and conditions of the Worldcoin project, and hence there was a lack of transparency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said members of the public should contact it immediately if they find that Worldcoin is continuing to carry out iris-scanning in the territory.

    MTR projects up for tender again

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the MTR Corporation (MTRC) on Wednesday said the railway giant had been successful in its recent property sales with the market picking up, adding the Tung Chung East project would be tendered again, after the MTRC failed to receive any bids last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rex Auyeung and Jacob Kam, the firm’s CEO, were speaking to reporters ahead of the MTRC’s annual general meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Tung Chung East Station development project will be tendered again in the next 12 months. As for the Siu Ho Wan Depot Site project, we are carrying out preliminary work and we will announce tender details when we are ready," said Auyeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kam said last year's station flooding was due to the impact of flash flooding, not maintenance problems, adding the recently installed flood sensors at 26 stations would now allow for a prompt response by staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the railway operator had put measures in place for dealing with the upcoming typhoon season to ensure the safety of its staff and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During typhoon [signal] No. 9 or above, all train services on the open sections will be suspended. Now, if there are still trains out there running on the open sections during the transition from typhoon 8 to typhoon 9 or above, we will of course try to continue those services already on the open sections to the original destination, or at least to the nearest stations with enough space to let the passengers off the trains so that they can stay in a safe place until the weather improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To do that, we have actually in place our train crew, our maintenance staff, and our station staff to be prepared for that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for plans by Shenzhen authorities to redevelop the control point at Lo Wu to allow for smoother connectivity between the two locations, Kam said the two sides were still discussing the details and the MTR would cooperate when a decision had been made.

    Govt to submit fire safety amendment bill in July

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk says the government plans higher fines for people who ignore fire safety orders." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754199_1_20240522131156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk on Wednesday said the government expects to submit an amendment bill to Legco in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five people were killed in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan in April, sparking concerns about inadequate safety facilities in old buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Cheuk said the authorities propose raising the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said financial penalties alone would be ineffective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to imprison people to serve a deterrent effect because Hong Kong people don't care about fines, but they certainly don't want to be jailed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said the authorities were looking into including more provisions, including jail terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If someone tries to obstruct the owner's corporation to carry out repair works, is uncooperative or tries to obstruct certain work intentionally, we're considering whether to impose penalties including imprisonment," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the government would not comment on the death of a British man accused by the UK of spying for Hong Kong, while another official said the city’s overseas trade offices would continue their work to promote the SAR and facilitate trade and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were speaking to reporters following a Legco antechamber meeting, after Matthew Trickett was found dead in a park west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett, who was 37, was one of three people arrested earlier this month and charged by UK authorities for allegedly helping to collect intelligence for Hong Kong. Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in London, is a co-defendant in the national security case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Bernard Chan declined to address questions on whether the ETO in London was monitoring the activities of HongKongers in the UK, saying officials would not address online rumours or baseless accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the trade offices would continue to carry out their lawful duties undeterred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The ETO’s task is to liaise with the local government, think tanks, different sectors and all walks of life to try to improve or facilitate or foster the cooperation on trade and investment, and also in the area of art and culture. We will continue to liaise with the local government to tell the good stories of Hong Kong,” he said.

    Corruption erodes faith in rule of law: chief judge

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's head judge on Wednesday said corruption erodes public faith in governments and the rule of law and discourages people from making investments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at an anti-corruption symposium, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said corruption was "the misuse of power" that led to "some not being subject or held accountable under the same rules", placing them above the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption erodes public faith in governments and institutions, where the rule of law is built on public trust," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even the appearance of corruption, never mind corruption on a micro scale, will lead to the erosion of the public's belief in the rule of law. Therefore, if for no other reasons than the upholding of the rule of law in a society, it is vital that corruption be subject to continuing vigilance and efforts to combat it at all levels and in all forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also argued against claims there were potentially economic benefits to corruption, calling such views "exceedingly short-term and narrow".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption is not merely the product of a bad institution, it actually helps create bad institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are likely to be discouraged by corruption from making investments, as they would prefer fair, transparent and competitive markets in order to protect their capital."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is at the forefront of the international fight against corruption, Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday, while vowing to sustain the territory's "pioneering role" in anti-graft work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told the opening ceremony of a symposium in Wan Chai that the SAR has a clean and efficient government and zero tolerance for corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day event, co-hosted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, attracted more than 500 participants, including anti-corruption experts, legal professionals and academics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong maintains a robust regulatory regime in line with international standards, and is renowned globally for its clean and efficient government, level-playing field for doing business, sound rule of law, a judiciary with independent judicial power, and zero tolerance for corruption," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the anti-corruption body had championed the fight against corruption in the city for half a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a priority of the Hong Kong SAR government to sustain our pioneering role in combating corruption. We are pleased and proud to back the ICAC in widening its international network and cooperating with overseas counterparts," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed, as well, to ensuring that our legal framework and anti-corruption institutions, as well as public and private sector governance, reflect the highest international obligations and standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Woo, the commissioner of the anti-graft body, told the same event that the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption had organised 70 training courses for more than 40 agencies around the world since it was established in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there would be a training programme on the use of innovation and technology to combat and prevent corruption following the symposium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A unique feature of this training programme is a three-day study tour to the city of Changsha of China. Participants will witness first-hand China's latest development and anti-corruption initiative during the trip," Woo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also at the symposium was the signing of memoranda of understanding between the ICAC and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as anti-corruption authorities from Kazakhstan, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.

<div class="itemFullText">
 British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

 The Education Bureau has proposed that students taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education economics exam can skip part of the test from 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It came after the bureau announced that students would be allowed to only take the compulsory test for the Chinese history DSE exam from 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a circular published on Monday, the bureau said the requirement for students to choose one of the elective tests would be removed for the economics DSE exam, and that students only sitting the compulsory paper would be rewarded a score of level 5 at most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said this would allow students to focus on studying for the compulsory part of the exam to enhance learning effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the measure would be implemented at secondary 4 starting from the 2025-26 school year, and would apply to the 2028 DSE exams.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.

    Walled City film set could become tourist hotspot

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong on Tuesday said the government is considering turning the film set of local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" into a tourist site.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing on Hong Kong's mega events, Wong said the movie set, which resembles the now-demolished Kowloon Walled City, has been well maintained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With regards to the set used in the movie 'Walled In', discussions are taking place. The set has been dismantled, but it's still there. They've been keeping it in rather good condition," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Discussions are ongoing as to whether they can let us have some parts of the set and it will be put up for display at a suitable location in Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said Hong Kong will host 106 mega events in the latter half of this year, a couple less than the 108 organised in the first six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the events still to come are expected to attract more visitors compared to those already held.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of events taking place in the first half of this year is actually more or less similar to the number of events taking place in the second half. But in terms of scale, we noted that some of the events in the second half actually have a much larger capacity in terms of attracting visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that the number of visitors coming to Hong Kong for those mega events will actually be bigger than those in the first half."

    Pay rises dip this year: Jobsdb

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, says more young people are hoping to work on the mainland.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Salary increases this year are slightly lower than last year, according to a new report by Jobsdb.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The employment platform polled nearly 3,400 workers between February and  March, and found that their average pay rise in 2024 was 3.2 percent. That's almost one percentage point lower than last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employees in analytics had the biggest increase at 7.2 percent, followed by legal and compliance, and engineering at about five percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers in the design, retail sales and manufacturing sectors were at the bottom end with increments of less than one percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The managing director of Jobsdb by SEEK in Hong Kong, Bill Lee, said the lower pay rise should not be a concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is roughly within the range of salary increases in Hong Kong in the last ten years, and this number is also above inflation, which was roughly around two percent in March,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that industries like hospitality and tourism had benefited from the rebounded in visitor numbers, and their staff had a better than average salary rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do see a significant improvement in the salary and benefits package within the hospitality and tourism job functions. Firstly, within this segment, there's an average increase of 4.2 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And over 80 percent of those surveyed within this segment actually received salary increments, so that's a pretty positive outlook.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said that jobseekers, particularly those under 25, had shown more interest in working on the mainland which has become the second most popular destination after Australia for Hongkongers seeking work outside the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The policies implemented by the Hong Kong government to encourage more integration with the Greater Bay Area are probably showing some results, increasing the awareness of young people looking to work in the GBA,” he said.

    RAISe+ results will be published soon: Paul Chan

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday said the government will soon release the results of a scheme aimed at promoting the commercialisation of scientific research results and matching university projects with reliable investors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At the Greater Bay Area Science Forum - Hong Kong Forum at the University of Hong Kong, Chan said the authorities have been rolling out various measures to promote the commercialisation of scientific research results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the measures, he said, is the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) that was launched last October and is aimed at promoting collaboration between the government, universities, as well as the technology and research industries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am very pleased to report to you that the results of the first round of evaluation results of the scheme will be published within this month, and we will fund over 20 projects covering various fields, including health and medical sciences, new materials, new energy, and artificial intelligence robots et cetera,” Chan told the participants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that authorities will also conduct more collaboration with cities in the Greater Bay Area, especially the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, to create a vigorous technology and innovation ecosystem, while matching global capital with scientific institutions and universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said the government will prepare and establish a third InnoHK research and development cluster in the second half of this year, to ramp up the SAR's tech transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new cluster will focus on advanced manufacturing, materials, energy, and sustainable development, while the existing clusters focus on healthcare-related technologies, artificial intelligence, and robotics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, could play a positive role in guiding funds by being a ‘super connector’. The innovation and technology industries as well as the finance industry in the Greater Bay Area can support each other, and they are equivalent to combining the competitive strengths of the San Francisco Bay Area and the New York Bay Area,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief added that over 50 key enterprises, many in the innovation and tech fields, have been attracted to the SAR since late 2022, and it's estimated they will bring in investments worth more than HK$40 billion and create 13,000 jobs in the coming few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some 120,000 individuals have recently arrived in the SAR via the government’s various talent import schemes, with 20 percent of them working in the innovation and technology industries, Chan said.

    CE warns against citizen sting ops on Uber drivers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee urged people without proper training to refrain from mounting sting operations, after taxi drivers went undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cabbies raised eyebrows and caused controversy by travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police had been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee warned there were risks for people taking matters into their own hands, and that they should refer the issue to law enforcement officers instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These operations should be undertaken by law enforcement agencies. And the law enforcement agencies that take these undercover actions will have to abide by rules and regulations. The officers involved have been well-trained. They act within the framework of the law," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need training to handle emergency situations. Without proper training and without adequate legal understanding, I advise people not to do it, because they may break the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also noted the Transport and Logistics Bureau would report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services in July.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that clear key performance indicators (KPIs) must be set for the development and operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, adding that government money must be spent carefully.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment ahead of the weekly Exco meeting after the chairman of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, Henry Tang, said museums at the arts hub may have to reduce the days they are open unless more funds are secured in the next year or so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government is in communication with the authority regarding viable funding options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have high expectations of the successful operation of the West Kowloon Cultural District, and it has been creating value for Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In many areas, it has been doing a job which satisfies the expectations and wishes of the community and the government, but we want to ensure that there will be a long-term viable financing plan with good KPIs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the district was designed to be self-financing following its initial endowment from the government.

  His comments came after a survey by the Chinese-language newspaper Ta Kung Pao found that more than 90 percent of the 30,000 people polled were against the pay-as-you-throw scheme, while more than 70 percent said it should be scrapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The scheme has been on trial since April in 14 different locations, including at homes, shops and restaurants. Officials had previously said it remained to be seen whether a full roll-out would take place as planned on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, the CE said the government was assessing the experience gained during the trial and the challenges that may arise in implementing the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He stressed the government was taking the views of society seriously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In my opinion, a policy that would affect more than seven million citizens should be carefully considered. Even though the law was drafted before this government took office, we should still consider how to implement it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will explain to the Legislative Council next week what we have learnt from the pilot, the problems we have identified and the feedback we have received from the community, including through the media."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said internet service providers have been complying with a court injunction against the protest song "Glory to Hong Kong".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters on Tuesday ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said hyperlinks to the song could no longer be found on local platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've noted that there's no link shown on any local platform relating to the song, and also Google Search doesn't show any link to the song in question either," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will continue to monitor the situation to see whether there is any non-compliance with the court order. If we notice such instances, then we will notify the platform on the contents of the court order."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction against the protest song, banning anyone with seditious intent from playing or performing it on national security grounds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said last week that it would comply with the court ruling, restricting viewing of 32 banned links related to the song in Hong Kong.

    HK to host over 200 mega events this year: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="HK to host over 200 mega events this year: CE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754004_1_20240521104618.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is set to host dozens more mega events this year which were expected to draw millions of visitors, Chief Executive John Lee announced on Tuesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city's leader also said arts and culture shows, sports competitions, trade exhibitions and financial summits would be among the more than 100 events held in the latter half of the year, including brand new ones such as a performing arts expo and a fashion design week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The total number of mega events over the year is increased from 150 to [over] 210. That means there will be [at least] one mega event every two days," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think that these mega events will attract about 1.7 million visitors. They will bring with them about HK$7.2 billion, which is about HK$4.3 billion in economic gain.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Hong Kong welcomed more than 14 million visitors in the first four months, double from the same period a year ago, and that there was a surge of tourists coming from the United States, Canada and Indonesia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We reckon that for every 1.5 million visitors, there will be a 0.1 percent growth in GDP. For long-term stay visitors, they will bring even a higher percentage point in growth of our GDP," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added his administration would seek more measures from Beijing that benefits the SAR, including raising the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shaman Chellaram, a senior director in valuation and advisory services at the investment management firm Colliers, said the strong Hong Kong dollar had discouraged people from visiting, as it is more expensive for tourists to travel to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Chellaram said these mega events could offer tourists a variety of new experiences and attractions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People are always attracted to exciting things. And what we're seeing in the market at the moment is that the global travel trend is geared towards more experiences. And if those mega events that the city has planned out for the rest of the year can really curate a unique experience, then that will really lead to a jump in tourism numbers," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chellaram also believed that having mega events would boost the local tourism industry by bringing in more visitors to the SAR.

    MTR stations better protected from storm flooding
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The MTR has placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753946_2_20240520220635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR has installed a flood detection system at 26 stations, to prepare for the coming rain and typhoon season.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The initiative comes after Wong Tai Sin Station was flooded during a heavy downpour last September, resulting in the partial suspension of the Kwun Tong Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, the MTR’s Chief of Airport Segment, Ben Lui, said the rail giant had placed flood sensors at 42 entrances and exits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When water reaches the sensors, it will trigger an alarm to the station staff. Upon receiving the alarm, the staff will check the CCTV to confirm if there is flooding. If there is flooding, our staff will set flood barriers and temporarily cordon off the affected area. There will also be announcements for the public to use other exits to leave the station," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui also said the MTR would suspend all services on above ground sections of the network, including the light railway and airport express, whenever the typhoon signal No. 9 or higher was in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, if trains were still above ground when the second-highest typhoon signal was raised, they would continue to their designated destinations, or at least to major stations such as Yuen Long or Sha Tin, where passengers could find shelter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR would also provide water and food for affected passengers under such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Gary Zhang said the newly installed flood sensors at station exits would provide early alerts to MTR staff, enabling them to proactively prevent flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Zhang, who's a former MTR engineer, expressed concerns regarding the safety of station staff who would need to set up flood-proof barriers themselves amid extreme weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even for a small station like Wong Tai Sin, there are more than eight entrances, and each entrance has to be installed with floodblocks manually by the station staff. And the manpower is definitely still a concern and also a constraint," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang said the rail operator was thinking about installing automatic flood-proof barriers at stations to minimise the risks to staff safety.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s jobless rate remained stable at three percent in the three-month period ending in April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures from the Census and Statistics Department showed that the underemployment rate also remained unchanged, at 1.1 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 5,700 people were newly employed during the three-month period, bringing the total employment number to 3.69 million. The labour force, meanwhile, increased by about 7,700 to 3.8 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, some 2,000 people became jobless during the period, sending the total number of unemployed to 113,700.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The number of underemployed people stood at 40,500, largely unchanged compared with the previous three-month period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commenting on the latest figures, labour chief Chris Sun said the unemployment rates of various sectors remained low in general, with only small changes observed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he expects "continued economic growth" to keep the labour market tight in the near term.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also noted that there was a monthly average of 75,425 vacancies in the private sector between February and April, which was a decrease of nearly 30 percent on a yearly basis and a drop of 2.7 percent compared with the first three months of the year.

    Label issued to "smart and safe" construction sites

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau and Construction Industry Council have launched a new programme to encourage the use of the Smart Site Safety System on construction sites, with applications open on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sites that successfully implement the system, which includes features like centralised management platforms, monitoring devices for frontline staff and electric locks for hazardous areas, would now be recognised with a label.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony of the programme, Development Secretary Bernadette Linn explained the participation rate for the safety system, especially for private sites, was still relatively low, and such labels were believed to increase their safety awareness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The programme aims to encourage more construction sites to adopt the Smart Site Safety System by providing them with a label, or a ‘plaque’, to identify and facilitate monitoring of those sites that have properly installed and applied the system,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We estimate that the first batch of about 100 construction sites will receive the label by July this year.  With an estimated minimum of 500 sites participating, we hope to have all labels issued by the end of the year, covering over 60 percent of all construction sites.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said such labels would be displayed at strategic spots outside the construction sites for recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In other words, everyone will know which sites have such labels. For sites that don’t have such labels. Obviously relevant government departments will pay more attention during their usual inspections. And the construction industry will know which sites haven’t implemented the Smart Site Safety System. I believe this will create a certain pressure,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn added that sites should still be cautious even if they have been issued the “plaque”, saying it could still be scrapped if they don't perform site safety properly.

    More mobilised civil servants report on time: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung on Monday said more public servants were able to report for duty on time under a mobilisation protocol used during a government-wide drill on handling emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The exercise last month simulated a situation where a super typhoon was approaching Hong Kong, with civil servants called up to assist residents in low-lying areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, Yeung said the exercise showed that public servants had improved their internal communication, compared to the first drill held about a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Civil Service Bureau] worked with different bureaus and departments and we were able to contact all staff required within 40 minutes. And the relevant bureaus and departments also, within a short period time, contacted their staff members. So 99 percent of our staff members were able to arrive at the designated locations within a specified time. This shows that the communication mechanism worked," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung added that authorities were able to swiftly deliver supplies from storage facilities set up across the city to specified locations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung, of the Federation of Trade Unions, raised concerns about civil servants having to catch up their usual work after being deployed under the mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Yeung said she believes bureaus and departments would take a "compassionate approach".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Say, if the mobilisation exercise [on a work day] completes at 5.30pm, no staff will be asked to go back to their original post to finish their work. The work will be shared among other colleagues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government-wide mobilisation went into effect twice last year, with hundreds of civil servants deployed to help clear up the aftermath of Super Typhoon Saola as well as following torrential downpours in September.

    No delay to stock market adverse weather plan: govt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Christopher Hui on Monday said the government will not delay plans to start keeping the stock markets open during severe weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after reports suggested the authorities could delay bringing in the change until the end of the year or early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending the China Private Equity Summit, Hui said officials are sticking to the original timeline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our timeline has not been changed, and it's been clear the whole time. That is, we'll announce relevant details of the implementation by the middle of this year when we publish the results of the public consultation on this regard,” Hui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And when the markets are ready, we'll start implementing relevant arrangements.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No date for the move has been set.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Hui told participants at the summit that Hong Kong remains competitive when it comes to firms raising capital, and authorities will continue to attract leading enterprises from the mainland to list in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hui also said the SAR government will publish a policy statement regarding the development of artificial intelligence (AI) by the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “AI is already being applied in various areas of banking, securities, insurance, accounting, retirement, protection and green finance in Hong Kong,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government will strive to capitalise on the opportunities brought by AI while also managing the risks and challenges.”

    Leave policing to the police: taxi association chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi drivers should not be going undercover to try to tackle unlicensed ride-hailing services and the matter should be left to the police, an industry spokesman said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Videos online appear to show cabbies travelling as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, chairman of the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, told RTHK he does not agree with such an approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added, however, that there were only 33 prosecutions over unlicensed ride-hailing services last year and the taxi trade is disappointed with the amount of action taken by the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ride-hailing services are legal, but if these companies do not verify whether or not the cars in service have a hire car permit, the insurance of these cars already becomes invalid. This becomes a problem for all road users including third-party vehicles, pedestrians, passengers and even the driver of the ride-hailing car," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there is a serious accident and there's no compensation for casualties, people would criticise the SAR's governance and nobody wants to see that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said he hopes plans for new fleets of taxis will improve services, leading to less demand for ride-hailing firms.

    'Smaller Olympic presence will still be a success'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tony Choi, who heads the Hong Kong Sports Institute, says he hopes Hong Kong can win medals in every Olympic Games from now on.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive of the Hong Kong Sports Institute, Tony Choi, said on Sunday that qualifying for fewer events at the Paris Olympics compared with the Tokyo Games will still be considered a success for Hong Kong athletes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Choi estimated that Hong Kong would qualify for about 30 events in all disciplines this time, about 10 fewer than in Tokyo three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the SAR's success at the Tokyo Games was partly due to its Covid-19 measures, which minimised the pandemic's impact on elite athletes' training and gave Hong Kong the edge over other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong won one gold, two silver and three bronze medals in Tokyo, its best showing at an Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Hong Kong Sports Institute was preparing for the Tokyo Olympics, we didn't stop training for a single day. I believe many countries and regions couldn't do that. So back then, we had such advantages," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time, we're getting more than 30 tickets, which is still reaching our target."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi also expressed hopes of breaking the pattern of Hong Kong winning medals every other Olympics, since windsurfer Lee Lai-shan captured gold in Atlanta in 1996 for the city's first medal ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We got a medal in the 1996 [Olympics], then in 2000 we didn’t. And in 2004 we had one and 2008 we didn’t. 2012 we got a medal then 2016 we didn’t... Honestly speaking, the Hong Kong team’s results are relatively inconsistent. We hope everything can be more stable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We hope to win at least a medal in every Olympics... We need to maintain a stable performance in the international sports scene in order to compete with other sports powerhouses.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said Hong Kong is already competitive in sports such as fencing, swimming, table tennis, badminton, karate and squash, and it'll take time to catch up in other disciplines.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Sunday said they have arrested two people on suspicion of vandalising a tombstone in Tseung Kwan O Chinese Permanent Cemetery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to video circulating online, it belonged to Wong Ka-kui, the late singer of the now-disbanded musical band, Beyond.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video purportedly showed someone smashing the tombstone with a hammer, as well as spraying liquid and writing with a black marker on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the pair arrested are aged 15 and 23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on social media, a former member of Beyond, Yip Sai-wing, called the incident "truly outrageous" and said anyone found guilty of carrying out the act must be punished.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong died in 1993 at the age of 31.

    Turn Kai Tak Covid facility into arts &amp; sport hub: DAB

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Sunday called on the government to transform the disused Covid isolation facility in Kai Tak into a base for the arts and sport.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, lawmaker Starry Lee said the facility, spanning around 80,000 square metres, has remained unused for a long time while incurring a monthly maintenance cost of HK$400,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now, we believe it is a good time to sort of restructure and reshape (it) as an international exchange art, sport hub, because this can leverage on the existing facility including the opening of the sport centre in Kai Tak area and also we have the cruise terminal," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are expecting more tourists to come through the cruise terminal."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, who represents the Kowloon Central geographical constituency, suggested the government develop a water sports centre, a dedicated space for youth art creation, as well as an exhibition area to showcase Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage within the Kai Tak complexes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said the transportation facilities in the Kai Tak area are inadequate, and called on the government to expedite the development of an eco-transportation system there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last month, Secretary for Development Bernadette Linn told the Legislative Council that the government was considering turning the Covid-19 isolation facility in Kai Tak into a hub for the cultural and creative industries.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they have seized about 225 kilograms of suspected cocaine at a warehouse in Ta Kwu Ling and arrested two men.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the haul had a market value of HK$204 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the suspected drugs were hidden among containers said to be carrying scrap iron and shipped from the South American country of Suriname.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers raided the warehouse in Ping Che on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our investigation reviewed that the drug-trafficking syndicate employed some, we believe, unwitting truck workers to assist them to dismantle approximately those 40 tonnes of scrap iron from the containers, with the syndicate overseeing the unloading,” superintendent Wilson Tam said in a press briefing on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Subsequently, our officers conducted the raid, and we found two workers and arrested the other two suspected members of the drug syndicate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair, aged 22 and 29, were held on suspicion of trafficking in dangerous drugs and will appear before Fanling Magistrates' Courts on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam added that intelligence indicated the suspected drugs were being stored in Hong Kong before they were to be sold in other countries.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said while the macro-economy and investment sentiment have improved in recent months, not all industries in Hong Kong are recovering at the same pace.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his weekly blog, Chan noted that local stocks traded near nine-month highs earlier this month and home prices rebounded in March after a 10-month fall, but he acknowledged that retailers and restaurant operators still face challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, the recovery is still uneven among different industries. The retail and catering sectors are still adapting to the challenges brought by changes in the consumption patterns of residents and tourists," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to market changes, we take the initiative and strive to create more favourable market conditions and atmospheres. We work with the business community to create new opportunities of growth for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the government will announce shortly mega events planned for the second half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He vowed to create tourism experiences with unique characteristics of the SAR to boost consumption.

  The incident involved oil tanks on Wang Lok Street, and Fire Services Department officers were called in just before 1am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Members of the public who are being affected by the smoke and an unusual odour carried by the wind are advised to close their doors and windows and stay calm," a government statement said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Jockey Club on Saturday announced that it's boosting the prize fund for special Snowball draws in its Mark Six lottery, making the big-money jackpots more frequent and larger.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The club said it would start the new arrangements from Tuesday's draw, with more money being held back for the Snowball. It says the number of Snowball draws will rise from about seven per year to 12, while the top prize will be up to HK$100 million for some draws.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said in a statement: "The Snowball draw is a major attraction of the Mark Six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The club said the minimum prize for regular draws would remain unchanged at HK$8 million, while other variable and fized prize allocations would also stay the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that the majority of lottery revenue after payouts goes on benefitting the Hong Kong community, with 40 percent of lottery turnover going on taxes or into the lotteries fund.

    Truck driver arrested over light rail incident

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they have arrested a truck driver on suspicion of causing a light rail carriage to derail, and disrupting light rail services in the western New Territories for about three hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is suspected that a plank, measuring 50 centimetres by 20 centimetres, fell from the truck the man was driving onto the light rail tracks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers arrested the 49-year-old man for alleged dangerous driving.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident occurred at around 9:40am, when a carriage derailed near Chung Uk Tsuen Station and affected light rail routes 610, 614, 615, and 715.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As a result, services were suspended at Lam Tei, Nai Wai, Chung Uk Tsuen and Hung Shui Kiu stations. But there were no injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation said it's investigating the incident, adding a preliminary investigation found that the train involved was not speeding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing sources, lawmaker Gary Zhang, the deputy chairman of the subcommittee on matters relating to railways at the Legislative Council, said the incident happened at a busy crossing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Although the incident is unrelated to the operations and maintenance of the light rail services, I think the MTR Corporation can still use technology to prevent similar incidents from happening again. For example, they can consider installing AI cameras at its junctions, or maybe install some vehicle-based detection systems so that early detections can be done,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zhang doesn't expect the incident to trigger any penalty mechanisms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the city’s transport chief Lam Sai-hung said that he had expressed concern about the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has conducted an immediate investigation at the scene of the incident and will study improvement measures along with the MTR Corporation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday said there are more companies than ever in Hong Kong, which shows that the city is a vibrant, reliable and convenient place to do business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau said there are over 1.43 million local companies and around 15,000 non-local firms as of April - both record high figures for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said new companies were emerging, outnumbering those that folded by about 4,600 last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, it said the number of bankruptcy and winding up petitions fell in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities received 742 bankruptcy and 66 winding up petitions last month. The figures were slightly lower than those in March, but still at least 30 percent up from a year ago.

    'Double peak flu seasons' by two virus strains: doctor

<div class="itemFullText">
 An infectious disease expert on Saturday warned that Hong Kong could be hit by a double whammy in which its peak influenza seasons are dominated by two flu virus strains - one after another this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Ivan Hung, who's also a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said that influenza virus infections have rebounded to a relatively high level recently, as residents have low immunity to influenza after three years of the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the peak flu season dominated by the A subtype H3 virus strain ended last October, infections have continued this year and the SAR also has to contend with a peak season dominated by the A subtype H1 flu virus strain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In January we have already had the influenza peak season for the subtype H3 virus, and then starting in April and May, we had the peak season that's dominated by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While the H1 virus-led inflections might ease from June and July, there's a chance that we might see the H3 virus making a comeback to form another small peak season from August and September,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think overall, the H3 virus-dominated peak season might be less serious compared with the one seen last year,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The infectious disease expert again called on parents to take their children to get a flu vaccine shot prior to the summer vacation, as there were many serious cases of children infected by the subtype H1 virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted that the city’s Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases had recommended that the Department of Health increase the procurement of the nasal vaccine to raise vaccination rates, as young children were more willing to receive the nasal vaccine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Hung predicted that the new Covid variant - KP.2 strain - that was discovered in the city’s sewage system, will replace the current prevalent variant - JN.1 - as the dominant Covid strain. But he said the new variant will not cause severe cases.

    Cash-strapped arts hub warns of opening restrictions

<div class="itemFullText">
 The cash-strapped West Kowloon Cultural District on Saturday said the M+ and palace museums may have to restrict the days on which they open unless the government replies promptly to its financial proposals.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tang, who chairs the cultural district authority's board, told i-Cable News that they have already handed in plans as to what to do when the authority's funds are drained next year, but the administration has not responded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government should have also completed a study into the authority's finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said the arts hub will run out of money in June 2025, and that it's now taking loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the government delays [giving us a reply], we'll need to take big steps to cut costs. For example, the museums might just open four days a week, instead of six. The Xiqu centre may also open on fewer days," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But will this be fair to the public? After all, this is not a commercial undertaking but a key public policy project."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang added that restricting the days the facilities open will also go against the national policy to establish Hong Kong as a hub for cultural exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had earlier told local newspapers that they did not wish to request more public money, but could shore up the cultural quarter's finances by selling part of its 40 hectares of land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a decision on their funding proposal will have to be made by June to enable contracts to be signed for new exhibitions and projects.

    'Govt poverty alleviation strategy not precise'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, says while government projects to tackle poverty have good feedback, they only support a limited number of people. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753673_2_20240518115702.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Social welfare lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen on Saturday criticised the government’s latest strategy to ease poverty by saying that such strategies are not “precise” or “accurate” in alleviating poverty as they did not include other groups that also require social support.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remarks came after authorities earlier identified around 950,000 elderly people, single parent households, and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tik said the latest strategy could not comprehensively reflect the city’s poverty situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am not against having these target groups, but I think there aren't enough targeted groups, because there are also the disabled, the chronically ill, the mentally ill, and so on. So I think it's not 'broad' enough in terms of identifying the families who need key assistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, the targeted groups are also not 'precise' enough, as it's very general to say that there are over 900,000 people [in these groups], but what about different levels… within them?” he commented, adding that the strategy is not “accurate”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The legislator also believes that the government must maintain and improve the so-called “poverty line”, instead of “abandoning” the gauge, as it could reflect whether those targeted measures to tackle poverty are having an effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The poverty line uses Hong Kong median household income as the sole gauge to measure poverty. The government earlier said such a gauge is no longer appropriate, and it will come up with a more accurate way of monitoring poverty levels later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The latest strategy is target group-based, and the poverty line is income-based, these two have different calculation methods and are not comparable,” Tik noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chua Hoi-wai, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, which represents some 480 non-governmental social services organisations, said some government-led projects to tackle poverty aren't effective enough in offering help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He cited the “Strive and Rise Programme” the government set up as an example and said that such a project, despite having positive feedback in recent times, is only supporting a limited number of people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There were about 2,000 pupils covered in the previous cohort under the programme, and about 4,000 covered in the current cohort. All these numbers are far [smaller] compared with poverty figures showing tens of thousands," Chua told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme cited was aimed at addressing inter-generational poverty issues by pairing under-privileged students with volunteer mentors - along with financial support:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government might need to explain to the public why the number of assisted pupils is so small?” he asked.

    Taxi industry has got to change: transport minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport minister Lam Sai-hung on Saturday said future taxi fleets will have to allow digital payments, install video recording technology, and should respond to complaints.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam told a Commercial Radio programme that he hopes this government initiative to step up taxi management will enhance service standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the fleet management will... shift the culture of the whole taxi industry, because we have got to change. If we go on like this, the taxi industry will just get worse and people will have less and less confidence in it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said applications for taxi fleet licences are closing at the end of the month, and the licences will be issued in mid-2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the fleets should start operating within a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lam said the upcoming taxi fare hike is needed so the industry can stay financially sustainable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said taxi drivers earned HK$17,000 to HK$20,000 a month on average last year, and some of them had seen their income fall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After taking into account inflation, some taxi drivers - for example those working on Lantau - earned a lower income than they did in 2019. We think this isn't good for the taxi sector's long term development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cost of gas and insurance have also gone up. We considered these factors before reaching the decision."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said they had also considered if people would accept a fare hike, before announcing that flagfall for all taxis will rise by HK$2 from July 14.

    SAR's health sector needs to be 'innovation driver'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau (left) is upbeat on the prospects for the SAR's health and dental sector - as long as it continues to innovate.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health minister Lo Chung-mau said on Saturday that he's confident that Hong Kong's high quality healthcare and dental services will remain competitive, even though some local patients have been heading north for services on the mainland that are cheaper.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said while some patients think the mainland offers better value-for-money services, the SAR has nothing to worry about so long as the profession keeps improving its services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lo said on RTHK's Your Home Address programme that as the government seeks to develop the SAR as an international health and medical innovation hub, Hong Kong can also drive advancement in the field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has excellent health care service and we have a wonderful university here with a medical school and a dental school. We're not just good in providing service, we should be good in innovation as well," the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we are good, we have all the talents, enough talents, we should actually not be looking just at providing services. We should be driving, we should be the driver for innovation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that a Hospital Authority initiative to offer medical staff low-interest home loans to retain talent has been going well, with some 80 percent - or more than a thousand applications approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo expressed the hope that upcoming legal changes that would allow more non-locally trained healthcare professionals to practice in the SAR will help ease the staffing shortage.

    E-CNY pilot scheme expanded to HK for the first time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced that a pilot electronic renminibi programme had been expanded to Hong Kong to include cross-border usage of the digital currency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It marks the first time since the launch of the e-CNY pilot scheme in 2019 that the nation's official digital currency was available for use outside of the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The programme, backed by Beijing, allows Hong Kong residents to open digital yuan wallets using a local mobile number via an app developed by China's central bank - the People's Bank of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The expansion of the programme permits users to make payments in retail shops and some online stores in Hong Kong, Macau and other Greater Bay Area cities as well as in other places covered by the pilot scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hongkongers who use the e-CNY wallets can pay up to 2,000 yuan for each transaction, and are limited to use up to 50,000 yuan worth of purchases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The apps are operated by four mainland banks, namely Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank as well as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, while users can top up their e-CNY wallets from 17 banks, including HSBC, Hang Seng Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the authority's deputy chief executive, Howard Lee, said the expansion of the pilot scheme would make it more convenient for Hongkongers to shop on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is going to provide an additional means, a safe and secure means for people in Hong Kong to use this wallet across the border when they go there and they have a need to make a payment, or vice versa for mainland users coming to Hong Kong," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are already some other means that can be used for this purpose, but we thought that different people might have different preferences, so one more option is always better than one fewer option."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Hong Kong users currently cannot make peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, or electronic money transfers from oneself to another through the e-CNY wallets.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer who was earlier found guilty of mortgage fraud involving more than HK$26 million was sentenced on Friday to six and a half years in jail.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Harbour Chan was convicted in April of two counts of fraud in connection with two mortgage applications made in 2019 involving a luxury house in Tai Po and a flat in Tung Chung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Co-defender former chief inspector Wong Ho-ngai was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for one count of fraud.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In mitigation, Chan's lawyer requested the court to consider an appropriate reduction in sentence given that the defendant grew up in a less privileged family and his enthusiasm in participating in public welfare activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy District Judge Edward Wong said the sentencing starting points for the two charges were set at six and a half years and three and a half years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Considering the defendant's good personal background and special social contributions, a discretionary reduction in sentence was granted, resulting in a sentence of six and a half years.

    Govt greenlights San Tin environmental study

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said it has given conditional approval to the environmental study into a plan to turn fish ponds in the northern New Territories into a technology hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The department's director, Samuel Chui, said the environmental impact assessment on the San Tin Technopole project took into account a large number of ecological survey findings, and officials did not receive any feedback concerning issues the report did not cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The report is scientific, professional and comprehensive. And it doesn't underestimate the ecological value of the area being studied," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui added that amendments to the report submitted by the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), such as birds' names and photos as well as a draft plan to create habitats for animals, did not affect the effectiveness of the study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said conditions for the approval include that the CEDD has to submit detailed designs for the project and that it must refrain from filling in fish ponds in the area before creating a new one in a conservation park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the CEDD also needs to set up a panel, consisting of green group members and government representatives, to monitor the development's impact on the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The committee will work together to give the best environmental protection," he said. "Just like this time, we have heard many proposals and we will discuss and find the best way to protect the environment and also to conserve the species and the ecology in the area."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the CEDD is taking measures to protect Eurasian Otters, a species of conservation importance. The animals were recorded back in 2019, but were not found during a recent ecological survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the department is adopting suggestions from green groups on building passages for the otters, as well as improving the design of buildings so birds will not crash into them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau, for its part, welcomed the approval, saying it provides a solid foundation for the government to proceed with the next stage of the town planning process and commence the project as scheduled.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A minimum area of at least 100 square feet, including the toilet and kitchen, as well as ensuring proper ventilation and drainage, were among the recommendations made by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors in its report to a government task force on subdivided units.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various fire protection measures should also be implemented, the institute noted, including no open flame cooking, partition walls installed between units that could block fire for at least one hour, as well as providing a clear fire escape route.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other recommendations include having at least one openable window towards open space and separating the kitchen and toilet properly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute estimated that about 30 percent of the 110,000 subdivided flats in the city do not meet these minimum standards and require improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenny Tse, who chairs the institute’s Building Policy Panel, said that generally it would only cost owners tens of thousands dollars to improve their flats, adding that almost all upgrades could be carried out without affecting the building's common area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “All the proposed enhancements should be carried out within the subdivided units, not related to the common areas. For example, the fire service installation, we only need to buy a fire extinguisher, smoke detector or something like that,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the drainage part, this is the only one they need to connect to the common drainage pipe, but I think that this is feasible and also easy to carry out."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute also proposed a registration system for subdivided flats, saying owners must entrust professionals to inspect and accredit the units. Such inspection has to be conducted every three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said owners of sub-standard units should be given 12 months to make improvements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have to take care of the over 100,000 subdivided units in existing markets and we think that we cannot treat the 100,000 subdivided units at one time,” said Nathan Lee, who heads the institute’s Building Surveying Division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So we should allow some time for the owners to take care of the existing tenants and also provide some relocation for the existing tenants. So we propose 12 months for the modification period.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute added these were just temporary solutions and the ultimate solution to the subdivided unit issue remained increasing public housing supply.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday said they were concerned about growing congestion around the Western Harbour Crossing, after changes to tolls made it the busiest of the three harbour tunnels.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures show that since a shake-up of tolls in December, traffic flow at the Western Harbour Crossing has increased by 18 percent to around 103,000 vehicles a day, with queues at peak times getting longer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Deputy Commissioner for Transport Leung Sai-ho said officials are planning to construct an additional lane at the exit of the tunnel on the Hong Kong Island side.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, there's a bottleneck area... I'm sure the project will have a positive impact on the traffic queue and the vehicle speed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we can increase the capacity of the road section, we believe this can improve the overall performance of the Western Harbour Crossing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the extra lane is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 and to be completed by 2027.

    'Green finance to help HK develop hydrogen energy'

Photo courtesy of Civic Exchange" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753456_1_20240516215103.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday said Hong Kong, being an international financial hub, can speed up the development of hydrogen power through financing initiatives that invest in green and sustainable sources of energy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Civic Exchange made the recommendation in its study of the clean energy source, before the government publishes its strategy on the topic in the first half of 2024 in a bid to de-carbonise the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The think tank's research analyst Wing Tsang said the recently released Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance would make it easier for businesses to identify and invest in green hydrogen projects which were completely zero-carbon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the SAR could also learn from South Korea, where green bonds are issued to finance hydrogen infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong is an international financial centre, [we] can line up with the banking institutions, the financial institutions, businesses and the government to make the hydrogen transition happen," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang added the government also needs to address the high costs and insufficient infrastructure of hydrogen energy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong currently has no secure and stable supply of hydrogen, and we must identify available sources of hydrogen locally and in close proximity to Hong Kong to propel the application of hydrogen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The think tank also urged authorities to approve more pilot projects to speed up the development and adoption of hydrogen energy in the city.

    New law proposed to help contractors get paid on time

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Development Bureau on Thursday proposed legislation to make it easier for contractors in the construction sector to get paid on time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The bill would allow a contractor to claim payment every month, even if it's not specified in their contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That's a change from the current situation, under which disputes are normally settled only when a contract ends.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bill would also create a new mechanism for settling disputes. A claimant would be able to take their case to an adjudicator, who would make a decision within 55 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If payment doesn't arrive, the claimant would be able to suspend or slow down work, and extend the construction period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it wants to see disputes settled sooner, so everyone involved can get their money faster. It said contractors should see their finances improve, so they can pay workers on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials expect the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to pass later this year and to take effect next year.

    'Social workers may be banned for life by convictions'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun stressed to lawmakers that social worker licencing decisions will still be made by the sector's regulatory body in futre." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753418_1_20240516165846.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday said social workers could in future be banned from the profession for life, if they were convicted of a crime which could warrant a prison sentence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It is among a series of proposed legal changes the administration said would improve the statutory body overseeing the profession, as it accused the body of deviating from the spirit of the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials want to reform the Social Workers Registration Board such that there'd be more appointed members than elected ones, while in future, all 27 board members would need to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the plan, social workers convicted of lesser offences that may be considered to harm the reputation of the profession would also be subject to a permanent expulsion, or a ban of no more than five years as decided by the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The person concerned could write to the board within 28 days to oppose the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for more serious crimes such as national security offences, murder, sex offences and child abuse, the board would promptly expel the social worker unless the whole board votes otherwise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Thursday described the proposals as nothing major, stressing that deregistration decisions would continue to be made by the board.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're not amending such broad principles [over deregistration]. What we're saying is that we mustn't and shouldn't wait, and there's a new provision to allow for the prompt removal," he told lawmakers at a special Legco panel meeting on the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also accused the current board of dereliction of duty for not taking any steps to implement legal changes related to national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it should have actively gathered information on whether social workers seeking to renew their licences "may have committed security-related crimes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, New People's Party's Judy Chan expressed concern that social services would be under affected after the changes, saying there might be a scenario where a group of social workers were disqualified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister dismissed this, saying he thinks most social workers shouldn't have a problem getting their licences renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also stressed the legal amendments only require future board members to take an oath, rather than all registered social workers.

    Govt unveils new measures to cope with extreme weather

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Thursday announced a series of measures intended to help Hong Kong cope better with extreme weather, including new arrangements for MTR services when the second-highest typhoon signal is in force.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains on overground sections of the network will continue until the end of the line, or at least to a large station where passengers can take shelter, instead of only stopping at the next station when the No 9 typhoon signal is in force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, scores of travellers were left stranded at the the airport when Typhoon Koinu forced the suspension of the Airport Express and all bus services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In case the train is already in this open section, we will try to reach the final destination as far as practicable and safety permitting," Transport Secretary Lam Sai-hung said at a cross-departmental press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If not, we're now planning to stop at a major station in which that station may be big or may be connected to the mall or other commercial areas so that people or passengers could have a better place for shelter so that they can depart the area when the weather allows."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk warned that people who deliberately and repeatedly put themselves in jeopardy during extreme weather may face fines or even prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk gave the example of people going onto beaches that are closed, adding that the risk is simply not worth it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we're aiming to do is dissuade people from having some sort of high risk, very risky activities. If anything happens, it's not just costing them HK$2,000 or 14 days in prison. It will cost their life. It's also endangering the life of my emergency response officers. So what we're saying is do not do something dangerous. Do not put yourself at risk," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also said the observatory will issue advice and warnings to members of the public during adverse weather, adding that a city-wide SMS alert system is only reserved for "unforeseen situations" such as tsunamis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about arrangements when water is discharged from the Shenzhen Reservoir, officials said they will alert Hongkongers as soon as authorities across the border start considering such a move.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Children’s Hospital on Thursday said it would open the SAR's first breast milk bank next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It would collect milk from breastfeeding mothers who produce surplus milk, which would then be used to help premature and critically ill babies whose mothers were unable to breastfeed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank would only accept donations from healthy mothers who don't smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Lee Tsz-leung, the hospital's chief executive, said the donated breast milk would benefit the health of premature babies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It carries significant benefits for pre-term babies. It will reduce complication. It will reduce mortality rate. It will reduce the length of stay in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) and also it will promote the neurological development of these premature babies as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The aim is to collect about 800 litres of milk each year, which would benefit up to 600 newborns.

 The Consumer Council on Thursday said many mosquito repellents may not deliver on their marketing, with one brand it checked seemingly attracting the insects instead of keeping them away.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Checks on Cherub Rubs Scatterbugs found that more mosquitos landed on the tester's forearm than before it was applied.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 25 repellent brands examined, only one sample, containing Deet, passed the test perfectly, with no mosquitoes landing on the tester's arm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some natural or herbal brands repelled certain types of mosquito, but not those that spread dengue fever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, said consumers should choose the products carefully.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mosquito repellent products with chemical or natural ingredients each have their own advantages and drawbacks. Consumers may consult physicians and pharmacists and choose suitable products according to usage and health conditions," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also urged the makers of mosquito repellents to list out the ingredients in the label clearly and state whether the product is suitable for children.

    Spam call blocker apps pose privacy risk: watchdog

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Thursday warned that the personal data of people who use apps to block spam callers could be at risk because some of these apps pass on the information to third parties.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog investigated five such apps and found that two of them uploaded details from the user’s list of contacts onto their databases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council found that third parties could then access sensitive details including addresses and the monthly rents the contacts paid.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's suspected these were extracted from the contact lists of landlords or property agents who also used the apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council found that one of the apps would also access up to eight items of personal data, including names, photos and dates of birth, when registered via Facebook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Kenneth Chan, the Vice-Chairman of the council's Publicity and Community Relations Committee, reminded users to stay vigilant when using these apps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Consumers should pay attention to the following when using blocker apps. Read the terms of service and privacy policy before use, and evaluate whether the blocker app is trustworthy and the permission is reasonably commensurate with the functions offered," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite the privacy risk, Chan also called on users to proactively report spam to help apps identify and block the latest telemarketing and spam calls.

<div class="itemFullText">
 World basketball's governing body, FIBA, said on Thursday that it will bring another major tournament to Hong Kong later this year, with the world's best 3x3 men's teams battling it out for the World Tour title.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR, which hosted Olympic qualifying last month, will stage the final of the World Tour for the first time on November 23 and 24.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Li, media director of the local organising committee, said the top 11 teams in the season will automatically qualify for the Hong Kong Final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the team representing Hong Kong will also have a chance to participate if they make it through a play-in tournament against the 12th ranked team and the team with the most combined Challenger and World Tour wins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li said the event will also have a 3x3 village with local influences from the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time we are trying to add some more local culture elements to the carnival. We are trying to make some deal or make some discussion with the authorities in Cheung Chau. We will maybe try to make something different, maybe some local culture things to the November event," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as we will have many more international 3x3 events and also FIBA think we will add a showcase for the tour. We hope it will get more international recognition for Hong Kong as a sport city."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's World Tour will feature 17 stops with Ub Huishan NE looking to defend their title as two-time reigning champions.

    Pay Trend Survey results unveiled

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Tentative results of a Pay Trend Survey that would help adjust civil service pay were released on Thursday, but organisers said it would be "premature" for people to presume the administration will adopt their figures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The survey, based on data gathered from more than 110 private firms, points to rises of 4.01 percent for senior civil servants, 4.32 percent for middle-ranking workers and 5.47 percent for junior staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The numbers are not themselves recommendations in any way for an increase, decrease or anything. They are factors to be considered among a number of other factors," said Laurence Li, who chairs the Pay Trend Survey Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's premature to try to forecast how these things will all be put into the pot."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said other factors to consider when looking at pay rises for civil servants are the state of the economy, changes in the cost of living, the administration's fiscal position, pay claims from staff and civil service morale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service Clement Leung was asked whether different weight will be put on the various factors when making a decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each year, in a way, is a separate exercise, because the economic situation, the situation of the government's fiscal position are different. Every time we will have to have two-way communications with our staff side's representatives," Leung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That will be something that we will have to work on in the next few weeks, and particularly, listening to the views of our staff associations on their sentiments and their views on civil service morale, as well as their proposals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, senior civil servants received pay rises of 2.87 percent, while those in middle and junior ranks got 4.65 percent. This was roughly in line with the results of that year's pay trend survey.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Immigration Department on Thursday announced new ID card replacement arrangements as it prepares to move its headquarters from Wan Chai to Tseung Kwan O in the middle of next month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From June 11, the new headquarters will start providing services, and the Registration of Persons office in Kwun Tong will also be relocated to Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The main services provided by the Registration of Persons Office in Tseung Kwan O include applications for first registration of ID cards, replacement of ID cards due to due to defacement or loss, and amendment of registered particulars on ID cards," said assistant principal immigration officer Wong Ka-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that the Tseung Kwan O office will also handle the replacement of new smart ID cards during extended service hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who have applied for an ID card change on or before June 8 can collect their cards at a temporary office in Kwun Tong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Registration of Persons Office at Immigration Tower in Wan Chai will continue to provide ID card replacement services.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Some 2,500 policymakers, academics and medical professionals on Thursday gathered at the Convention and Exhibition Centre for a two-day summit on health innovation and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Asia Summit on Global Health", jointly organised by the government and the Trade Development Council, features a series of thematic sessions on the latest trends in different medical sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his opening speech, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the importance of public health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Health is wealth. Health is an ever-revolving discipline that affects all of humanity. It affects the lives of every individual in any economy of the world, big or small, rich or poor, liberal or conservative. Public health is the foundation of society and the very basis of humankind to thrive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also told the summit that the SAR thrives as an international metropolis that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the mainland and the rest of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cao Xuetao, the vice-minister of the National Health Commission, told the same event that Hong Kong has been using its geopolitical advantages to promote healthcare development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As an international centre for finance, shipping, trade, innovation and technology, Hong Kong has actively leveraged its advantage of having the strong support of the country and being closely connected to the world to innovate in medicine and health," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland official added that it is crucial to work together and explore new opportunities in the field of medicine and health given complex changes in the international situation.
