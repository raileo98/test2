<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board's executive director on Saturday said he thinks major events like the Victoria Harbour firework and drone displays will still be a big draw for mainland visitors during the Golden Week holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a HOY TV programme, Dane Cheng said he expects more than 800,000 mainland tourists to visit the SAR during the break, but that he doubts the numbers can return to pre-pandemic levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's unrealistic for Hong Kong to return to the tourist figures of 2018 and 2019. Hongkongers find it difficult to accommodate so many tourists, no matter where they come from. Even when taking public transport like the bus and train, or going shopping, there are many people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's important to create a good experience for both visitors and locals. Of course visitors hope to have a good experience when they come, and not encounter crowds everywhere they go."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng added that he is in talks with the government and vendors to see whether the revamped Temple Street Night market can be made permanent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week the Tourism Board announced that the market, part of the government’s "Night Vibes Hong Kong" campaign to spice up the city’s nightlife, would stay until the end of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland's Golden Week break runs between may 1 and May 5.

Police Commissioner praises Mong Kok CCTV cameras

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police Commissioner Raymond Siu on Saturday said security cameras, installed in Mong Kok last month, have helped officers detect two serious crimes. Their installation was the first stage of a government plan to install about 2,000 CCTV cameras across Hong Kong this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending an event, Siu said the surveillance cameras had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In just half a month, we detected two serious crime cases with the help of CCTV cameras. One was related to possessing imitation firearms, and we arrested three men. The other one was a robbery case, and we arrested a man within 24 hours," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After installing these 15 CCTV cameras, we will see if there’s anything we can improve. We will then install 600 cameras at crime black spots across Hong Kong in the middle of this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about privacy concerns, Siu said the Privacy Commissioner had given advice to the government, and that the authorities had also asked an independent consultancy firm to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

    Treasury chief says CSRC measures can be a boon for HK

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Services Minister Christopher Hui on Saturday said a recent move by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide more mainland business for Hong Kong is an opportunity for the SAR's financial sector.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The measures, announced earlier this month, include opening up more Hong Kong-based exchange-traded funds for mainland investors and encouraging mainland companies to list here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Hui said the stock exchange is currently processing around 100 listing applications from outside Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through the efforts of our stock exchange and other parties, we have been promoting the advantages of our Hong Kong listing platform to different potential issuers," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe, with the support of our country's policy, our stock exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission will continue to work hard and encourage more companies to consider using Hong Kong as a listing platform for their financing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about a rise in bankruptcy petitions, Hui said he believed this was due to a number of reasons, including high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is due to several factors. Of course, some past petitions might come back after the pandemic. At the same time, the economic situation could play a part," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The treasury chief added that officials would continue to monitor the changes in the figures before deciding whether action was needed.

    Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs

Winnie Ho plays down light public flat operating costs
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750796_1_L_20240427112917.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Housing Secretary Winnie Ho on Saturday said the operating costs for light public flats should not be compared with traditional public housing units, as the government prepares to take applications for the first of the flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to a question on an RTHK radio show, she said the new flats have a different set of facilities so an exact comparison cannot be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For traditional public flats, the operating cost only includes about HK$500 for cleaning and security, and about HK$400 for maintenance and repair work, so it's a total of about HK$1,000," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there are additional social welfare facilities for light public flats, and there are social welfare organisations providing services for residents. For example, there may be a shared living room for residents, and activities for them. Like transitional housing, there are shops, restaurants, or laundry services for residents."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of the modular temporary units, announced in the 2022 Policy Address to fill the short-term gap in public housing supply, will be completed in Yuen Long in the first quarter of next year. About 2,100 will be available with applications starting in the next few months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho also said she was confident that 30,000 light public housing units would be completed by 2027 at the latest.

    Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister

Public adapting quickly to plastic ban: minister
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750786_2_L_20240427135328.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said the public was adapting quickly to the plastic-free scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban started on Monday, and restaurants are now barred from selling and using plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told a radio programme that authorities had visited about 1,700 retail and catering premises in the past week and almost all of the large chains, and about half of the smaller restaurants, had changed to non-plastic utensils.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of effectiveness, many chain restaurants told us that about 60 to 70 percent of customers, who bought takeaway food, didn't need disposable utensils. This phenomenon is very good because one of the aims of the plastic ban scheme was for people to bring their own utensils," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A chain supermarket was found to be selling sushi in paper boxes this week, with people describing it as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it's unreasonable and unnecessary for supermarkets to use non-plastic packaging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Supermarkets may allow customers to eat at their tables. People normally think it's considered as dine-in, but in this situation, supermarkets expected customers to take out their food. In reality, a lot of people do take away their food," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When supermarkets pack their food, they won't know whether customers will choose to take out or dine in... We think that treating this as takeaway is appropriate, according to the regulations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the quality of non-plastic utensils, Tse said the ban had just begun, and he believed that restaurants would be able to choose better substitutes later on.

    Non-plastic prices to fall as use increases: minister

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Environment chief Tse Chin-wan (right) also said authorities must find reliable alternatives before expanding a ban on single-use plastics.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment chief Tse Chin-wan has stressed that a ban on single-use plastics is not meant to trouble people, saying prices for alternatives will go down further when they become more common.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect on April 22, prohibiting the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse told RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme, which was broadcast on Saturday, that the policy is not intended to make people's lives more difficult but to regulate plastics at source.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those disposable tableware, if you switch to the alternatives, the difference is actually very small, usually one or two cents to a maximum of 50 cents for the whole package. Therefore, it's not very expensive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that as more and more will be used in society, the price will go down further. People's behaviour will drive the development of the alternatives, as well as drive down the price of those alternatives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said authorities must find reliable substitutes before expanding the scope of scheme, as he ruled out imposing a blanket ban on plastic products because their use is too widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not going to ban the use of all plastics at once. That is not possible... We start with those which we already have readily available and mature alternatives," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the postponed municipal solid waste charging scheme, the environment minister said there are proven effects of the policy in Seoul, where the amount to garbage produced was cut by 60 to 70 percent in about five to 10 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government pushed back the implementation of the waste charging to August, while it held trials for the scheme at more than a dozen premises this month.

    Govt lowers Sha Tin Trunk Road estimated cost

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has put forward minor tweaks to the planned construction of a new road in Sha Tin in hopes of cutting the estimated cost of the project by five percent to HK$6.81 billion amid criticism of its hefty price tag.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a revised funding request for the Trunk Road T4, the administration said the changes would not affect the functionality of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In response to concerns currently about the situation of public finances, we tried to reduce the cost of this project as much as possible," the Legco paper wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to win the support of lawmakers so that the project can be carried out in a timely manner and avoid delaying yet again the long-term development of New Territories East and the Northern Metropolis."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities last month withdrew its application to the Legislative Council of more than HK$7.1 billion in funding for the planned T4 project, which connects major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River, as critics questioned whether the scheme is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To cut cost, the government said it will switch to using traditional materials to build noise barriers for the project, which in turn is expected to save HK$120 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will not affect the function of noise barriers. Currently, traditional materials are commonly used in other construction projects," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other changes include scrapping a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reducing the number of elevators at footbridges to further shave off around HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers are set to discuss the revised funding request during a Finance Committee meeting next week.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they had enhanced enforcement to combat traffic violations associated with taxis, tour buses and illegal cabs at renowned tourist sites as part of preparations for the upcoming Labour Day Golden Week holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing near the Peak Tram station in Central, Inspector Lai Cheuk-fung said during the first three months of the year, police had received 23 complaints about taxis, with grievances about over charging commonly cited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai said officers would enhance their enforcement efforts starting from Wednesday this week to May 8.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said police would also strengthen education by introducing "taxi ambassadors" to provide taxi-related information to travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from enforcement, we would like to introduce a multi-agency approach to tackle this problem. Apart from tackling the problem in Hong Kong, we would like to consolidate Hong Kong's place as an international tourist destination. And this is our ultimate goal," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, senior investigator at the Travel Industry Authority, Mark Cheng, said authorities would beef up their manpower to monitor famous tourist spots and border control points, as around 680 mainland tour groups are expected to visit Hong Kong during Golden Week.

    ICAC sees 30 percent jump in property management cases

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750715_1_L_20240426180937.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday said it received 30 percent more complaints relating to the property management sector in 2023, compared to the year before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it received 236 reports, up from 182 in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Corinna Wong, the ICAC’s director of community relations, said many of the reports last year were linked to repairs and maintenance contracts, with allegations that some were awarded through bribery or that they came with exaggerated price tags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other complainants alleged that some property management firms took bribes from jobseekers, or fabricated duty records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said there were 51 such corruption reports in the first quarter of this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said while there may be "rotten apples" in the industry, the increase in complaints does not mean that the sector has become more corrupt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Sometimes after we investigated corruption cases, and they were widely reported by the press, members of the public may become aware of that particular case and then may come forward to report to us similar cases," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the property management sector, after the ICAC operations department discovered several cases last year, there was a slight increase in the corruption cases we received."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft watchdog said it is working with the Property Management Services Authority to offer training for companies and workers to enhance integrity standards across the sector.

  The authority’s vice-chairperson, Eddie Hui, noted that property management workers must now obtain a licence, and that all of them will need to receive training in areas including anti-corruption awareness starting in 2025.

Police arrest 61 in dozens of online drugs cases

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Friday said they arrested 61 people, including five minors, in the past month for allegedly selling drugs online.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the suspects, aged between 14 and 59, are suspected of involvement in 43 cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized 128 kilogrammes of drugs, including cannabis buds, cocaine and magic mushrooms, as well as electronic cigarette pods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hauls were worth about HK$38 million in total, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Charm Yiu-kwong said drug syndicates have created channels and groups on Telegram to sell cannabis products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Syndicates imported a large amount of cannabis oil from overseas countries to Hong Kong. They then processed the cannabis oil and mixed it into chocolates, candies and cookies, and sold them on social media platforms. In terms of appearance, they looked the same as normal products," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Charm added that some electronic cigarette pods have been found to contain etomidate, warning that even a small amount of the controlled drug can cause death.

Man arrested for having firearms without a licence

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The police on Friday said they arrested a man on suspicion of possessing firearms without a licence.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers found 18 guns, 11 knives, and four daggers at a self-storage facility in Sha Tin, and arrested the 67-year-old suspect on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Superintendent Cheung Ting-fung said the man had previously held licences for various types of guns, but these were revoked in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said it is suspected that all the firearms found at the storage facility this week were obtained illegally from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the case was not related to the social unrest in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, we do not have any evidence showing that the arrested person is connected to any previous riot or violent cases. We tend to believe that this arrested person is just a firearms fanatic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case will be heard at the Sha Tin Magistrates’ Courts on Friday afternoon.

 Chief Executive John Lee said cooperation between Hong Kong and Shanghai was entering a new phase as the CE met with the city's mayor for a major conference on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the sixth plenary session of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Co-operation Conference, Lee said the two cities would sign 20 cooperation documents and reach consensus on 65 projects in areas such as innovation technology, industrial development, digital economy and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since the first meeting in 2003, the two cities have been engaging in more frequent exchanges... Hong Kong has become one of the major export markets and also the largest source of foreign investment into Shanghai," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shanghai Mayor Gong Zheng said these exchanges created opportunities and built a win-win situation for the two cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We sincerely hope that the two cities can take the opportunity of signing a new round of cooperation documents to integrate our development strategies comprehensively, create highlights for our cooperation and together push Hong Kong-Shanghai cooperation to a new phase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong Yin Zonghua, Shanghai Vice Mayor Hua Yuan, and Financial Secretary Paul Chan, were among the other leaders and officials at the meeting.

 Heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong on Friday with the Observatory issuing the Amber Rainstorm Warning just after 8.30 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The amber signal means that heavy rain, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour, has fallen and is likely to continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory warned of flooding in some low-lying and poorly-drained areas, while the Labour Department told construction workers and contractors to pay attention to electrical safety in the workplace.

    Trial and error needed for plastic alternatives: CEO

    <![CDATA[<img alt="George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes and it was the same for environmentally-friendly alternatives. Photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750618_1_L_20240426092723.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The CEO of one of the companies, invited by the government to meet the media and introduce their alternatives to plastic disposable tableware, says a period of trial and error is still needed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, George Chen of Ecoinno said not all plastics had the same attributes when it came to heat, strength and storage and it was the same for their environmentally-friendly alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a point I would like to share. We all know humans have been using plastics for the last 30 years, 40 years - we have all experience," he said. "Different plastics are made for different purposes. For example, a plastic container for sandwiches is not the same formulation as a plastic container for oil or soup."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said that with the introduction of new plant-fibre containers and cutlery, consumers and users needed to focus on what alternative products met their needs rather than just focusing on price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Department put on the media event as it launched the Green Tableware Platform to help people and businesses find alternatives to plastic utensils. The online platform provides a list of suppliers for the environmentally-friendly products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Thursday condemned a vote by the European Parliament critical of Hong Kong’s national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said it “strongly opposed the so-called resolution adopted by the European Parliament against Hong Kong, and strongly condemned the Parliament for making baseless allegations about Hong Kong and smearing the Hong Kong National Security Law (NSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said that the SAR had a constitutional duty to safeguard national security, adding that all sovereign states had an inherent right to safeguard their security in accordance with international law and the UN charter. He noted that many other countries had also enacted national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the Parliament has demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards,” the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman noted that both the NSL and the Ordinance clearly specify that rights and freedoms under the Basic Law and international covenants are to be protected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The European Parliament neglected the relevant provisions and lashed out wantonly, fully exposing its malicious intentions," the spokesman added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We must once again emphasise that the Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against external forces that endanger our national security, acting like a sturdier door and a more effective door lock to defend our home,” the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR Government strongly urges the European Parliament to stop smearing and interfering in Hong Kong affairs which are internal affairs of China and ensure that their remarks concerning the NSL and the Ordinance are fair and just, and stop making scaremongering remarks.”

    'Mainland Citybus drivers may affect locals' jobs'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Unionists say they do not wish to resort to taking industrial action. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750543_1_L_20240425190732.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Transport unionists on Thursday spoke out against a decision by Citybus to import 20 drivers from the mainland, saying they are worried that more will come in the future and affect the jobs of local drivers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus said the first five of the 20 approved bus captains who arrive here next month will take a driving test before they’re allowed to start work, adding that they will only work on non-franchised routes, such as services for employees and tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the Motor Transport Workers General Union said it is worried that this is just the beginning, and that Citybus will bring in more non-local workers to operate on franchised routes down the line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Michael Luk, meanwhile, noted that the hourly salary of a mainland bus captain is slightly lower than that of a local, and expressed worries that local drivers may get a pay cut in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung Nuen-yui from the union's Citybus section said the company should offer better remuneration packages for local recruits before importing drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are new recruits, but not many of them stay in the company. This shows that there are issues with the pay, welfare, shift arrangements, working location and hours. I hope the company will solve these problems before looking into other solutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group added that it is arranging a meeting with Citybus and the authorities, and it does not wish to resort to taking industrial action.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citybus, for its part, said it prioritises local workers and offers a bonus exclusively to new local employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Transport Department also said in response that it has taken into account the welfare of local drivers before allowing Citybus to import drivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said the bus operator has proven that it was not able to hire suitable local drivers, adding that these imported drivers are not allowed to run franchised routes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Immigration officials on Thursday said they expect Lo Wu will be the busiest border crossing during the mainland's "Golden Week" holiday next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Chief Executive John Lee projected almost six million arrivals and departures for the week, with some 800,000 mainland tourists expected to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said Labour Day on May 1 is tipped to be the busiest day, with arrivals and departures reaching one million at land checkpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that between April 30 and May 5, an average of around 200,000 rail journeys a day are expected through Lo Wu, and 170,000 via Lok Ma Chau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An average of 130,000 journeys a day are expected for the bridge to Zhuhai and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department's boundary division commander, Ng Hoi-ka, said travellers are advised to use the department's mobile app for real-time border traffic information, so they can see how busy the different checkpoints are.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on travellers to avoid crossing the border during peak hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all travellers cross the border during the peak hours at the same time, there's bound to be some congestion and longer waiting times. So we urge everyone, if you can, please avoid the peak hours," she said at a press briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Generally speaking, for departures, it starts getting crowded from eight in the morning, and it'd be the busiest between 10 and 12 o'clock."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that her department has prepared for the busy week by curbing holidays for frontline officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A control centre will be set up along with other departments to monitor checkpoint operations, so officers can respond to any emergencies.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Thursday said they arrested two former directors of an online household product store on suspicion of failing to supply pre-paid products to customers, a breach of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials said they had received 451 complaints against the company as of 8am on Thursday, and the complainants had made prepaid orders to the company, involving around HK$400,000 worth of household goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the customers didn't receive the products - or refunds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The online shop shut down earlier this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs officials said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 38, on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released on bail and officers did not rule out the possibility of making more arrests.

    Non-plastic utensil firms show off their products

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Companies supplying alternatives to plastic cutlery on Thursday demonstrated how their products fare, with one showing how to put its straw into a sealed drink and another attempting to cut a steak with its knife and fork.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department has launched an online platform to help people and businesses find suppliers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The platform invited four suppliers to demonstrate their products to the press. One of them, Ecoinno, poured boiling water inside a container to prove it can tolerate high temperatures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its CEO, George Chen, said business has gone up by 70 percent since the disposable utensil ban took effect on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So rules and regulations are extremely important, and we believe the windows are here. So it depends on when customers want to pick things up. It's no more to replace,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The new product will allow [restaurants] to stay away from just price competition because [the non-plastic products] are sustainable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen said his containers contain leak-proof materials and are 10 percent more expensive than other plastic alternatives on the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said despite this, many hotels, hospitals and schools have been placing orders because they like the high quality.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “What are the values that they can get on it besides turnover? So this is what we are talking about. Can it, for example, be reheated? You see.. after [being heated] by 100 degrees water, it stays exactly the way that it is,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier, Supply Ching Company, demonstrated how to scoop up a portion of sticky rice with its spoon. Its founder, Alvis Yip, said his company will advise restaurants how to pick between the two types of spoon it offers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have two kinds of spoon in the market now. We have the rice spoon and the soup spoon. The rice spoon is specially designed for rice because it has a straight lined design. So the [spoons] can go directly into the rice, but the soup spoon is actually designed for just holding the soup and the noodles. So to use it as a rice spoon, it will be a bit soft and weak,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Usually when the restaurant approaches us, we will gather the information of what kind of product they sell. So we will suggest the suitable cutlery for them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak. The fork snapped during two attempts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The supplier explained that the forks are designed with detachable handles, saying this makes them weaker and more prone to breakage once the handles have been detached multiple times.

    'Anti-migrant sentiment pushes domestic workers away'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Sringatin, second left, says foreign domestic workers are looking at destinations other than Hong Kong for work. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750478_1_L_20240425125635.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Migrant domestic worker activists have called for a stop to people who accuse workers of prematurely terminating their contracts to change employers, saying anti-migrant sentiment in Hong Kong would discourage them from staying in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sringatin, who chairs the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union, on Thursday said foreign domestic workers preferred destinations other than the SAR because of better conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is not the only place for domestic workers to find a job. There is also competition between Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, Malaysia and other countries... If Hong Kong continues [to have] more restrictions on domestic workers, I think many people will leave Hong Kong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please stop [job-hopping] accusations, please stop doing anti-migrant policies, because it's not only stopping migrants from coming to Hong Kong, but it also makes the image of Hong Kong become very bad."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiela Tebia, the chairperson of Gabriela Hong Kong, said foreign domestic workers had been singled out for changing employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If [workers] are not content with their working conditions in the company, they can easily send a resignation letter and find another job that gives them a better working conditions," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why does it become an issue when domestic workers want to have a better working condition? Why is the migrant workers community criminalised because of wanting to change employers?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun earlier said a revised code of practice for employment agencies, aimed at deterring foreign domestic workers from changing employers mid-contract, would be promulgated in the second quarter of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the planned changes, firms would be asked to explain clearly to helpers on requirements to change employers and employment agencies would be banned from providing monetary incentives for workers to quit early.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the Immigration Department refused about 500 employment visa applications from foreign domestic workers for suspected job-hopping.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said some high-speed rail services to and from the mainland were cancelled on Thursday due to bad weather conditions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Trains G6527, G6515, G6529, G6535, G6528, G6516, G6530 and G6536 to Guangzhounan (Guangzhou South) were cancelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the destination of train G6510 and the departure station for train G6511 were changed to Shenzhenbei (Shenzhen North) instead of Guangzhounan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said people could consider using alternative transport to get to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Meteorological Centre said it expects heavy rain to continue to hit Guangdong.

    Plastic packaging ok for now: environment bureau

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau clarified that shops could still use plastic containers to pack takeaway food, after a supermarket chain was found using paper food boxes to pack sushi, much to the irritation of some customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A photo went viral online, showing Japanese discount retailer DON DON DONKI using non-plastic, non-transparent containers to pack sushi, with netizens describing that as "sushi in blind boxes".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Reaching out through its “Big Waster” social media account, the bureau said using plastic packaging was still ok for now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This situation is the same with takeaways, so supermarkets can still use plastic boxes and lids to pack takeout sushi. Of course, they can also use transparent boxes, so customers can clearly distinguish the food quality and types," it wrote on social media.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) also reassured people that purchasing or using disposable plastics will not lead to any legal violations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the EPD clarified that eating inside a food court in a shopping mall or a department store is considered as dine-in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it stressed that the plastic ban does not apply to pre-packaged food products displayed on shelves in food courts, because these products can be seen as takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the plastic cutlery ban began on Monday, and restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils, but plastic containers are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The second phase of the ban is expected to begin in 2025, when plastic containers will also be banned for takeaways.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say the driver of a school bus died after he accidentally fell from the vehicle, which then rolled over him in Diamond Hill on Wednesday, while in a separate incident a driver was killed in Lau Fau Shan when his truck slid down a slope, trapping him.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers say the 47-year-old bus driver was preparing to leave the car park of a housing estate on Hammer Hill Road not long after 4pm when the accident happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man suffered multiple injuries but was conscious when he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He later lost consciousness  where he was declared dead just after 9.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 6.30pm, police were called to Lau Fau Shan to reports that a man was trapped between a medium-sized truck and some water tanks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers say that initial investigations show that the man had parked the truck, which was linked to a container trailer and the water tanks, on a slope near Fung Kong Tsuen Road. After he got out, police believe the truck rolled backwards, leaving him trapped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were able to release the 67-year-old driver but he was declared dead at the scene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kowloon East police are looking into the Diamond Hill incident while officers in New Territories North are checking on the Lau Fau Shan case.

    HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn

HK buyer snaps up 'lost' Klimt for US$32mn
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750420_1_L_20240425014336.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Gustav Klimt's "Portrait of Miss Lieser", a painting of a young woman left unfinished when the Austrian artist died, was bought by a Hong Kong buyer at auction on Wednesday for 30 million euros (US$32 million) despite open questions about its subject and previous ownership.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The work was long thought to have been lost when in fact it was hanging in a private villa near Vienna for decades, according to the auction house Im Kinsky that put it on display in January before putting it under the hammer. Im Kinsky had estimated its value at 30 million to 50 million euros.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auction house confirmed the buyer was in Hong Kong and was represented by Patti Wong & Associates, but did not identify the buyer. The AFP news agency said the painting was sold to the SAR's HomeArt gallery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It shows its likely teenage subject in a turquoise dress draped in a flowing floral gown against a red background, her alabaster skin and piercing, pale brown eyes contrasting with her dark, curly hair.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite depicting her so clearly, it remains unclear who "Fraeulein Lieser" actually was. The brothers Adolf and Justus Lieser were wealthy industrialists in the Austro-Hungarian empire, having built their wealth on jute and hemp, making twine and rope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henriette Amalie Lieser-Landau, nicknamed "Lilly", was married to Justus until their divorce in 1905 and became a well-known patron of the arts. It is possible she commissioned the painting of one of her daughters, or Adolf Lieser could have done so with his daughter Margarethe as the subject.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to the latest provenance research, Klimt's model was possibly not Margarethe Constance Lieser, Lilly Lieser's niece, but one of her two daughters (with Justus), either Helene, the older one, born in 1898, or her sister Annie, who was three years younger," the auction house said on its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the painting after Klimt's death in 1918, when it would have been in his studio, remains unclear, particularly what happened after Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 and the country's Jews were persecuted, expropriated and sent to concentration camps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was these many ambiguities and historical gaps that prompted the current owners to contact the legal successors of the Lieser family and to agree on a 'fair and just solution' with them all in 2023," Im Kinsky said, without identifying the current owners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been agreed not to disclose the contents of the said agreement; however, it can be stated that all conceivable claims of all parties involved will be settled and fulfilled through the auctioning of the artwork," it said. (Reuters/AFP)

    'Productivity and quality key to HK's competitiveness'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Mohamed Butt (right) says unleashing new quality productive forces can help attract more businesses to the SAR. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750376_1_L_20240425002313.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday met the Secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee, Meng Fanli, to exchange views on furthering cooperation between the two cities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government said the two leaders also talked about promoting high-quality development in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said Hong Kong and Shenzhen had set up various working groups to promote collaboration in key areas including the Northern Metropolis, and the innovation and technology sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park, which is located in the Lok Ma Chau Loop, would start to operate soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said Hong Kong would continue to build on its advantages to lead the development of the Greater Bay Area, as well as work with Shenzhen to contribute to the country's development.

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Audit Commission says rehabus operators should review their routes and improve patronage. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750361_1_L_20240424164335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says a mental health hotline has offered help to some 30,000 callers since its launch last December. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750346_1_L_20240424152230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'

Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750343_1_L_20240424153905.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials were forced to take action to restore public confidence in the 'smart toilet' after a user became trapped inside. Photo courtesy of Countryside Conservation Office." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750327_1_L_20240424133030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Wednesday began a three-day debate on the financial secretary's budget blueprint, with many of them praising Paul Chan's efforts to boost the economy despite a deficit of more than HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various lawmakers lauded Chan for responding to their demands, such as removing all property-cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said the financial secretary offered much support to the people and various business sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The budget actively promotes the comprehensive development of our economy. There are measures to support the SMEs in tapping foreign markets. There's also support for IT development. It will build a Hong Kong brand comprehensively," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB chair also said it's high time Hong Kong reviewed comprehensively its advantages and complemented other cities in the Greater Bay Area, so that the region can enjoy development synergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Business and Professionals Alliance chairman Lo Wai-kwok described Paul Chan as a "master chef" who came up with "popular and healthy dishes" despite the budget shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The secretary has been tightening the purse strings while rolling out a series of measures to stimulate the economy so as to make sure government initiatives would be popular. It's not an easy task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, meanwhile, said officials should look into widening Hong Kong's tax base as soon as possible, noting the public coffers would be hit particularly hard during economic downturns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vote on the budget is scheduled to take place in two weeks.

    Hongkong Post urged to boost e-commerce revenues

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hongkong Post says many unforeseen developments have impacted its ability to achieve the budgeted revenues. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750323_1_L_20240424130708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday urged Hongkong Post to explore measures to boost its revenue in e-commerce services, after the postal department suffered losses from operations in seven of the past 10 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A report by the auditor noted that Hongkong Post also failed to meet the target rates of return on fixed assets for nine years in the past decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022-23, the postal department recorded a loss from operations of HK$305 million and a rate of return on fixed assets of negative 13 percent – far from the 1.5 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audit officials said local e-commerce services, which were intended to offset loss-making traditional mail services, did not perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that the profitability was negative each year throughout the previous five-year period with the deficit being around three-fold of the revenue each year, while Hongkong Post could not attain the budgeted revenue from local e-commerce services for each of the three years in the period from 2020-21 to 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Hongkong Post] needs to continue efforts in increasing the revenue and the mail volume of local e-commerce services, and explore effective measures to improve the profitability of local e-commerce services," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor cites Hongkong Post as saying it sets an aggressive target for budgeted revenues to motivate staff to maximise revenue generation. However, in the ever-changing business environment, there are many unforeseen developments, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic, which significantly impacted on [Hongkong Post's] ability to achieve the budgeted revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor also conducted a check on Hongkong Post's website and found that cross-border postal services for regions in mainland China were incorrectly listed as "international services".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postal department has since revised such descriptions to "other destinations", according to the commission's report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate examination by the commission showed that service agreements between Hongkong Post and stamp designers lacked specific clauses concerning safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Postmaster General said Hongkong Post attaches great importance to national security and will incorporate such clauses.

    Emergency appointments halved amid dentist shortage

Emergency appointments halved amid dentist shortage
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1750317_1_L_20240424123001.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of emergency dental appointment slots at government clinics has fallen by almost half since the pandemic, the Audit Commission said on Wednesday, as it called for improvements to services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a report, the government auditor said there was an annual quota of around 40,000 appointment slots at the city’s 11 public dental clinics in the year 2018/19, but this had fallen to about 20,000 by 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It cited the Department of Health as saying the reduction was due to the pandemic, but also a shortage of dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said it found instances of people queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment the following day under the first-come-first served system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic, people who had pre-registered to see the dentist still had to arrive in the morning to pick up a disc for an appointment that wasn’t until the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor noted that the government is aware of the public demand for more appointment slots for emergency dental care and urged it to address the manpower shortage and bring the quota back up to at least the level before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the public spending watchdog said health officials should beef up support for NGOs involved in the Outreach Dental Care Programme, which provides free dental services to elderly people in care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the attendance rate for the programme needs to be improved, noting that the target of 43,000 service users was not met from 2020/21 to 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two NGOs served less than half the number of people they aimed to for three consecutive years, the auditor added.

    'Precautions also apply to sites near manholes'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A construction union group's safety adviser says people working near manholes can also be exposed to a high concentration of gas. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750303_1_L_20240424112457.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Safety measures for working in confined spaces also apply to sites connected to manholes, a construction group said on Wednesday, following the deaths this week of two sewer maintenance workers who were suspected to have been exposed to toxic gas in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the pair, who are thought to have inhaled hydrogen sulfide, were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee Kwong-sing, a safety adviser with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said people working near a manhole could also be exposed to a high concentration of gas when the cover is opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [hazardous] gas is concentrated enough, people near the manhole may have a chance of inhaling a high concentration of toxic gas... and possibly faint and fall into the manhole," Lee told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said current regulations stipulate that precautions are required for people working in a confined space and also in the vicinity of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, workers were using high-pressure water jets near the manhole," Lee said. "So one can't say because workers are not going into the manhole, there is no need for precautionary measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing said the government needs to tighten up guidelines for people working in confined spaces, including more stringent tests on hazardous gases and mandatory video monitoring of workers inside manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Tuesday evening said a revised code on working in confined spaces would be ready in one to two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, agreed with suggestions that construction companies should notify authorities before work starts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those small-scale construction works, related to high-risk tasks such as [working in] confined spaces and manholes, you also need to report and notify the Labour Department," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, contractors are not required to submit project reports to labour officials in advance if such work will involve at most 10 workers and will be completed within six weeks.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is aiming to roll out a scheme in the third quarter of the year to encourage people to rejoin the workforce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme announced in his policy address in 2023, elderly and middle-aged people who have not been in paid employment for three consecutive months or more will be entitled to an allowance after working for at least six straight months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Trade Unions marking the upcoming Labour Day, Lee also said the government will fine-tune the review mechanism of the city's minimum wage, as part of measures to better protect the rights of employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hailed their contributions to the city’s economic and social development, noting that authorities are going all out to stimulate the economy while improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This year's Labour Day is the first Labour Day in the SAR after the enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law... We can [now] spare no effort to fight for the city’s economic growth, pursue development, improve people's livelihoods, and have all wage earners pursue happiness in a safe and stable environment,” he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it strongly opposed and disapproved of a report by the United States on the human rights situation in Hong Kong last year, calling it "unfounded and biased".
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman of the SAR government said it condemned repeated US attempts to politicise human rights in the so-called annual human rights report by the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR government strongly demands that the US immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs," the spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration is against the wanton slander on Hong Kong where the One Country, Two Systems principle is successfully implemented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that the SAR's laws on national security clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected.

    Legco expansion to be completed by year's end

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Tuesday said the expanded Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty was expected to come into operation at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Four storeys are being added to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, several government officials, and Leung attended the "topping out" ceremony at Legco and visited the newly built 12th floor, marking a milestone in progress on the expansion of the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he hopes Legco members can move into the building by the end of the year so that they can work under the same roof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Wendy Hong, who is one of dozens of members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as their temporary office, said it would be more convenient when they moved back to Legco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look forward to move back soon because now we have meetings in the Legco building, but our office is in another building," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes it's difficult for us to arrange [meeting] times. When you have 20, 15 minutes in between two meetings, it's difficult for you to go back to the office and come back [to Legco] again. But now we can go back to office and come back. It's easier to arrange time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the new floors began in 2022, with the project costing around HK$400 million more than the original estimate, from HK$1.17 billion to HK$1.56 billion.

    First trial under UN anti-terrorism law gets underway

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance got underway at the High Court on Tuesday, over an alleged attempt to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Lai Chun-pong and Justin Hui deny "conspiracy to commit bombing of prescribed objects", while Lau Pui-ying has pleaded not guilty to a conspiracy charge relating to providing or collecting property to commit terrorist acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the court that the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019 – one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first bomb was designed to make police move to where the second was planted, the prosecution said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the second bomb was bigger, with a power radius of 400 metres, and it contained 150 iron nails which would have caused serious casualties and property damage had it been detonated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defendants also planned to shoot police officers, the court was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the nine-person jury that Cheung Ming-yu, Hui and Lai received military training in Taiwan in September 2019, and that the trio also went up a hill in Sai Kung to test their guns three weeks before the day of the planned attack, which police say they foiled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution's witnesses for the trial include a co-defendant who pleaded guilty, Wong Chun-keung, who is said to have been the leader of the group behind the alleged bomb plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong authorities have brought a prosecution using the anti-terrorism ordinance since it was enacted in July 2002.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government's office for attracting skilled workers to the city will host a global talent summit and expo at the Exhibition and Convention Centre in Wan Chai between May 7 and 8, to encourage more people to move to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Director of Hong Kong Talent Engage, Anthony Lau, on Tuesday said nearly 100 firms, public bodies and government departments were expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20 people will share their outlooks on the global job market and talent movement trends, as well as opportunities and exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said admission is free, and locals can also take part. The event will be broadcast live online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his office would provide information on different talent entry schemes, as well as support services for non-locals on how they can move to Hong Kong, offering advice on issues such as housing and education for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau noted that in the past year, finance and IT were among the sectors that attracted the most non-local talent to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For talent coming to Hong Kong, most of them are very interested in tips on every-day life. They also want more opportunities to learn Cantonese and practice the language," Lau told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said with Cantonese classes being so popular, his office would hold dozens more of them this year.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday dismissed the need for legislation against "fake news", stressing the media sector's ability to improve credibility through professionalism and self-discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee acknowledged improvements in the dissemination of accurate information and praised the efforts of journalists' groups to combat misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the media industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of news reporting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will monitor the situation but my take is that if this problem can be addressed by enhancing professionalism, then it should be our first choice. We need to work together. There is no need for legislation. I always think that we can handle this issue with self-discipline as well as professionalism," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's remarks came after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the SCMP in an interview that the government has ruled out introducing a fake news law, an idea proposed by the previous administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said legislation in this area would be challenging due to complex legal issues surrounding the definition of fake news.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's chief executive Siu Sin-man said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The system can effectively strengthen the contractors' vigilance because they need to provide many supporting [documents] to the Labour Department to show they have done the best preparations including safety precautions," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Labour Department knows more about the ongoing projects, there can be better monitoring."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.

 The Transport Department said Peak Tram services remain suspended after several trees collapsed near the tracks amid heavy wind on Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus route 15C, which connects the tram terminal to the Central ferry piers, is also suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department urged people to use other forms of public transport, adding that work is continuing to clear the area.
  <br/>

    Workers not supposed to enter manhole: minister

Workers not supposed to enter manhole: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said it had suspended the contractors from tendering for public works related to roads and drainage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. The contractors are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures," a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the suspension would only be lifted if the contractors demonstrated an effective safety management system.

Preparations are in place for Golden Week: John Lee

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The TLB (Transport and Logistics Bureau) and the Transport Department have already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be good and smooth service for visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched after two sewer maintenance workers died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities say early indications are that the pair, and two other men who also fell ill while working in the manhole, inhaled hydrogen sulfide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said the men were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were called at around midnight to reports that the workers had fallen ill while operating three to four metres underground at the Yuen Wo Playground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men are said to be 26 and 34 years old. They were declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The two other workers were also treated at the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had ordered a halt to work at the site and paused all similar work elsewhere until it could conduct safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s also launched an investigation and promised to work with the Labour Department and the police, who are also looking into the case. It's been classified as an industrial accident.

    HK to launch climate disclosure roadmap this year

HK to launch climate disclosure roadmap this year

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong is on track to becoming one of the first jurisdictions to adopt sustainability disclosure requirements in line with global standards, as the government vowed to do more to support green energy transition in the region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a forum to mark Earth Day, the finance chief said the government is committed to launching a roadmap this year to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will soon release a local green classification framework that aligns with rules adopted by the European Union and the mainland to combat so-called “green washing”, the act of providing misleading information about products’ environmental benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan noted the SAR could do more to support green transition finance in the region, which would involve investing in green sectors and projects, as well as assisting carbon-intensive industries in their net-zero transformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have the expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory framework that support international investors and different transition projects,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There’s clear room to explore how Hong Kong could better help channel capital to support the transition of high-emitting sectors and heavy polluting industries in the region,” he added.

    Environmental survey for new tech hub plan approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Advisory Council on the Environment has listed eight conditions, after it approved the environmental impact assessment for the San Tin Technopole project. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750021_1_L_20240422193418.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advisory council on Monday conditionally approved the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the San Tin Technopole project, despite heavy criticism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Green groups had last week called the report the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Advisory Council on the Environment approved the EIA at a meeting, but it listed eight conditions, including the submission of a habitat creation and management plan (HCMP) to the Environmental Protection Department nine months before pond filling works begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other conditions included setting up wildlife corridors with a diameter of at least ten metres wide, submitting a plan on enhancing wetlands in Mai Po, and setting up an environmental committee to monitor the implementation of ecological mitigation measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Terence Tsang, the department's assistant director, said authorities will ensure the eight conditions will be met throughout the development of the tech hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a very stringent mechanism to review that submission. Also, if in case the effectiveness of the measures recommended in the HCMP was found to not achieve the expected results... there is some kind of monitoring mechanism," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green groups said the EIA had missed two species of breeding birds and also did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills counted in the survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, they said that the assessment had violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted crucial data points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also said the report should be resubmitted, as the area for the San Tin Technopole project had been expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But council chairman John Chai said that that would not be necessary as the assessment already covered issues like ecology, fishponds and wetlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite that there is a difference in the area, the coverage of the development, the environmental issues that need to be studied have not changed... So in other words, it's the same kind of study," Chai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the development, environmental groups said they were highly disappointed by the decision, stressing that the San Tin Technopole project will cause irreversible damage to wetlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, they said the conditions laid out by the department did not specifically address the deficiencies in the San Tin EIA report, which they regarded as "invalid, incomplete, unscientific, and unreliable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction work for the tech hub will begin late this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 It is “widely known medical knowledge” that hepatitis B patients taking steroids should also be prescribed antivirals, a renal specialist told the Coroner’s Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lui Sing-leung, who chairs the Hospital Authority’s central renal committee, also said a doctor who treated liver disease patient Tang Kwai-sze should have detailed the discussions on the use of steroids during a consultation session in his medical notes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had been taking steroids to treat her chronic kidney disease before she underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giving evidence on Monday, Lui said while the Hospital Authority had yet to issue a guideline on antiviral prescription for non-cancer patients at the time of Tang’s steroid treatment, it was “widely known” that such drugs should be given to the patient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told the inquest, before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury, that Lam’s notes only said the patient was briefed on the “pros and cons of steroids” and agreed to using the drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Lam should have written down clearly the pros and cons of steroids that he had highlighted, because [relapse] is an important, serious potential complication,” Lui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui added that doctors who see the same patient subsequently might only rely on the previous medical notes, but not the hospital’s clinical management system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, the other doctor who later saw Tang, did not follow up with the patient as to why antivirals had not been prescribed when he should have, the court heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another expert witness, Professor Grace Wong from the Chinese University’s medical school, agreed that a hepatitis B flare-up, in which the level of liver enzymes rises abruptly, is mainly caused by the absence of antivirals during a high-dose steroid treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology and hepatology, said a study she’s part of found that even short courses of a large dosage of steroids could increase the risk of a hepatitis flare-up, and such patients should receive antivirals regardless of the duration of the treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said while it should be “common sense” to prescribe antivirals along with steroids, the practice was not written “in black and white” before the patient’s case came to light, so one could not expect all doctors to follow as such.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inquest hearing continues.

    Plastic ban gets support but 'more can be done'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Plastic food containers are still allowed for takeaway orders under the new policy. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749984_1_L_20240422154854.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People were generally supportive of the plastic cutlery ban that took effect on Monday, but some said it was inconvenient and restaurants could do more to protect the environment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, but plastic containers and cups are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lamini, an office worker in Wan Chai, said cutting down on plastic products is the right thing to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By removing plastic one by one, I think it can only be positive for our children and future generations. I agree to pay maybe a little bit more to have something made from paper and I think we have to do it now,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevaeh, a student enjoying a drink at a cafe in Admiralty, said she did not mind using a paper straw, even though it became soft after a while.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I got used to it because they only provide paper straws, so you’ll just accept it,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Luk, a worker, said paper straws just do not work and restaurants should switch to reusable ones, like stainless steel straws, for dine-in customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They should have thought it through and tested the straw first,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I could barely drink from the paper straw. I had to take it out and drink from the glass, because it was flattened.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, the director of a steakhouse in Wan Chai, said he understands that eco-friendly cutlery may not be as useful as plastic cutlery and so he is offering his customers different options when ordering takeaway food.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they want plastic tableware it’ll cost them HK$5. Of course people will prefer to dine in if they’re having steak. If they order takeaways they can ask us to slice the steaks for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the owner of a Vietnamese noodle joint said it will switch to paper pulp cutlery in a week or so, when the stock of plastic tableware is used up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said eco-friendly alternatives are more costly and will make it harder for small businesses to stay afloat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It costs around 30 percent more. But the economy is in a tough shape, how can we transfer the cost onto the customers? They may not come if we put up the price,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We chose sturdier paper tableware because we serve soup noodles... and they’re more expensive.”

    New growth charts introduced after 31 years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities on Monday said they are updating how they measure children's growth for the first time since 1993 to reflect the fact that today's young people are typically taller and heavier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New charts are being rolled out to help check how a child's weight, height, body mass index and head circumference compare with those of their peers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Thomas Chung, from the Department of Health, worked with colleagues from Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong. He said there was a clear trend upwards in the height and weight of children and adolescents in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we compare the new charts, HK2020, with that of the old charts, HK1993, the median height of boys and girls at age 18, they are two centimetres taller than those in the median height of the same age in 1993," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There may be many factors like nutrition, and improvements in society, so this is expected and seen in other places in the world as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung also said they compared their current data to data routinely collected by the health department to validate and discover trends, adding the pandemic did not affect their results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected more than 21,000 data from children and adolescents to construct the new Hong Kong 2020 growth references. These growth charts contain nine centile lines, as compared to the seven centile lines in the old charts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two additional extreme lines help frontline professionals have a more accurate and detailed assessment on the growth of the children, so that they can be referred to other specialists if necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Tony Nelson, a paediatrics specialist from Chinese University, said it was important to check local data instead of relying on global studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of our local data showing that infants are lighter at birth and girls are slightly shorter, I think this just reflects the importance of local data," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So our local data shows that for the Hong Kong population, it's not like the WHO study, which was from six countries globally and included countries like the Netherlands, and India, and America, and other places. So I think this just reflects the local genetics, the local population here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health will start using the new growth charts in maternal and child health centres in July, and in student health service centres in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority will implement them in phases starting in September, and aims to have them in all its facilities by the end of the year.

    '70 percent of eateries still using plastic items'

'70 percent of eateries still using plastic items'
" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1749951_1_L_20240422120256.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector leader on Monday said about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 18,000 restaurants are still handing out plastic cutlery, despite the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics coming into effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government says it won't issue fines for breaches of the ban over the next six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said many small and medium-sized restaurants are still using plastic, because it's cheaper than alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong told an RTHK programme that he hopes people will get into the habit of taking their own cutlery with them when they go out for food, so they don't have to pay extra for eco-friendly options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cost may be passed on to some people, because they may have to pay additional fees. However, I hope that people can, in the future, get into the habit of using their own tableware. It would be best if they can bring their own cutlery, as that way neither party needs to consider the matter of cost," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ban also means hotels can no longer provide guests with free plastic items, including disposable razors, toothbrushes and shower caps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Backchat programme, the executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, Caspar Tsui, said the industry is struggling to find alternative products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has been a little difficulty in changing some of the products. Not because we were not willing to do it, but mainly because, you know, it's difficult to find sufficient suppliers and the quality of products that we need to maintain the service," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're adjusting slowly, not because we don't want to, but it takes time."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.

    Workers don't want a Labour Day march, says FTU

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday explained its decision not to hold a march on May 1, saying members don't want one and it has come up with "more effective" channels for workers to express their opinions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group hasn't held its customary Labour Day march since before the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The some 400,000 members and 200 unions gathered on the platform of the FTU to promote labour values and the labour spirit. We are holding a series of activities in the upcoming week simply because that's what workers want. Not holding a march doesn't mean we are avoiding anything," said FTU president and lawmaker Stanley Ng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think those activities are more effective channels to let workers express their opinions," he told reporters at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU chairman and lawmaker Kingsley Wong said as part of its Labour Day campaign, the group has invited senior government officials, including Chief Executive John Lee, Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, to meet frontline workers from various industries to learn about their needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group will also submit proposals on labour matters to the government next week.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Two men have been arrested after several renovation and engineering companies were scammed out of a total of HK$1.5 million, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the companies were given work on what were purported to be school projects and were persuaded to use particular suppliers for materials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms were tricked into believing they had received deposits for the work, via forged screenshots of remittance records or cheques that bounced, before they made payments to the "suppliers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the victims made payments to those fake suppliers, they would lose all communication to the [fraudsters] and suppliers. Then the companies eventually realised they had been scammed,” said Chief Inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 44, in Yuen Long on Friday, on suspicion of obtaining property by deception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam urged companies to check with their banks that their account balances increase following payments from clients, to ensure that the transactions have not been manipulated.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Magic mushrooms, marijuana candy and LSD stamps were among a haul of drugs worth around HK$12 million seized in Yau Tong last week, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided a factory building in the area on April 19 and another the following day, after discovering that the sites were being used for manufacturing and trafficking dangerous drugs destined to be sold in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 25-year-old man was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the operation, our officers seized drugs with a total market value of more than 12 million dollars, including 12.5 kilogrammes of heroin, 8 kilogrammes of marijuana flowers, 270 sticks of marijuana vape juice, 500 millilitres of marijuana oil, marijuana candy and cookies, magic mushrooms and LSD stamps," said Senior Inspector Matthew Fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our officers also examined tools found in one of the units suspected to be used for manufacturing and packaging the drugs. We believe that this operation has successfully cut off the supply chain of this drug trafficking group."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said officers were trying to trace the source of the raw materials used to produce the drugs found.

 Trees came down in several parts of the city, some rail services were disrupted and the observatory reported a waterspout on Sunday, as strong winds and thunderstorms battered Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Peak Tram stopped running after a tree came down on Barker Road, while another fell on Wylie Road in Ho Ma Tin, temporarily blocking traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was disruption to East Rail Line services for around an hour in the afternoon, with emergency maintenance work taking place at University Station after the wind apparently ripped away part of the canopy above one of the platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said some high-speed train services between Hong Kong and the mainland would be delayed due to the bad weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, speed limits on the bridge to Macau and Zhuhai were reduced due to the high winds, the Transport Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued at 10am and while it was cancelled at 1.45pm, a thunderstorm warning remained in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said intense gusts reaching 80 kilometres per hour or above could continue to affect the territory, as it also warned of possible flooding from rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At around 9.30 in the morning, a waterspout was spotted in Clear Water Bay, the observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that more thundery showers are forecast throughout the rest of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, authorities in Guangdong warned of the risk of floods from rivers, waterways and reservoirs after days of torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in localities and municipalities across the province were told to begin emergency planning to avert any disasters.
