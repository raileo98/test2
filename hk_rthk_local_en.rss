<div class="itemFullText">
 Patients will be able to pick up their medications at community pharmacies from next week, the Hospital Authority (HA) has announced.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The HA launched a medication delivery service last year, allowing patients to receive their medications at home or at the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it will expand this service and allow patients to collect their medications at over 100 community pharmacies, under Mannings and Watsons, from September 10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  William Chui, chief pharmacist with the HA, said it would provide one more option for patients, and they will be able to receive professional help as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have the professional, the community pharmacists, provide counselling and also drug information to patients who want more information about their medication or drug treatment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So [it's] not only for the delivery of the drugs, but also providing immediate service or professional service to the patient."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui said the HA would look into expanding the scope to cover more pharmacies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the HA also aims to encourage Hong Kong residents to make use of primary healthcare services to reduce the workload on public hospitals and clinics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Pharmacists in the community provide information, and also professional advice on how to prevent disease, how to improve patients' health overall. I think this is a good start to let our patients make use of healthcare professionals in the community," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 One in five teenagers exhibited symptoms of depression or anxiety, according to a survey released on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Baptist Oi Kwan Social Service, an NGO providing mental health support and counselling, interviewed 1,646 secondary pupils between last November and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 25 percent of the respondents even displayed "medium" to "severe" levels of depression. When asked to self-evaluate, many said they felt useless, had nothing to look forward to or hated their lives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 37 percent of them also expressed dissatisfaction with their academic performance, while one in four felt distressed about their appearance and body shape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The situation is "concerning", according to Scarlet Poon Fung Oi, the group's assistant chief executive officer who reported the findings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That said, she believed the existing three-tier school-based emergency system is effective in identifying pupils with suicidal risks or high mental health needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government introduced the scheme in December last year with an aim to offer timely assistance to students going through mental health issues. The response came after multiple teenagers took their own lives in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Clinical psychologist Jeff Kei advised teenagers to proactively seek help when needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes we tend to avoid or even suppress our emotions. This may help us navigate the world when we are stressed but in the long run, actually it may lead to more emotional problems," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think the first thing teenagers can do is to recognise and acknowledge their feelings. There are many online services or resources that can help them enhance their emotional well-being. So, don't hesitate to look for these resources."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the new school year begins on Monday, Kei also called on teachers and parents to offer additional support to pupils grappling with mental health issues.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Sunday that preparations are underway at the Kai Tak Sports Park for a grand opening ceremony in the first quarter of next year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his social media page, Lee said he and a number of his top officials inspected the sports park last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the main structure of the public sports ground, indoor sports centre and main stadium are almost complete, while the interior decoration and landscaping construction are still in progress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the inspection, I asked the working group to ensure that the Kai Tak Sports Park is successfully completed and opened as scheduled to consolidate Hong Kong’s strategic positioning as a city of major events. At the same time, I reminded staff to pay attention to implementation details, strengthen adaptability and ensure smooth operations after the park is completed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Kai Tak Sports Park will conduct different drills and trial opening activities before its official opening to allow for adjustments… it will also adjust strategies as needed to improve response efficiency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to a video posted on the CE’s social media page, the main stadium will have about eight floors, with a seating capacity of 50,000. There will also be 28 concession stands and five bars, with one being amongst the longest in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said many local sports stars and artists are slated to attend the grand opening ceremony next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said he hopes that the new, state-of-the-art venue will not only drive sports development, but also generate substantial economic benefits to Hong Kong by stimulating the growth of the performing arts, tourism and other sectors.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong has what it takes to be a regional processing hub for Australian exports, ahead of his five-day duty visit down under.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The financial chief departed for Sydney on Sunday. He will also visit Melbourne before returning to the SAR on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In his weekly blog, Chan said he hopes to achieve three objectives in his latest trip, with luring investment being top of his agenda.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the highlights of this visit is to meet enterprises in the fields of biomedicine, new energy and fintech, and I will promote Hong Kong's strategic advantages and hopefully get them to set up shop in the SAR," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Similarly, Chan also hoped to strengthen cooperation in green technology, citing his goal to develop Hong Kong into a "green finance centre" under this year's Budget.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also noted that Hong Kong imported HK$14.8 billion worth of Australian goods last year, including fresh produce, seafood and wine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Australia is now the city's second-largest source of imported wine by value, and the largest by volume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong's highly interconnected and accessible air freight network, well-developed storage facilities and efficient customs clearance have made it a cost-effective transshipment hub for high-value goods," Chan explained, adding there is potential to further boost trade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from meeting local business leaders, Chan will also attend an Asia Summit organised by the Australian Financial Review, and deliver a keynote speech.

    HK needs to beef up tech investment: Sun Dong

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong still has a long way to go before it can become a Silicon-Valley-style international technology hub, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Sun said the SAR has rolled out measures to boost the sector over the past two years, noting that the target of attracting 100 I&T enterprises to the territory within five years has been achieved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said there’s room to further boost investment in cutting-edge technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Hong Kong] government is investing more money on frontier technologies. Last year, it spent 1.07 percent of GDP on this, which is a record for Hong Kong. However, this is still low compared to nearby regions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, the mainland spends 2.7 to 2.8 percent of its GDP on research and technology. Cities like Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai spend even more, over 5 percent of their GDP."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun added that the government needs to consider how to make the most out of its investments given the current financial climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tech chief also highlighted the need for the SAR to enhance its role as a super connector and super value-adder to lure more global talent.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities said people who're caught feeding wild pigeons will no longer get any verbal warning and will instead face immediate, on-the-spot fines of HK$5,000.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said pigeon feeders will face instant enforcement measures, after an amendment to Hong Kong's wildlife protection law came into effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Amendment Ordinance has already been in effect for a month," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Enforcement officers will take immediate enforcement action without prior verbal warnings upon discovering any person who is found to be illegally feeding wild animals or feral pigeons."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the changes approved by the Legislative Council in May, the maximum penalty for feeding wild animals has also been raised to a one-year prison term and a fine of HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The AFCD noted that officers will step up patrols across the territory, and work closely with other department to conduct joint enforcement operations.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     "She's an old rival of mine. We used to be neck and neck with each other. So my tactic was just to roll every ball well, give full play to my skills, and don't think too much," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong, China's badminton and boccia players closed in on medals at the Paris Paralympics late on Saturday, though two swimming finalists missed out.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In badminton, Daniel Chan, a bronze medalist in Tokyo, will take on South Korea's Yu Sooyoung in the semi-final of the men's WH2 on Sunday after comfortably topping his group by beating rivals from Chile and Malaysia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chu Man-kai, the top seed in the men's SH6 competition after taking silver in Tokyo, won all three pool games to earn himself a bye through the quarter-finals. He beat opponents from Britain, India and Indonesia to top Group A, and will go again in tonight's semi-finals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two women's boccia players also secured semi-final places in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After topping her group in the women's individual BC4, Annie Cheung took control of her quarter-final, beating Laissa Polyana Teixeira of Brazil 4-1. Cheung is at her first Paralympics and next takes on  Malaysia's Noor Askuzaimey Mat Salim in the semi-final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Yuen-kei had to come from behind to win her BC3 quarter-final against Kla-Han Ladamanee of Thailand, scoring twice in the final end to seal a 3-2 victory. She next faces Kang Sunhee for a place in the final on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmers Tang Wai-lok and Andy Cheung missed out in the final of the men's  S14 200m freestyle, as Britain's William Ellard smashed the world record to take gold.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who won gold in the same event in the Rio 2016 Games, finished seventh while Cheung, who is making his Paralympic debut at the age of 19, finished eighth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ellard dominated from start to finish, taking more than a second off the record with a time of 1min 51.30 seconds. Nicholas Bennett of Canada and Australia's Jack Ireland took silver and bronze respectively.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's Chan Yui-lam and Cheung Ho-ying bowed out in the semi-finals of the equivalent women's event. The S14 category is for swimmers with intellectual disabilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang will be back in action in the S14 100m backstroke and the SM14 200m medley.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's sole para athletics representative, Yam Kwok-fan, missed out on a place in the final of the women's T36 200 metres, finishing fifth in her heat. She's got the 100m coming up later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere in boccia, Hong Kong's Leung Yuk-wing saw his campaign end at the quarter-final stage in the men's individual BC4 event. After finishing second in his group, he was beaten 6-1 by Britain's Stephen McGuire in the early hours of Sunday. He'll be back later in the mixed doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the women's BC2 competition, Yeung Hiu-lam was beaten by Britain's Claire Taggart 3-2 in the quarter-final.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Later on Sunday, John Loung of Hong Kong takes on Huadpradit Witsanu of Thailand in men's BC1 quarter-final.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The national security police said on Saturday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of "doing with a seditious intention an act or acts that had a seditious intention" in relation to a suicide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 41-year-old male suspect had allegedly put memorial light boxes in various places, while a 28-year-old woman is suspected of publishing falsified last words of the deceased.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said the contents provoked hatred towards the central authorities and the SAR government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers holding a court warrant searched the duo's homes in Kowloon and the New Territories yesterday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They seized light boxes, materials for making the boxes and electronic communication devices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrestees were detained for investigation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Cathay flight heading to Hong Kong from Kaohsiung remained grounded just before take-off after one of the aircraft's engines reportedly caught fire.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The airline said the CX431 flight was scheduled to depart at 11.20 am on Saturday, but one of its engines encountered technical problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Online videos showed that the flight was preparing for take off on the tarmac, when the engine suddenly shot out of flames.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A loud bang was heard, and the aircraft later came to a halt on the runway.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline said no passengers or crew were hurt in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Members of the national team on Saturday said their goodbyes to Hong Kong, saying they were delighted to meet the crowds and were surprised by their enthusiastic reactions, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Meeting the press before their departure, weightlifter Li Fabin, who also visited Hong Kong with a delegation three years ago, shared his thoughts on the visit this time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Last time there weren't that many crowds because of the pandemic…This time in Hong Kong, people have been incredibly enthusiastic, something I haven't seen before. The cheers and applause from the Hong Kong residents have deeply touched our hearts and are a strong source of support for us," the two-time Olympic gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also mentioned that he plans to defend his men’s 61 kg title at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving queen Quan Hongchan was asked about her secret to success.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “it's all about staying calm, happy, and not overthinking," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun Yingsha from the table tennis team visited the Hong Kong Sports Institute on Friday. She said she's thrilled to have had the chance to exchange and interact with Hong Kong athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I feel like Hong Kong’s overall table tennis standard has improved a lot. From my visit to the Sports Institute yesterday, whether in terms of training equipment or the logistical support, I think it’s getting better. I hope that we can all work hard together for the common goal of fighting for the country,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Synchronised swimmer Wang Qianyi and her elder twin sister Wang Liuyi will pursue PhD degrees at the Education University of Hong Kong in the coming academic year. She said they were looking forward to studying in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've always wanted to experience the campus atmosphere. We hope to enhance ourselves while enjoying the campus life and experiencing different aspects of life beyond training," Wang Qianyi said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By Saturday afternoon, the delegation left Hong Kong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, headed to Macau for a three-day visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official Facebook, Chief Executive John Lee thanked the delegation for bringing an unforgettable experience to Hongkongers and filling the city with a strong sports atmosphere in the past three days.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Various workers' rights groups on Saturday have submitted a series of proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his third Police Address in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suggestions include calls for standard working hours, higher minimum wage, universal retirement protection, and improved occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the organisations, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, urged the government to review a scheme that reimburse medical expenses for employees injured at work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Up to now, the medical expenses [reimbursement] depends on the fee of the public hospital. So that the injured worker only can take back HK$300 per day for their medical expenses for treatment. We think that this amount is not enough for their treatment and recovery,” said Lam Ching Yee, the association’s organiser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association also called for the cost of imaging examination services, such as X-ray scans, CT scans, and MRI scans, at private clinics to be covered, allowing injured workers to quickly find out their treatment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, unionists representing property management and security guards urged the government to promote a standard working week of 44 hours and raise the minimum wage to no less than HK$56 per hour. They added that security guards are overworked while receiving wages that are not livable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A carer concern group called for changes to the Social Welfare Department's caregiver allowance, suggesting to eliminate the eligibility review mechanism, lower application thresholds, and allow caregivers to receive the allowance in their own name.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many groups also pointed to the need for a universal retirement protection scheme, advocating for a tripartite contribution model where the government, large businesses, and individual employees all contribute to the pension system.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Saturday entertained cheering crowds in Hong Kong by putting on spectacular sporting displays, as the delegation of 65 mainland athletes wrapped up their three-day visit to the territory.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Divers and swimmers headed to Victoria Park swimming pool, with synchronised swimming twins Wang Liuyi and Wang Qianyi kicking off the ticket-only demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those taking a dive into the pool was fan favourite Quan Hongchan, who received roaring cheers. The 17-year-old won the women's individual and synchronised 10m platform competitions at the Paris Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quan, who brought along her famous collection of turtle toys, introduced herself to the audience in Cantonese and ended the post-demonstration interview with a signature blessing: " Kung hei fat choy!"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fellow diver Chen Yiwen, who won two golds at the Paris Olympics, also climbed the steps to the springboard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is interesting to be able to showcase diving in such way. It's not as serious as in competitions," Chen said. "We perform in an entertaining way, and we also interact with everyone."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The demonstrations at the pool later turned cheeky with a series of wacky dives and fun leaps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Wan Chai, athletes from land-based disciplines wowed spectators with showcases of gymnastics, badminton and table tennis, among others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Badminton mixed doubles champions Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong demonstrated some techniques alongside women's doubles duo Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan, with the latter pair also trading partners with the SAR's Lianne Yeung and Yeung Pui-lam for a showdown.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To add some more fun, Sheng Lihao, who won in the men's 10m air rifle in Paris, also took a shot in badminton.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team's clean sweep of gold medals in table tennis did not go unnoticed at the stadium amid loud applause from the stands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lucky spectator was picked to play against ping pong legend Ma Long, with women's singles champion Chen Meng guiding her, hand in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The crowd also caught a glimpse of the breakdancing scene from bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, also known as "671".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rounding up the demonstrations in Wan Chai was a video speech from Hong Kong's sole two-time Olympic gold medallist, Edgar Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To be able to appreciate the grace of so many world number ones at such a close distance is really a rare thing. It's pity that I am not in Hong Kong, so I can't be here in person to participate in this event," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Saturday's events marked the end of a visit by the national team to Hong Kong, which next heads to neighbouring Macau.

 The Labour minister said on Saturday that the focus remains on the abilities as well as the perspectives of imported talents, instead of their nationalities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Around 95 per cent of those coming to Hong Kong through the Top Talent Pass Scheme are from the mainland, but Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun emphasised that it does not make the scheme any less international.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after an RTHK programme, the minister pointed out that most of the talents coming from Category C of the scheme - full time bachelor's degree graduates in the past five years with less than three years of work experience - attained their degrees from universities in the United States.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While they may be from the mainland, they received their higher education in America. Obviously, they have a more international perspective. With these people in Hong Kong, I am sure they are going to bring benefits and will add value to our economy," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first batch of talents is expected to apply for a visa renewal as soon as early next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Although the bureau is still conducting a review of the scheme, which was rolled out in 2022, it still plans to diversify its pool of overseas talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said that Malaysia will be the authorities' first destination in Southeast Asia, citing the compatibility with the ethnic Chinese community there who are mostly trilingual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Sun added that the government has approved 21,000 applications for the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed that if the shortage of local labour forces is alleviated, the authority will "definitely" reduce its quotas for imported labour.

<div class="itemFullText">
 As the new school year begins on Monday, a psychologist is urging parents to pay attention to their children's emotional, physiological and behavioural well-being.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheryl So, a senior clinical psychologist at Kwai Chung Hospital, stressed that students of different ages face different forms of stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While pre-schoolers struggle to leave their comfort zones and adapt to unfamiliar environments, primary and secondary school students are expected to learn to be independent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Parents are advised to look out for signs of potential problems such as depression, extreme mood swings, headaches, stomachaches, prolonged sleep disturbances, fear of separation from family or excessive self-criticism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If such symptoms persist for more than a month, they should seek professional help," So said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said that teachers and parents can play different roles depending on the developmental stage of their students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like for kindergarten, for parents, I think the first day of school is better to give them a very positive goodbye. They have to leave familiar people. They have to go to some uncharted area, that is, school," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For more than two decades, the hospital has worked with the education sector and charities to raise awareness of mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 16,000 students from over 100 schools have taken part in programmes that facilitate interaction with people who have recovered from mental health problems, with the aim of combating stigma.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We provide some talk on common mental health issues students will face. And then we'll also teach them some stress management, emotion regulation skills. We also provide some workshops to train them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How to deal with mental health issues... how to interact with a person in recovery... so through the contact with them, they will realize mental illness is not that horrible. And they will have a more accurate understanding of mental illness and better experience with people in recovery."

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng, who is taking on three events at the Games at the age of just 14, finished in 3mins, 11.95 seconds. She'd qualified fifith fastest for the final. She's next in action late on Sunday in the 100m breaststroke SB6 final and has the 100m backstroke event to come later in the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SM6 category denotes medley swimming races for athletes with a number of different types of disability including short stature, major limb impairment or loss in two limbs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elsewhere, boccia athlete Annie Cheung Yuen made it a clean sweep in group play, beating Phonsila Nuanchan of Thailand 5-2. After topping Pool C in the women's BC4 event, she takes on Brazilian Polyana Teixeira in the quarter finals on Sunday morning.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday strongly condemned untruthful remarks smearing the freedom of press in Hong Kong, after former editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing in a statement, the authorities said officials from the United States and Western countries, anti-China organisations and some foreign media had made "untruthful and purely political" remarks regarding the judgment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said freedom of the press is protected under Hong Kong law, but it stressed that reporters must follow the principle of "responsible journalism".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Like all other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. Journalists, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. Their freedom of commenting on and criticising government policies remains uninhibited as long as they do not violate the law," it wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the media and relevant personnel publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security or public order, or of public health or morals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities pointed out that the District Court had said the relevant reports and articles by Stand News were not based on facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reasons for verdict have also pointed out clearly that the ideology of Stand News was localism which excluded China, and that it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government during the 'anti-extradition amendment bill incidents'," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government added that the United States and Western countries had "double standards", as these countries have carried out enforcement actions against the dissemination of disinformation and incitement of hatred.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National team Olympians on Friday showed off some of their skills and shared insights and stories from the Paris Games at an evening gala.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium was one of the events where local fans could interact with the competitors during their three-day visit to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the opening of the show, Chief Executive John Lee said Hong Kong residents had been looking forward to meeting the elite athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the Olympics, Hong Kong had a fiery atmosphere for the Games, and residents watched free broadcasts through the night to support the mainland and SAR athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From watching the broadcast from ten thousand miles away, to seeing the athletes first-hand, I believe everyone is excited and looking forward to the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some athletes shared positive vibes with Hong Kong fans, and showcased their skills at the stadium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I, of course, have to play for my country on the court, but in life, I think we need to chill out, and be happy. I hope everyone can spend every day happily," table tennis player Sun Yingsha said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shuttler Zheng Siwei said he missed his usual mixed doubles teammate Huang Yaqiong after being assigned a new partner. However, he was happy to be reunited with Huang at the Paris Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People only cherish something after losing it. I believe everyone’s experienced this before. Please cherish the one who fights alongside with you and the one who accompanies you," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland athletes, such as table tennis player Fan Zhendong and diver Quan Hongchan, used Cantonese to greet the audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A few SAR Olympians, such as gold medal fencer Vivian Kong, and shuttlers Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet, were also at the stadium and shared their experiences with the audience.

 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday said it has fined WeChat Pay Hong Kong for failing to prevent risks associated with the financing of terrorism and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Following an investigation, the digital wallet service provider was ordered to pay a penalty of HK$875,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the authority said WeChat Pay Hong Kong does not have a robust system for conducting customer due diligence reviews upon incidents that pose a risk of money laundering or the financing of terrorism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKMA executive director Raymond Chan urged mobile wallet service operators to strengthen their due diligence procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "SVF (Stored Value Facilities) licensees should apply enhanced due diligence measures on their customers in situations involving potentially high risk of money laundering and terrorist financing," Chan said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These enhanced due diligence measures should be effective in ensuring that the associated money laundering and terrorist financing risks are properly managed."

    'Disabled people could be an asset to local employers'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Social Workers Association (HKSWA) on Friday urged local employers to recruit more disabled people when considering their hiring needs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said the number of disabled people who had attained a bachelor's degree from eight UGC-funded universities tripled to around 1,500 in the academic year spanning 2023 to 2024, compared to four years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKSWA recommended that companies be given training before hiring people with disabilities, so they can be assigned tasks according to their strengths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athena Ng, who is visually impaired, said she was worried about communicating with her peers in the workplace.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people rely on visuals on when they communicate. For example, they would point at a particular object when referring to it. But the visually impaired are unable to [do that], leading to communication issues," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng now works for a product development company that cooperates with the Hong Kong Blind Union to train the disabled as badminton racket stringers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director Kwan Wing-fai revealed his company has employed four disabled persons - all but one suffered from hearing difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He was concerned about their working abilities to begin with, but he found these worries were unfounded as they performed even better than able-bodied people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They completed the project on time and even completed it earlier than our target. I think they give me the confidence to employ the disabled again," Kwan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ricky Kwan from the HKSWA's Professional Development Committee said many non-governmental organisations are doing a good job in supporting people with disabilities by providing them with training and counselling services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But I think the government may do more, for example, the government can support NGOs, to give more resources to NGOs to promote or support enterprises to foster an inclusive culture in the business sector."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Retail sales fell 11.8 percent in July compared to the same month last year, marking the fifth month of declines.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Friday showed the total value of retail sales came in at HK$29.1 billion in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slump follows a 9.7 percent drop in June and an 11.4 percent decrease in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined further in July from a year earlier amid the continued impact of the change in consumption patterns and the strong Hong Kong dollar," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More outbound travels by residents during the summer holidays was also one of the factors."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looking ahead, the government said challenges remain, but the authorities will continue to support small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the retail industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University (PolyU) on Friday called on the government to encourage students from countries involved in the Belt and Road initiative to work in Hong Kong after completing their studies here.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The request is part of the university's proposals to Chief Executive John Lee for his policy address in October.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, the university's vice-president for research and innovation, Christopher Chao, said the government should increase subsidies and scholarships for these students, adding that the advantages of doing so extend beyond the education sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because when we are going to all these 'One Belt One Road' countries, apart from the educational part, in fact, we are also talking about a possibility of doing investment," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we are talking about the investment ecosystem, we are talking about how these things can be integrated together."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chao also urged the authorities to extend the Strive and Rise programme – which pairs students from underprivileged backgrounds with volunteer mentors – to countries participating in the Belt and Road initiative.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said such a move would help children in developing nations, while enhancing the global image of Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday re-appointed former lawmaker Lam Tai-fai as the head of RTHK's advisory board, with his new two-year term beginning on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the administration said five other board members were re-appointed, including media veteran Ronald Chiu and former Law Society president Thomas So.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Board has provided invaluable advice to the Director of Broadcasting and assisted RTHK in fulfilling its public purposes and mission as set out in the Charter of RTHK," Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am grateful that Lam and the five incumbent members have accepted reappointment to continue serving on the Board."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government also announced seven new members to the body, including City University governing council member Robert Lui, sports scholar Jim Luk, NGO chief Kitty Chau and Meggy Cheng, a top executive at a local dance academy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister thanked the outgoing members, which include lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen and Chinese University media scholar Anthony Fung, for their contributions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers had the chance to meet members of the national Olympic team on Friday, as a delegation held various meet-and-greet events on the second day of a three-day visit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A group of 65 competitors from Team China are in the SAR to celebrate their success at this year's Games, after bringing home 91 medals from Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some competitors went to the Sports Institute and a school, where many aspiring athletes and students waited in anticipation to meet them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One girl, 10, came with a portrait of her favourite athletes, saying meeting them was an opportunity she could not pass up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I live in the building next door. I was doing my summer homework when I saw the athletes coming out of the car outside my window. I told my mom to immediately take me there to meet them," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I watched most of the competition that they had broadcast. As long as I can see my favourite athletes, no matter how much sacrifice or hard work, I am happy and willing to do so."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A form 1 student surnamed Ho waited outside the Sports Institute in the hope of meeting the athletes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I hope I can interact with them up close. I really like Ma Long, Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha. I started noticing Ma Long after watching the last Olympics and that inspired me to take up table tennis. I started the sport because of him," the boy said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some athletes participated in a meet-and-greet event with the disciplined services at the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy to showcase their skills and interact with young people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fans cheered as the athletes entered the stadium in an open-top bus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the exchange session, some youth representatives got to play table tennis against Ma and Fan Zhendong, who made do with a pot lid and a spatula as their paddles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said he was honoured and excited that the mainland athletes had come to Hong Kong, and praised them for their perseverance and unyielding spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My favourite is weightlifter Li Wenwen. She picked up her coach after she won gold and shouted 'We're done with work!' Wasn't that so exciting?," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The national team's perseverance, superior skillset, passionate performance and dedication to the country are all in line with Hong Kong's disciplinary forces, and also the spirit of the disciplinary forces."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation was to visit Victoria Peak and Victoria Harbour in the afternoon to take in the sights, before a gala show at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The visit will end on Saturday with sporting demonstrations in the morning for the public to enjoy, including badminton, gymnastics, table tennis, diving and swimming.

    Beijing blasts criticism of Stand News court verdict

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768297_1_20240830114245.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has hit out at statements made by the United States, Britain and the European Union after a court convicted two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller called the verdict "a direct attack on media freedom", while Britain's foreign office minister for the Indo-Pacific, Catherine West, said the SAR administration should "end politicised prosecutions of journalists and uphold press and publication freedoms" and the European Union said the ruling was "yet another sign of the dwindling space for press freedom".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said the court's decision safeguarded national security and the rule of law in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson also criticised the West of using press freedom as a political tool to make excuses for anti-China organisations, and smearing and attacking the rule of law in the SAR to advocate the so-called "chilling effect".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It went to say that press freedom in the territory has been better protected under a safe and stable environment following the implementation of the national security laws, and urged relevant politicians to stop harbouring criminals and interfering in the SAR's judicial and internal affairs.

    Vulnerable newborns to get dedicated care at hospital

Photo Courtesy of the Hospital Authority" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768278_1_20240830085501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Mary Hospital has set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to look after babies born prematurely, while providing psychological and even palliative support for parents in case of emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-strong team comprises obstetric and paediatric healthcare professionals, clinical psychologists, and social workers. It has helped the parents of over 20 babies since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team springs into action whenever a baby is delivered between 23 and 25 weeks, the so-called periviability interval where medical intervention is often needed in order for the newborn to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to a quarter of the infants also develop severe disabilities later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading the team is Mimi Seto, an associate consultant at the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said apart from caring for premature babies, the team also intervenes by delaying pre-term labour for expecting mothers by prescribing them medication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We use] antenatal steroid drugs to enhance the fetal lung maturity, and give them magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If needed, if [the mothers] are in pre-term labour, having regular contractions, we might also give the mother tocolytic therapy, which is a drug to stop the uterus from contracting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic, Seto said, is to allow the baby to receive sufficient prenatal treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she admitted tocolytic therapy may have side effects to the mother, even though it is safe most of the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some cases, the hospital also provides palliative care to parents, including counselling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seto suggested all mothers-to-be, especially those with a history of pre-term birth, to seek antenatal care as soon as their pregnancy begins and follow the advice by obstetricians.

 Members of the national team arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday to celebrate their success at this year's Olympics, with a delegation including 59 competitors who were either individual champions or part of winning teams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of 65 competitors were in the SAR for a three-day visit, with events including an evening reception and banquet hosted by the Hong Kong government, followed by a gala show and sporting demonstrations in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the athletes at a banquet, Chief Executive John Lee said their visit will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to pursue careers in the sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking back, the mainland's Olympic athletes delegation has visited Hong Kong several times. Their visits not only enhance emotional exchanges of the people between the two places, but also facilitate the exchange and development of sports culture," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that this visit will further deepen the profound friendship between Hong Kong and the mainland. It will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in sports careers and strive for excellence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation visiting the SAR was all-time great in table tennis, Ma Long, sporting a gold from the team event – the sixth he has won in his illustrious career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meet-the-media event, Ma said it was the fourth time he had joined a visit to Hong Kong, adding that he is always touched by the warm greetings he receives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time around, I hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the young people in Hong Kong. I think this would definitely be a special memory in my career," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the Olympics, many people have been asking me about my future plans. As of now, I am still an athlete. Of course, if there are any changes, I will definitely let everyone know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving superstar Quan Hongchan had captured the hearts of many fans with her cute personality as she struck gold again in the women's individual 10 metres platform and the synchronised 10 metres platform with teammate Chen Yuxi.

  Meanwhile, swimmer Pan Zhanle, who made headlines for his world record-setting victory in the 100 metres freestyle, said he was looking forward to meeting the public.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam were convicted of conspiring to publish and reproduce seditious publications between July 2020 and December 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News' parent company, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty of the same offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written judgement, District Court judge Kwok Wai-kin ruled that 11 of the 17 publications raised by the prosecution were seditious, noting the political climate at the time was extremely heated and many people were unhappy with the SAR and central governments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The published materials included interviews with opposition figures as well as commentaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that the political ideology of Stand News was localism and its stance was to "support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the anti-extradition bill movement, it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government,” Kwok wrote in the judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that Chung knew and approved of the articles’ seditious intentions and offered Stand News as a platform to incite hatred against central and SAR authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge also noted that Lam approved one of the articles found to be seditious, while at the same time voicing support for the anti-extradition bill movement in a forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict, originally slated for last October, was postponed three times pending an appeal in a separate sedition case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing has been adjourned to September 26, and both Chung and Lam were freed on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They each face up to two years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was absent from the hearing on Thursday due to a health issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence lawyer Audrey Eu read Lam’s mitigation letter in court, which said Stand News journalists sought to run a news outlet with fully independent editorial standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Journalists are not only responsible for their own reports. They are also failing in their duty if they deliberately avoid reporting when they know the public has the right to be informed,” Eu quoted Lam as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also revealed that Lam is suffering from a “rare disease” that required chemotherapy, and it would be difficult for him to receive medical care if jailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written mitigation letter submitted to the court, Chung said it is the “inescapable responsibility” of journalists to report the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior counsel Eu told the court that both defendants had spent over 10 months behind bars before getting bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News closed down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, chief superintendent from the national security unit, Steve Li, said police welcomed the court's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the national security department took the enforcement against the Stand News on December 2021, some people criticised us that we are suppressing the freedom of the speech and the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the judge's verdict has clearly illustrated the necessity and the lawfulness of the enforcement [action] taken on that day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at another event, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said authorities respected and valued media freedom, which is protected by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all journalists report based on facts, I think there would not be situations restricting the freedom of the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Criticising the government is not an action that is not allowed. We see news articles criticising the government every day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late Thursday evening, a government spokesman said "any individual or organisation that incites hatred and engages in acts and activities endangering national security can never escape sanctions of the law, and such malicious acts will surely be duly punished."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added, "To distort words and acts that incite hatred as 'journalistic work' as such individuals and organisations did is indeed the gravest insult against the professional journalists of Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A High Court jury on Thursday convicted one person and cleared six others over a plot to bomb and shoot police officers in 2019, after Hong Kong's first-ever trial involving United Nations anti-terrorism legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Chun-pong, who was 29 when he was arrested, was found guilty of conspiracy to cause explosion likely to endanger life or property.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to appear in court next Monday to offer a mitigation plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six co-defendants, Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Justin Hui and Lau Pui-ying were cleared of related charges, including conspiring to set off bombs and conspiracy to murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Cheung Chun-fu, had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and firearms and was given an 18-month prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution had told the court that the bomb plot involved planting explosives in Wan Chai during a rally to mark International Human Rights Day in December 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, chief superintendent Steve Li from the national security police said he would not comment on the court's decision, but stressed the case was very serious in nature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very serious case, involving genuine firearms, explosives, and a very organised plot to kill police and other innocent people as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But as a police, I can assure that we have tried our best to protect our society."

    Labour rights group says heat protections not enough

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Survey shows workers felt unwell while working under hot weather and 40 percent of employers provided insufficient heat relief measures. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768168_1_20240829165538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour rights group, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, on Thursday said around 40 percent of employers had insufficient measures to prevent heat stroke among workers during hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association surveyed around 400 workers, mainly construction workers and cleaners, between June and August 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of respondents had felt unwell while working under hot weather, with symptoms including dizziness and headaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also found that workers lacked sufficient rest time during hot conditions, with 40 percent of respondents saying they did not have the basic 10 to 15 minutes of rest every two hours, while nearly half did not receive extra rest during a Heat Stress at Work Warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, head of the association, said employers misunderstood the guidelines from the Labour Department, leading to workers' rest times being reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we only focus on when the heat warning is in effect, the employer needs to provide equipment or measures for cooling. But if they do that, they can reduce the rest time. This is the misleading information for us, because our calculation is we must have a basic rest time, 10 to 15 minutes, plus the extra resting time when the heat warning is in effect. I think most employers or employees do not know this information."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested the government emphasise workers' basic rest time and eliminate the "rest time reducing" approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu believed that due to a lack of legal weight behind the current guidelines, employers may not be willing to cooperate proactively with the recommendations. She hopes legislation could be enacted in future to hold employers accountable.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resource body on Thursday said its research indicated the development and real estate sectors would need more workers in the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management based the finding on a study of 300 companies in 20 sectors between April and June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the overall workforce in Hong Kong would grow by two percent by 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute said demand for manpower in fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction was expected to grow by up to nine percent, due to major development projects such as the Northern Metropolis and Kau Yi Chau Artificial Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, technological advances would lead to fewer jobs in the retail, transportation and media sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute's president Lawrence Hung, called on the government to adjust its talent recruitment efforts accordingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should actively listen to industry feedback, provide more proactive measures for businesses to fill vacancies, and adjust talent admission schemes based on actual circumstances to effectively attract overseas talent to supplement the local talent pool," he said in a statement.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday rolled out the red carpet for a delegation of athletes who competed for the national team at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  SAR officials and primary school students welcomed the 90-member delegation at the airport, which included 65 elite athletes, eight coaches and some administrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan thanked the Olympians for making a three-day visit to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe many Hong Kong residents are as happy as I am. I thank the coaches and athletes for coming to Hong Kong just shortly after the closing of the Olympic Games, allowing us to get a close-up glimpse of the national team athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan, who led the delegation said he felt welcome as soon as he arrived, adding the mainland and Hong Kong should work together to carry forward the spirit of sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have exchanges with the SAR government, departments and residents, especially young people. We will learn from each other, build friendships and contribute to the development of the motherland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eight-year-old fan was at the airport to greet the athletes and he said he couldn't sleep the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I was too excited! I'd been waiting for this day to come and I couldn't sleep at night! I want to meet Quan Hongchan the most because I like diving. But I'm too short so I couldn't see her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan said she wanted to meet the table tennis players the most, but she failed to grab a ticket for the gala show and demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to buy a ticket, but I failed. Everyone loves them...I was so excited when I saw Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha because I supported them throughout the whole Paris Olympics," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will meet the press on Thursday afternoon and attend a reception and banquet hosted by the SAR government in the evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They will also meet fans at a gala show on Friday and showcase their skills in a series of demonstrations on Saturday.

 A senior field assistant died on Wednesday after losing consciousness on the job at Tai Mo Shan Country Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam Kin-wai, 46, who worked in the Conservation Branch of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, injured his right palm when collecting plant specimens with his colleagues in the morning before losing consciousness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His colleagues called the police for help, but he was pronounced dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the cause of death would be investigated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mickey Lai, director of the AFCD, said the department would provide support and assistance to Lam's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having joined the AFCD for over 13 years, Mr Lam served the community with dedication and perseverance. His performance was excellent and he was held in high regard by colleagues," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am deeply grieved at the loss of such a devoted colleague. On behalf of all our colleagues, I offer the deepest condolences to his family."

    Ng Tung River may be home to endangered Eurasian otter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation experts are urging people to keep an eye out next time they're walking by a river, as they may catch a rare glimpse of an endangered Eurasian otter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden on Wednesday said they have found traces of the mammals' faeces by the Ng Tung River near Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said that previously, signs of the creature had only been found in remote areas, and this discovery proves that they can live close to urban districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Jianhuan, Conservation Manager of Kadoorie Conservation China, said this is the first time the farm has found signs of the animals in rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new finding in the Ng Tung River is also very important because previously the otters recorded in Hong Kong were mainly in mangrove forests and the fish pond areas, and this is the record that proves the otter can inhabit the water channels close to urban areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the expert warned that planned developments for the Northern Metropolis could threaten the otters' habitats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are not mountain species, they don't live in the country parks. They live in low land and much of their habitats are unprotected and under severe human disturbance... and all these lowland wetlands are right within the Northern Metropolis area," Yang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that if people do manage to spot one of the otters, they should leave it alone and contact the organisation.

 Official figures showed home prices in Hong Kong continued to fall last month, whereas rents reached their highest in nearly five years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to data from the Rating and Valuation Department, private flats were 1.9 percent cheaper in July than the month before, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home prices briefly rose after the government scrapped all market-cooling measures in February, before the downward trend resumed in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, prices were down by 4.7 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said sales may pick up after interest rates start to fall, with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it will begin reducing borrowing costs in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, strong demand pushed rents up by 1.1 percent last month from June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That raised private sector rents to their highest levels since October 2019.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday ordered a retrial in the case of a man cleared of involvement in a mob attack in and around Yuen Long MTR Station in July 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had earlier appealed against the District Court's decision to acquit Wong Chi-wing on charges of rioting and wounding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher court accepted that appeal and remitted the case to the District Court for retrial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong was released on bail ahead of an expected court appearance on October 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four others – Tang Wai-sum, Ng Wai-nam, Tang Ying-bun and Choi Lap-ki – were earlier jailed for between three and seven years on the same charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi's conviction was later quashed on appeal, while the other three lost challenges against their convictions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said panda lovers may have to wait until February next year before they catch a glimpse of the new twin babies born earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Times, Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong made reference to the panda twins born in Macau in 2016, noting that cubs would normally be at least six months old before going on display and meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for two adult giant pandas that are set to arrive in the SAR next month as gifts by the mainland authorities, Pong said they are expected to the meet the public in December at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the number of people visiting the giant pandas would be restricted in the initial stage, which would allow them to better adapt to the new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong added that Ocean Park would look for names for the cubs and the new giant pandas in the next few months, and hopes the public can provide suggestions.

    Priority for new parents in choosing subsidised homes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The authority's subsidised housing committee chairperson, Cleresa Wong, says she is not worried about the demand for this latest batch of HOS flats. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767870_1_20240827175919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications for more than 7,100 government-subsidised homes will open in the fourth quarter of this year, with households that have newborns being given priority when selecting homes for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new units in the latest round of the Home Ownership Scheme are from five estates – in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Yau Tong, Tung Chung and Tuen Mun – and priced from HK$1.43 million to HK$4.67 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants are expected to be able to select subsidised homes from the second quarter of 2025, which are marked with a 30 percent discount, smaller than the previous batch's offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleresa Wong, who chairs the Housing Authority's subsidised housing committee, said the monthly median income of target buyers has risen, meaning they are more capable of affording such homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also brushed aside concerns that a downturn in the property market would affect the sale of these homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not compare these prices with that in the private market because our target buyers are different. The buyers we want to help are those whom we have determined are unable to purchase a private market flat," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about how popular these homes will be. There are a lot of people who we have to help."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority has also set aside 40 percent of the flats, or 2,900 of them, for ballots from households with elderly members or newborns, who will have priority when choosing their desired homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to boost the city's birth rate, families with children aged three years or younger at the time of application and those who are born on or after October 25 last year will have a better chance of buying subsidised flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said successful applicants with priority are no longer picking from the entire pool of available flats, and instead each housing project will have a set proportion of units for them to choose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”This time, we hope that applicants will have a more reasonable chance of selecting the unit they want," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have noticed that in the past, people with priority tended to prefer homes with better locations and those that are larger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 10 percent of homes are earmarked for single-person household applicants, Wong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, families of two or more who are "white form" applicants will be subject to a monthly income ceiling of HK$60,000, from the previous HK$62,000, and an asset limit of HK$1.23 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount will be halved for single-person households.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month. Photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767869_1_20240827175909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month, rising 13.1 percent to HK$390.4 billion in July, when compared to the same month last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Tuesday showed imports rose 9.9 percent year-on-year to HK$412.3 billion, which left the city with a trade deficit of HK$21.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to the mainland, the United States and the European Union continued to rise, while sales to other major Asian markets had a mixed performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combining the figures for the first seven months of the year, exports jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year, while imports rose 8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said Hong Kong's exports should remain positive as long as external demand holds up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the spokesperson added that there are still risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

    Don't overlook palliative care for children: medics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chan Cheong-wai (bottom second right) says parents often prioritise seeking curative treatments, overlooking palliative care for their children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767858_1_20240827172850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paediatricians and scholars on Tuesday said parents should not overlook palliative care when their children are confronting complex diseases or symptoms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palliative care, which includes end-of-life care, is a specialised type of care aimed at alleviating pain and other symptoms associated with severe illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The call came after researchers at Polytechnic University interviewed 65 people, including children aged between eight and 19 years old, their parents, and medics between 2019 and 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Professor Frances Wong from the university's nursing school said parents need to understand how to live with the life-long diseases their children are facing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The point of treatment and diagnosis is not the end, it's just the beginning. How the parents actually face living with the disease and, therefore, a palliative care model
  <br/>
  actually has the benefits to provide that continuity of care," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that parents can start palliative care for their children even before the diagnosis is complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chan Cheong-wai, who chairs the Hong Kong Society of Children's Palliative Care, said diagnosing intricate illnesses often takes years, but parents often focus on seeking curative treatments, overseeing palliative care for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If a child had cancer, the first thing that the parents may think about will be any kind of curative treatment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So at that juncture, most of the doctors and nurses will focus on the curative treatment instead of other elements like psychological support. We are not saying that psychological support is not important, but at that time, the parents' main focus is still on the medical side."

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767850_1_20240827164639.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) on Tuesday urged the government to provide more support for parents, to boost the city's fertility rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The society said it conducted a survey from May to June involving 1,200 women who had one child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 30 percent said they would have another child, while the rest were either undecided or said they would not have any more children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reasons for ruling out a second child included the financial burden, heavy parenting responsibilities and the difficulty in balancing work and childcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKSPC director Subrina Chow said the government will make available 900 additional places in day childcare services over the next few years, but the number is still inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the long-term development of Hong Kong, in terms of helping more women or adults to be able to join the workforce and helping to increase birth rates so as to address the issues of an ageing population, we feel the government could make further investment in this area because that's going to benefit the society as a whole," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow added that not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current programmes provided by our universities and training institutions are all focused on the three to six age range, so we do need a lot more programme content to be devoted to the younger children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive introduced a HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies in last year's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chow said parents want "long-term" support instead, so the authorities should consider offering more parental leave as well as child healthcare vouchers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official data shows the number of births in the SAR dropped from 91,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Tuesday said a transformed museum documenting the War of Resistance will open to the public next week to showcase relics from the war and the country's history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On September 3, the existing Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence will be renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said officials would work with their Shenzhen counterparts to organise thematic exhibitions on the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The words 'War of Resistance' demonstrate the museum's theme of commemorating the history of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and inheriting the patriotic spirit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also aligns with the high respect for the heroes and martyrs of the War of Resistance and warns future generations to cherish peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression was one of the theatres of World War 2 in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Yui-sum, director of the Museum of History, told reporters there will be new features and performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We aim to organise more exhibitions and public programmes [for] the general public to let them know more about the War of Resistance history and the significance of this period of time, so that they can establish their self-esteem of being a Chinese and to let them know more about their motherland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said in his 2023 Policy Address that the new museum would focus on the war of resistance to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.

 The University of Hong Kong's faculty of medicine says it is planning the first clinical trials in Asia of a device designed to treat cancer with sound waves.

  Twenty liver cancer patients will be given histotripsy treatment at Queen Mary Hospital from September, the faculty said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The histotripsy is basically a very high-focus ultrasound that basically induces a sudden expansion and collapse of the cancer cells… and that creates a shock wave and that basically would break down the cancer cells and we call it liquefying the cancer cells. That would completely kill the cancer cells,” said professor Albert Chan from the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And what is so different from the usual treatment is actually the minimally invasiveness. So without any scars, any wounds, we can now treat the patients... This is a non-radiation treatment, so we can actually apply it to a broad spectrum of patients.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Hong Kong, with about 1,700 to 1,800 new cases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mike Blue – a representative of the manufacturer of the machine involved – said the technology could be used to treat most cancers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This particular system has been designed in the future to treat everywhere really from the neck down. So we envision years from now, histotripsy and this particular system will be used to treat thyroid, breast, sarcomas, liver, kidney, pancreas, really anywhere in the body,” the HistoSonics CEO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue added that the treatment is also effective on recurrent cancer patients, adding that it has already been used in the US on those with early and advanced stages of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that after the clinical trial on liver cancer at HKU is completed in about two years, the team plans to carry out clinical studies in the SAR for other types of cancer, including kidney and pancreatic cancer.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Almost half of a planned academic town near the border will be built on land in a rural village in Yuen Long, according to Development Secretary Bernadette Linn.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Northern Metropolis University Town" will be for local educational institutions to strengthen cooperation with their mainland and overseas counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town, as part of the massive Northern Metropolis project, will cover more than 60 hectares at Hung Shui Kiu, Ha Tsuen, Ngau Tam Mei and a new town in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said some 20 hectares of the academic district would be around Ping Che and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also reserve about 30 hectares of land in Ngau Tam Mei for the district, Linn said, adding that a full development plan for the village could be unveiled after October's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ngau Tam Mei is very close to the San Tin Technopole. They are only one station apart. For the future Northern Link, there will be a station at San Tin and the next southbound station will be Ngau Tam Mei," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that the education district in Ngau Tam Mei should be somewhat related to the San Tin Technopole, innovation and technology, and scientific research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government will press ahead with the massive development in the New Territories, after the High Court granted an application for a judicial review of the government's decision to approve the environmental study of the San Tin Technopole project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, the development chief reiterated that the government is pushing back the reclamation process off Lantau, but isn't scrapping the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are indeed behind the original schedule, but we are not shelving the project. I am concerned that the word 'suspend' may sometimes make people feel that we are putting it down," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We may also prolong the reclamation process, because we certainly have room to think about how many phases the project should be divided into for the 1,000 hectares of reclaimed land."

    US rate cut 'should spark demand for new property'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, said developers would have to be competitive on pricing. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767774_1_20240827093321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, says he thinks an interest rate cut in the US will spark demand for residential property purchases here, although developers will have to be competitive on pricing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think we have to be honest. There's a greater degree of optimism now with the news about likely interest rate cuts by the Fed so that's feeding through into the market. I think if you ask me about market sentiment, I would say the market remains cautious but there is a greater degree of optimism," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the reality is that after 18 months of treading water, if you like, there's significant latent demand from both first-time buyers and upgraders so the demand is there I'm sure."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Friday Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said it was time for the US to start cutting interest rates and with the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar, that should mean lower borrowing costs here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said there was an estimated surplus of 20,000 to 22,000 unsold new private units, which was equivalent to at least half a year's supply. He said 7,000 to 10,000 could be sold by the end of the year and the remainder could probably be sold by the middle of next year. But he said this would mean developers would have to be competitive on pricing for at least the next 12 months or so to work through this inventory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke also said he didn't expect private residential rents to fall in the near term, even though he saw pent-up demand to buy new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I actually see rents going up. We've got the talent scheme and there's quite significant demand from the student community for rental accommodation. We're short of private rental stock in Hong Kong. If anything, I think rents may well rise in the short and medium term because there is demand, and it's real demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Brooke said the situation for commercial rents was very poor with prime office buildings in top locations in some cases being half empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, the office market is in some disarray from a vacancy and occupancy perspective," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two major buildings in Central, which are probably 40-to-50 percent let, struggling to find new tenants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the commercial market was very soft generally and that was a function of the economy at large.

    More opt for green burial for sense of comfort

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green burial is becoming increasingly popular in Hong Kong as people look for a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to handle the ashes of their loved ones.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An academic said the trend could mean less demand for public columbariums and niches, which would have a positive impact on Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department showed that the number of green burials in Hong Kong almost tripled in the past decade, to 9,381 last year from 3,400 in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green burial refers to scattering the ashes of your loved ones in gardens of remembrance or at designated waters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, a Hongkonger who now lives in Australia, scattered the ashes of his father at sea in accordance with his wishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He loved to travel... and I feel that he could enjoy his freedoms in the sea after his death," Leo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that sea burial brought him closer to his father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because he's already in the sea, I can look out at the sea and feel like I'm talking to him wherever he goes. I imagine he's with me in Australia. I can say 'Hello, how are you?' to him anytime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, meanwhile, chose a different final resting place for her mother, whose ashes were scattered at a garden of remembrance at Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine said that symbolised a sense of comfort and freedom for her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they scatter the ashes in the garden, it's like return to the nature and close to ground and close to us... that's where they land and where they choose, and they feel comfortable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some way, they feel like a bit of free up after their death."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, who now lives in Australia, said she likes to see more flexibility in funeral arrangements in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, it's very common in Australia for green burial... There are many choices... A lot of people feel if they scatter their ashes on a garden, and then they grow a tree of some sort, and they feel very romantic and like an extension of life. They choose where they want to finish. And so it's pretty flexible in Australia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amy Chow, a professor of social work at the University of Hong Kong, said people have opted for green burial as they become more aware of the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the traditional belief, if you put your essentials in a cemetery, most of the time when you worship, you will burn paper offerings, you will burn incense. And this is also not good for the environment. But if you scatter the ashes in the nature, you just like, you just need to look up to the sky and say your prayers in your heart, and it won't cause anything to the environment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow hopes that with more burial options available, there will be less demand for public columbariums and niches and the city can make better use of our land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She believes the trend of green burial will continue to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there are more choices, I do think it will diversify the choices and then the number demanding traditional way will be reduced... Actually in the free market, Hong Kong people are still having a lot of choices, like they can turn the ashes into diamond, into artwork, into glassware. And also they may bring it to this space through private service, via, you know, Nasa.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau has pledged to make Hong Kong a multinational supply chain management centre to attract more mainland firms to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony on Monday, the secretary for commerce and economic development said his bureau was coordinating with relevant authorities to provide one-stop services for companies to come to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To facilitate the country's accelerated development of new quality productive forces, the SAR government is committed to building Hong Kong into a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting more mainland manufacturers to set up here, managing their offshore trade headquarters, providing comprehensive and complete professional services, and assisting firms to upgrade their supply chain and expanding overseas business," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said more than 700 firms have opened or expanded their business in Hong Kong since last year, bringing huge investment and employment opportunities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political heavyweights attending a seminar promoting the spirit of the third plenum on Monday said the session highlighted Hong Kong's role in national development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two senior Beijing officials, Shen Chunyao and Wang Wentao, held a seminar on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of China's Communist Party, which wrapped up in Beijing last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters after the seminar that the SAR can contribute in a lot of ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two VIPs do suggest a lot of Hong Kong strengths, and the CE does suggest that we have to incorporate into our daily life. I totally agree with them, and we have to [take] action and we have to use Hong Kong's ability to contribute to the future of our country," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Executive councillor and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said Hong Kong has to work harder to lure global talent and enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the near future and also in the distant future, we have to attract more companies to come and settle in Hong Kong and also talent to come to Hong Kong to help us progress. Hong Kong can go from strength to strength," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not have to worry too much about the fake news that is demonstrated by the liars everywhere around the world. We have to make sure that we do what is right for the country and for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yuk-shan, deputy director of the Basic Law Committee, said the session clearly spelled out the timeline for deepening reforms and the country's future plans.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Monday highlighted the key roles of Hong Kong and its contribution to the country, while also stressing that China's development offers the strongest support for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's Communist Party earlier wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a seminar held in Hong Kong on promoting the spirit of the plenum, Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress, said the country must rely on reform and opening up to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through reform and opening up, we have to promote the modernisation with Chinese characteristics... Reform and opening up have been crucial to the course of the party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shen, who also chairs the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, pointed to a particular role for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles, given their respective strengths as 'super-connectors'. Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles in telling China's story well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the resolution, Beijing stated its support for Hong Kong's bid in becoming an "international hub for high-end talent" and consolidating its status as an international finance, maritime and trading centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said as a separate customs territory and a free port, the SAR serves as an important bridge for trade and investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also said Hong Kong should expand its talent pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong has long been nurturing talent from different parts of the world, and has a great business environment and a highly internationalised market. The education system and city life are very attractive. These are Hong Kong's strengths in pooling talent from far and wide,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the One Country, Two Systems principle is "the biggest advantage" Hong Kong has.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When it comes to support, our country's development is the biggest support that Hong Kong can get," Wang said. "I personally think that national strength and capacity is the biggest support for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, said the top-level meeting showed the central government's high hopes for the SAR, and that the city should stay determined and find new ways to contribute to the country's reform and opening up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is extensive discussion of reform measures about Hong Kong. This shows the solicitude and high expectations of the central government. This is a strategic fulcrum for Hong Kong to shine. This also means new opportunities for Hong Kong to go from stability to prosperity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, said Hong Kong has played a key role in the country's reform and opening up and the SAR must be more proactive in integrating into the development of the nation.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five more people were arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging in an operation that has seen more than 20 people investigated since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alleged mastermind and core syndicate members of the same syndicate were among 20 arrested in the first joint-operation between the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Competition Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two statutory bodies revealed on Monday they carried out a second joint-operation last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the five were suspected of engaging in acts which corrupted the renovation projects of two Hong Kong Island housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The key members of the syndicate allegedly offered advantages to members of the Owners' Corporation through middlemen, so as to ensure the two syndicate-controlled companies would be awarded the contracts worth HK$140 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the projects had yet to begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Competition Commission also found the arrestees were allegedly involved in tender-rigging for contracts on 38 residential estates and industrial buildings amounting to over HK$1 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The highest amount involved a contract worth HK$260 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Au, head of investigations of the Competition Commission, said their investigation found that when renovation contracts were opened for tender, staff of the company concerned were alleged to have directly, or through middlemen, exchanged and coordinated the bidding price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the project contractors, meanwhile, carried out cover bidding, such as through using a higher bidding price to cover for others, until they have controlled the bidding results, and helped the designated bidder to win the tender," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers seized several computers, mobile phones, as well as related documents after searching around 20 premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not rule out more arrests.

    HK should study and embrace 3rd plenum spirit: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should learn from and embrace the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and integrate it into daily life, Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 500 government officials, Executive Council members and lawmakers on Monday morning attended a seminar held at the government headquarters promoting the spirit of the plenum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks were led by Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who's also the Secretary of the CPC leadership group of the Ministry of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third plenum, which wrapped up last month in Beijing, adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the seminar, Lee said studying the spirit of the third plenum was beneficial to the SAR's long-term development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand its importance and significance for Hong Kong's future development, seize the opportunities, and further leverage Hong Kong's advantages of being highly internationalised, market-oriented, and rule of law-based under the 'One Country, Two Systems' system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable role in the country's further reform and opening up. As a super connector and super value-adder, Hong Kong continues to play an important role as a bridge and window connecting the mainland and the world in going global and bringing in [enterprises]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about measures to attract high-end talent from around the world, Lee said the SAR government had introduced a series of programmes to bring in graduates from top universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said there were 340,000 applications for the Top Talent Pass Scheme so far, of which 210,000 had been approved.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chinese University on Monday appointed Kenneth Chen as a vice-president.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The former secretary general of the Legislative Council Secretariat will begin a three-year term on September 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chen will be responsible for administering infrastructure development according to the university's strategic vision and will also oversee administrative resources and operations to support the institution's academic, teaching and research activities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I have gained a deep appreciation of the importance of good institutional governance and effective management teamwork from my previous roles," Chen said in a press release.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am confident that these experiences will guide me as I work closely with members of the university in the common goal of furthering the development of this renowned educational institution."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The search committee for the position unanimously recommended Chen to the university's council.
  <br/>

    'Revenue not the only consideration for land sales'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development chief Bernadette Linn says financial proceeds are just one of the factors the government considers when it comes to the pace of land sales, saying market sentiment and the effect on prices of putting a plot up for sale are also important.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a sluggish property market, the government has eight plots in its land sale programme in the current financial year. One plot in Sha Tin was put up for sale in the last quarter, and another in the same area in the quarter before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said if a plot goes unsold or the bids received are far lower than market estimates, it can hurt property prices in the relevant district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials therefore need to assess the sentiments of the market and developers when making decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the land sale programme can serve as an adjustment tool and if there is sufficient private land, then the government doesn't need to roll out as much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that in the past three financial years, not all sites in the programme were made available for bidding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also described the economy as being at a turning point right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many people have expectations about the US cutting interest rates later. Will Hong Kong follow? Everyone can see the market sentiments, like in the past half a year, there has been economic growth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But everyone is taking the wait and see approach - whether the growth is sustainable. Investors are taking that approach, and so are developers who bid for land."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also shot down the idea of returning to the system before 2013, when land sales were triggered by developers' applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government needs to have control over land provision and stability, saying the public could get very pessimistic about the market if developers are conservative and don't make applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the current financial year, the government has yet to put up any commercial plots for sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said if office vacancy rates in the upcoming quarters remain similar to current levels, there's a chance the government will continue to defer rolling out plots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said there are currently plenty of commercial buildings under construction, and so supply is not a problem.

    CUHK unveils novel remote endoscopy surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The research team in Zurich demonstrates how to use a joystick to remotely control an endoscope in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A surgeon in Zurich has performed the world’s first remote endoscopy procedure on a pig in Hong Kong, as researchers believe it paves the path for better and immediate surgical care in remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure was conducted in May as part of a joint-study between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) which started two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinician in Switzerland controlled a surgical controller that was remotely connected across 9,300 kilometres to an endoscope in the operating theatre in Hong Kong, CUHK said, noting that the endoscope matched every movement the clinician made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design was to use multiple small magnets to build our endoscope and use a magnetic field to control the direction, forward, backward, turn left, turn right, to control the angulation of the endoscope to perform an endoscopy," says Dr Shannon Chan from CUHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the surgeon in Switzerland would use the controller to control the magnetic field in Hong Kong and thus, with that, he could control the endoscope.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chan said the technology could be a game-changer for remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For places where they are lacking in experts, for example, in gastrointestinal disease, then the experts in their hometown can control and perform the endoscope for patients… so the experts can diagnose and treat patients from afar,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are hoping that with this technology... we are able to train doctors in resource-limited areas to perform some procedures remotely instead of having to fly over to their country to teach them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dr Chan noted a key prerequisite would be a stable Wi-Fi network in those areas, saying that would take a few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it's too early to compare the success rate of remote surgery with conventional procedure, saying the research team's next step is to prove the procedure is safe on human patients.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have called on people who want to join the force to enrol in their mentorship programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior inspector Jaffy Chan, overseeing recruitment, said the mentorship initiative would help candidates when applying to join the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said figures showed that one in five programme participants would successfully secure the position of Probationary Inspector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This success rate surpasses that of non-participants, where only one out of every 27 people succeeded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan explained that those who join the mentorship programme would gain hands-on experience and personal coaching from police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The very intentions of the rolling out of the programme is to allow mentees to have a diverse experience in getting to know what the police does, and how it's like to be a police officer should they join in the future," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, for this programme, every mentee is assigned with a mentor who will give them personal experience and coaching and workshop for their preparations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, 228 people joined the police mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was 24-year-old Luce Lo, who took a two-month hiatus from her full-time job as a financial adviser for the mentorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said she was motivated to join the Police Force after the mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My determination is far more than before I have joined this internship, because through
  <br/>
  the daily interactions with the police inspectors or those colleagues, I see some qualities and also their professionalism being a police [officer]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applications for next year's mentorship programme will open on September 9.
