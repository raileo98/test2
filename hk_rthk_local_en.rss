<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he expects half of Hong Kong's companies would be using artificial intelligence by the end of this year, adding that technology and innovation is the government's priority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference, Lee said the SAR understands the important role technology plays in the future of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong continues to evolve. As we embrace new technologies and sustainable practices, we strengthen our position as the foreign investment gateway to mainland China, and as the conduit for mainland enterprises to invest in the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation is a central priority of the Hong Kong SAR government. That includes applying AI technology to fast track our smart city and digital government ambitions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the government was launching more than 100 digital government and smart-city initiatives and expediting the establishment of an AI Supercomputing Centre in Cyberport.

    Govt not given up on waste charging: environment chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green groups disagreed with the government's decision to postpone waste charging indefinitely, but the environment minister stressed officials had not given up on the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration announced on Monday it would not implement the pay-as-you-throw scheme on August 1 as originally planned, citing concerns among residents and the limited coverage of recycling facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said it was not suitable to set a date for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our society has to be mature enough to accept this approach. Also, when the policy is introduced, its design has to be easy and accepted by the public, and be straight forward for frontline workers," Tse told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the coming year, we will of course expand our efforts on waste reduction and recycling, as well as promotion. On the other hand, we will also look at how we can enhance the scheme, gauge public sentiment, and see whether we have the conditions to introduce waste charging. We are not giving up on this concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the government might roll out waste charging in phases if officials decided to re-introduce the scheme in future, so that it's more easily accepted by the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edwin Lau, the founder and executive director of The Green Earth, told the same programme that the decision in postponing the scheme reflected a lack of faith and determination in the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the government's poll showed a majority of residents opposed waste charging, he understood the business sector was ready for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many large companies and organisations said they had been prepared and had no issue [with the policy]. I have also asked some from the middle class, they said [paying] HK$50 a month was a very small amount," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government appeared to have amplified negative responses to the policy, but did not focus on positive feedbacks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Wendell Chan from Friends of the Earth called on the government to dig deeper to understand public opinion on the policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we need to know is why opinion shifted, what happened there, what caused people to not like this scheme," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we went in-depth enough, in terms of analysing these problems in order to tackle them. The problem is that the government, right now, is way too willing to back down instead of trying to resolve these issues."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, called for more recycling points.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There has been a mixed reaction to the news that the government has indefinitely postponed the roll-out of its waste charging scheme. Some lawmakers say they back the decision, noting that a trial had found many concerns about the pay-as-you-throw initiative. Others insisted that Hong Kong still has to find ways to better manage its waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, says a delay is reasonable. But he says officials should now get back to the original point of the scheme and better promote recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Waste charging is only one of the many ways to reduce waste and waste treatment is a worldwide problem," he said. "One important thing is that we have to put more recycling facilities, more recycling points and shops so that we can push up recycling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said she supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”. But Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday were largely sympathetic towards the decision to suspend the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br>
  <br>
   Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the Legislative Council, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the ultimate goal of the scheme was to promote recycling and reduce waste, but he acknowledged the public had misconceptions about the plan.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "The public misunderstood that this whole thing is actually tantamount to a poll tax, which means that everyone has to start paying more taxes because everyone needs to generate garbage," he explained.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Most people are not aware of the fact that, no - that is not the end game. The end game is to reduce wastage generation. To do that, you need to do the wastage collection, the separation, so that some can be recycled. The whole world is doing that, and I cannot believe Hong Kong should just surrender and forget it."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We insist the policy should be carried out because it is environmental protection. We feel disappointed that [over] the last two years the government [had inadequate] preparation to implement the policy," he added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quat urged the government to continue educating the public and to provide support for the city's recycling industry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I think now is a very good timing for the government to promote recycling and the reduction of waste. Because going through all this education process, a lot of citizens think that they support environmental protection and they want to participate in waste reduction," she added.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Quat also suggested the government introduce additional incentives, such as a rewards scheme, to encourage people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle.

 Fans of the Japanese anime character Doraemon can now catch the time-travelling robot cat on some trains, as well as at the Siu Hong Light Rail stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leading up to the Doraemon exhibition on July 13 at the Avenue of Stars, the MTR Corporation has put up posters and decorations from the series at the stop, and has transformed some Light Rail, East Rail Line and Airport Express trains with the Doraemon theme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trains are covered in Doraemon blue, while the doors are pink to depict the "Anywhere Door" portal to any destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam, speaking for the organisers of the Doraemon event, said he hopes people can enjoy the iconic character during their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Doraemon is everyone's friend. We want to bring more joy and more creativity to people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "MTR is one of the important daily [modes of] transportation in Hong Kong, so when people can see it everyday, we are happy to share the joy with everybody. Of course, people can also catch the train to our exhibition."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police have arrested 20 people after a gang allegedly gave foreign domestic helpers cash to open bank accounts used to process HK$10 million in criminal proceeds.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Among the suspects picked up on suspicion of conspiracy to launder money were 14 Indonesian migrant workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A helper is suspected of having acted as an intermediary for a syndicate to recruit others, with meetings arranged at locations such as parks, fast food restaurants and hotel rooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Monday said they believe the helpers were paid between HK$1,000 and HK$2,500 for opening accounts, which were then managed by the syndicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For foreign domestic workers, the amount [allegedly] paid is relatively high compared to their salaries. That also was the main incentive for them to [allegedly] sell their bank accounts," said Chief Inspector So Chi-bing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank accounts are suspected of being linked to 39 cases of fraud involving losses of HK$5.4 million, police added.

 RTHK announced on Monday that the broadcaster will join hands with Guangdong Radio and Television station (GRT) to produce various sports programmes including a documentary on legendary football players in both places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two stations also agreed to play each other's programmes about the upcoming Paris Olympics in order to broaden the audience's horizons and promote interactive exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy director for broadcasting, Christine Wai, signed a memorandum of understanding with the head of GRT's sports channel in Shenzhen on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "RTHK has been actively promoting cooperation and exchanges with various media organisations on the mainland. In addition to sports, we have also collaborated on television programmes that promote Chinese history and culture, and foster a sense of patriotism. These efforts aim to help Hong Kong people integrate into the overall development of the country and cultivate a sense of national identity," Wai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of GRT, Zhong Shixun, said the new agreement would bring high-quality development cooperation and initiate new collaborative projects that will bring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes.

    Taxi union demands ban on unlicensed ride services

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport workers’ union on Monday called on the government to ban unlicensed ride-hailing services and address the plight of the taxi trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union said cab drivers have suffered a more than 30 percent drop in business in recent years due to competition with illegal taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos circulating online appear to show cabbies posing as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has urged people to leave such matters to law enforcement agencies, but the union’s principal vice-chairperson, Chong Wing-tak, said taxi drivers are not convinced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do drivers perform sting operations? It's because of a lack of enforcement action by the government, transport authorities, and the police. We have endured this for more than ten years. We can't bear it anymore, so some drivers have organised these sting operations," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Ho, the union's director of the taxi driver branch, described illegal cab drivers as "irresponsible", noting that any injuries that occur during unlicensed ride-hailing services are not covered by insurance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Transport and Logistics Bureau is expected to report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted the limited coverage of recycling facilities, pointing out that the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also said the scheme had increased the workload and pressure on cleaners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong's economic recovery had not lived up to expectations and the implementation of the scheme could have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also addressed the misconception that the government's aim with the waste charging scheme was to generate more revenue. He clarified that the primary objective of the scheme was to improve waste management practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of these factors, the government had taken the decision to shelve the waste charging scheme, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed the government remained committed to improving waste management and recycling practices in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government would step up publicity work to raise awareness of waste management and improve the city’s recycling network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to report back to Legco on its work by the middle of next year, he said.

    Minimum wage formula not lopsided: labour chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun says the administration has to help low-income workers who don't have a lot of bargaining power. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754864_1_20240527142045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Monday brushed aside concerns that a new mechanism for setting the statutory minimum wage was unfair to employers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Executive Council approved recommendations to review the minimum wage annually instead of every two years. There would also be a new formula for calculating the hourly pay rate, which bars any reduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmakers representing the business sector said the new mechanism only focuses on employees and gives workers the false hope of an annual pay rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, in response, said there is a need to help 17,000 low-income workers, who only account for 0.6 percent of the workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have very little bargaining power under the market mechanism. There are a lot of constraints on these workers, be it their abilities and other reasons, it is difficult for them to earn a decent pay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to reassure them that their wages would only go up rather than down. If they have to worry about the prospects of a wage cut, then it would add to their plight."

    Divided views on future of waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police are investigating the death on Sunday of a cyclist in a village near Tai Po who apparently lost control of her bicycle while riding downhill.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 30-year-old woman was riding down Tai Mei Tuk Road towards Tai Mei Tuk town centre at around 7pm when she rammed into a drop barrier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was taken unconscious to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital in Tai Po, where she was declared dead about an hour after the crash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The New Territories North special traffic investigations team is looking into the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tai Mei Tuk is a popular destination for cyclists and hikers, located on the edge of the Plover Clove reservoir and country park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, officers in Kowloon West are continuing to look into the deaths of a motorcycle rider and his passenger in Mong Kok in the early hours of Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 22-year-old motorcyclist and a 24-year-old woman were on a motorbike that collided with a taxi at the junction of Argyle Street and Nathan Road.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The taxi driver, 27, suffered limb injuries along with his 38-year-old passenger. A 69-year-old man who was walking past the scene suffered facial injuries from flying fragments in the crash. All three men required hospital treatment.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An alliance of six NGOs supporting street sleepers on Sunday called on Hongkongers to show more compassion for the homeless.
 <br>
  <br>
   The Homeless Alliance said there is less negativity shown towards street sleepers nowadays, but there is still room for the public to better understand their plight.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The alliance held a fair on Sunday and invited people to sit in a demonstration set-up of cardboards and umbrellas to experience homelessness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There were also sharing sessions where current and former street sleepers shared their life stories.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A former homeless person, Siu-hing, said she was happy to tell people about herself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I hope people will not look at homeless people with prejudice," she told RTHK. "I've had it rough."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Chi-keung, who said he was a big spender before becoming homeless, said he hopes people can learn from his experience.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "People who become homeless all have their stories, I'm sharing mine so people will be alert," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Isaac Ho, who works for ImpactHK – one of the six NGOs in the alliance – said fair participants can also learn how to communicate with the underprivileged.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "Don't miss the self-introduction when you approach them, let them know you're here as a human being to care for another human being," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   He urged the government to devise policies to support those who’re homeless, including having a longer notice period before cleaning the streets, and arranging housing for them in the long run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "If we want to tackle [homelessness], we give them a home to live first. And then medical, social counseling, employment services can also be delivered to them. Sleeping in a more stable and safe environment is the foundation of change."

    'Fire safety inspections beefed up after Jordan blaze'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Andy Yeung says the Fire Services Department has improved its inspection mechanism after the Jordan fire. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754751_2_20240526160543.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said officials have stepped up inspections of old buildings following a deadly blaze at a residential building in Jordan last month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On April 10, a No.3 alarm fire which broke out in New Lucky House killed five people and injured around 40 others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TVB programme, Yeung said preliminary investigation showed that some of the fire doors were open, which might have led to heavy smoke in one of the staircases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said the Fire Services Department has since improved its inspection mechanism, with priority being given to old buildings and those for commercial use.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We use a risk-based inspection mechanism which decides how often a building should be checked each year based on how risky it is,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “After the fire in New Lucky House, we adjusted the mechanism to prioritise inspections of old buildings and commercial premises, hoping to eliminate fire hazards as soon as possible.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said 2,000 inspections had been carried out and around 600 fire hazard abatement notices had been issued in the past month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire services director also noted that an amendment bill will be tabled to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sources say the government will shelve its plan to introduce a citywide waste charging scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The arrangement was originally scheduled to come into effect from August 1, but sources say the government will inform the Legislative Council on Monday of its plan to put it on the back-burner indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who's also chairman of Legco's Panel on Environmental Affairs, welcomed the news, saying this is not the right time to introduce the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials should consider a number of factors, such as the state of the city's economy and the availability of recycling services, before deciding when to bring back the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added that he believes the government will continue to step up education and promotional efforts on waste reduction to boost the community’s understanding of the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said he would be "very disappointed" if the scheme is to be shelved indefinitely.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong is facing a very serious waste crisis, and called on lawmakers not to overexaggerate the scheme's impact on the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Please do not blow up part of the community's negative response or comment. The effects of the financial burden mentioned by some of the political parties only affect some of the sectors of the community," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government has already delayed the waste charging scheme twice in the past... the authorities should treat this law seriously and give the public the timeline for rolling out the scheme."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The convenor of a community project to support carers on Sunday said nine carer spaces will be set up across the city to identify caregivers and address their plight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Patrick Nip, convenor of the Advisory Committee of the Jockey Club Carer Space Project, said Hong Kong’s ageing population is a growing cause for concern.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip noted that some 240,000 people are providing long-term care for around 300,000 elderly citizens in the community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Nip said it's important to remind carers to take care of their own mental health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we strengthen support for carers and remind them that they have their own needs too? Some don't see themselves as carers because they think it's their duty. Others might not be aware of their own mental state - even when they're on the verge of collapse. So I think an assessment is needed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The carer spaces, located in Sheung Shui, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Kwai Fong, Tsing Yi, Tai Wai, Shek Kip Mei, Sai Wan Ho and Sham Shui Po, will provide counselling and assessment services for carers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Daytime respite services for the elderly will also be available at a cost of HK$30 for four hours, with exemptions for those facing financial difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nip, a former government official, said the five-year project is expected to benefit around 27,000 carers and 15,000 care recipients.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the ultimate goal is to create a viable model for the administration to consider going forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most importantly, we hope to innovate boldly and try to find a feasible model in this pilot project. It can be replicated on a large scale, so the government can take over and it can be sustained. This is our goal," he explained.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said talks he held during his trip to Paris showed that these visits were conducive to helping others better understand the SAR's development, and clearing up misunderstandings.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, the minister said he had been promoting the SAR's advantages to political and business leaders in France, and they were highly interested in the city’s latest developments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some meeting participants told us that it was very important for the SAR government to actively go out and contact friends from different sectors," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said people he met during his French visit agreed that the SAR remains highly promising, with some describing the city as being as vibrant and charismatic as it was before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that he had been fostering exchanges between the two places in the business and cultural arenas, noting that he invited the organiser of a French tech conference, VivaTech, as well as the Théâtre National de Chaillot, to come to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said he will be leaving for San Francisco on Monday to promote cooperation between China and the United States in dealing with climate change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the current geopolitical situation is complicated, addressing climate change is the responsibility of the whole world. Countries must establish a stronger foundation for cooperation and smoother communication channels, so that the world can have a greater chance of success in moving towards zero carbon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said Hong Kong is sparing no efforts in becoming an international hub of green technology and finance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that he and other representatives will be sharing the SAR's knowledge and experience in developing a sustainable future in the Bay to Bay Dialogue and the US-China High-Level Event on Subnational Climate Action.

 Police on Sunday appealed to witnesses to a fatal traffic accident overnight to come forward.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Fans of the time-travelling robot cat Doraemon on Saturday got a sneak preview of a forthcoming exhibition, as crowds gathered along Victoria Harbour for the world's first-ever drone show devoted to the beloved Japanese animated character.
 <br>
  <br>
   The display lasted for more than 10 minutes with large crowds filling the Avenue of Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Some people that RTHK spoke to said that the drone show was exciting, while others thought it was a little too short.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Saurabh Agarwal said he really enjoyed the accompanying sound and picture performance with his friends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It was fantastic. We waited for more than an hour, and it was worth the wait. We actually missed the last show for drones," he said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This time we just came early to get a good place. This was fantastic and it was the first time I see drones in Hong Kong so I was very excited."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I really enjoyed it. It was brilliant. The drones performed brilliantly. I don't know anything about the cartoon character, but I really enjoyed the show," said Debra Gergson, who is visiting Hong Kong on vacation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Puneet Brar said she wished the show could have been longer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "We really enjoyed the show and the graphics. It was an amazing production. I wish it was a little longer because I was enjoying myself a lot," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "I thought it was really special and unique. You just can't see a drone show everyday."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Earlier in the morning, visitors got to see dozens of huge models from the series at Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park in Sai Ying Pun.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A woman, surnamed Chan, was among those who went to see the Doraemon figures.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "This is so cute. The character is part of the childhood memories of many people, so it's very attractive," she said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "It would be nice to have a longer exhibition or displays around different parts of Hong Kong... so that adults and kids can all come and take photos."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Free Doraemon balloons were also handed out in several busy districts in Hong Kong, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, Causeway Bay and Central, with most of them distributed in about two hours.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The full exhibition, the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar," gets under way on July 13 and runs until August 4, featuring a special animated short film.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   S K Lam from the event organiser said the film depicts one of the characters, Gian, mostly known for being an aggressive bully in the series, holding a concert in Hong Kong.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The film will be part of the paid exhibition, but fans can also visit large-scale figures of Doraemon for free at the Avenue of Stars.

    Runaway emu shocks passers-by in Tin Shui Wai

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A rogue emu was spotted pounding the streets of Tin Shui Wai on Saturday morning, shocking residents and rapidly going viral on social media.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Emus are normally found in the Australian outback, rather than Hong Kong public housing estates, but video widely shared online showed one of the flightless birds exploring different parts of the town in the northern New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aside from the estate, the emu was spotted running up and down busy roads, at one point forcing a lorry driver to slam on the breaks to avoid a collision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After calls from people who saw the runaway at the junction of Tin Sau Road and Tin Ying Road, inspectors from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals moved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were joined in the search by police officers and officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About three hours later, the emu found its way into the nearby wetlands park, where it was caught, uninjured, and handed over to the AFCD for safekeeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials say they've so far been unable to contact the farm the emu came from.

    Wide range of mega events a must for HK: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should not limit the kind of mega events it stages, culture, sports and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said on Saturday, dismissing concerns that an abundance of shows and exhibitions could diminish their appeal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The SAR has more than 100 mega events scheduled for the latter half of this year, from sporting contests to summits, but lawmaker Doreen Kong earlier said she's worried that too many big events would lead to a loss of focus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Yeung said diversity was important to cater to different audiences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For tourists, they may be travelling to Hong Kong for a week to participate in a mega event they are interested in...But in Hong Kong, it does seem that 200 mega events are a lot, with all sorts of shows and activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that Hong Kong is a diverse place with many mega events, and different people who come here can find what they want to take part in. We also want to let everyone know that Hong Kong is capable and has hosted various types of mega events."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year's mega events are expected to draw 1.7 million visitors, out of a predicted 46 million total arrivals. But the minister stressed that mega events were not the only away to attract tourists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not solely rely on one aspect to attract people. We already have a number of projects, for example, existing tourist hotspots and in-depth tours. The estimated figure also do not include the number of people attending concerts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we shouldn't only look at the mega events on the roster. It's more about the atmosphere of the city after holding mega events, and making the city more attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said the administration was in talks with the filmmakers behind the hit local movie "Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In" about turning its set into a tourist site. The film attracted a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival and has sparked international interest in its setting: the long-demolished Kowloon Walled City.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister also acknowledged the possibility of the filmmakers requiring the sets again to produce a prequel or sequel to the martial arts film.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmaker Tony Tse says building owners, like those at New Lucky House in Jordan, should be told that they are responsible for the premises' maintenance and repair. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754648_1_20240525111952.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Increasing penalties alone will not be enough to deal with the problem of property owners ignoring fire safety orders, a lawmaker said on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse made the comments after the government said this week that it intended to submit an amendment bill to the Legislative Council in July to raise the penalties for people who ignore such instructions. It follows the deaths of five people in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan, a building subject to a series of fire safety notices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials are proposing to raise the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tony Tse, who represents the architectural, surveying, planning and landscape sectors, said legislation alone was not the answer and that owners should be informed that they are responsible for carrying out maintenance and repair work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[For] those who have little knowledge or no knowledge about this area, we should all offer some sort of assistance. That could be coming from the government, or some professional institutions, as well as some volunteering persons who have knowledge about it," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Andrew Lam said that while it's "inevitable" that stricter penalties for non-compliance would be introduced, the government should strengthen inter-departmental cooperation to tackle such issues.

 The group behind a 2019 protest song that's subject to a court injunction said on Friday evening that the distributor had now decided to remove it from all platforms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On social media, the group behind "Glory to Hong Kong" said it has expressed opposition to the decision, saying it hoped to have the song reinstated as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group said the song had been removed from iTunes and Apple Music in various regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Court of Appeal earlier granted a government request for a temporary injunction against anyone playing or performing the song with seditious intent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, has since restricted the viewing of 32 links related to the song in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau says claims that Hong Kong was no longer the Pearl of the Orient and its status has been overtaken by Singapore were absolutely not true, citing the SAR’s unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “I think it’s not true at all. Hong Kong has the advantage over the others because we have the back-up of the motherland. We are a super connector and a value adder,” Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary for commerce and economic development said Hong Kong is positioned to capture business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, which has a population of 86 million with GDP of US$1.3 trillion. The size of the GBA economy is comparable to that of South Korea or some northern European countries, Yau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Using Hong Kong as a gateway going into the Greater Bay Area is our advantage,” Yau told RTHK’s Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted that Hong Kong is the only common law city in China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The rule of law, free low of capital, good infrastructure and professional services… are all available in Hong Kong which are very competitive to any other economy in the world,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To attract more foreign businesses to operate in Hong Kong, Yau said, “We need to change”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister hailed a business trip led by the Chief Executive John Lee to the Middle East and Asean countries last year, adding that Hong Kong businesses need to look at how to accommodate new investors coming from those parts of the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The whole world is changing, the situation is evolving and we have to look at new opportunities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Without changing, we won’t be able to entertain the new investors, visitors or tourists coming from the Middle East especially,” the secretary said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau also revealed that Hong Kong will be hosting a Belt and Road summit in September as part of a month-long Belt and Road festival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister, whose policy portfolio also covers broadcasting, said he is trying to foster a more dynamic environment for the industry. He said there are more programmes on RTHK about education and culture on the mainland.

    US sanctions will have no impact on DoJ: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Justice Paul Lam on Friday said any US sanctions aimed at Hong Kong judges and officials will have no impact on the Department of Justice.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam's comment came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was taking steps to impose new visa restrictions on a number of SAR officials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blinken said this was in response to what he described as "an intensifying crackdown on rights and freedoms" in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on his return from an official visit to the Middle East, Lam reiterated his opposition to any such sanctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As we have reiterated many times, these actions and statements violate fundamental principles of international law. Secondly, these remarks or expressions will absolutely not affect me personally or the work of our Department of Justice. They will not have the slightest impact whatsoever," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The justice chief also said he explained Hong Kong's common law system to the business sector in the Middle East during his five-day trip there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said there are many opportunities for cooperation between Hong Kong and the Middle East, as the SAR can help connect investors and businesspeople there to China and the rest of the world.

    Lawmakers differ on pushing or shelving waste charging

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Friday were divided on the way forward for the planned citywide waste charging scheme, with one believing the policy should not go to waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a paper to the Legislative Council, the administration said people who took part in a trial believed the measure was causing a nuisance to the public and complained the designated bags would be too expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Legislator Tik Chi-yuen, from the Third Side, said the city should continue pushing for the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have sufficient conditions to continue with the plan. It doesn't matter what the policy will be called, whether it's a second phase of the trial, or operating it in different modes," Tik told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should introduce this scheme to places with management capabilities, including public housing, subsidised housing, large-scale private residential estates, as well as premises of the government and the public sector."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But DAB lawmaker, Edward Lau, said the government should shelve the waste charging scheme "indefinitely". He said introducing the policy on schedule would cause chaos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should hold off on introducing the scheme and look into areas that should be improved. That's because many issues were reflected in the report and it's impossible to fail to deal with them," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Only when conditions permit and the timing is right, then the government can bring it back to Legco for discussions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwok Wai-keung from the Federation of Trade Unions said it could be worth amending the time frame in which to roll out the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other than strengthening our recycling facilities, we hope the government can provide a detailed timetable. If we are going to carry out works on waste charging and reduction, the government should say how many stages should there be," Kwok said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said there should be a test run for everyone to take part in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Friday said a number of people who trialled the pay-as-you-throw scheme think the government should hold off on rolling out the plan to everyone in August, believing the measure was causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But in a paper submitted to the Legislative Council, the Environment and Ecology Bureau gave no indication of what would be next for the municipal solid waste charging scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials began trialling the scheme at 14 locations from April, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the bags were used 70 percent of the time at shopping malls participating in the test run, but there were fewer residents who used them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The average usage rate [of designated bags] at public and private housing buildings ranged from only about 20 percent to more than 50 percent, and only around 20 percent at 'three-nil' buildings," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A "three-nil" building is one which does not have an owners' corporation or any form of residents' organisation, nor does it employ a property management company to manage the building.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said many residents thought charging for disposed waste was causing a nuisance and complained the bags would be too expensive, while voicing concerns that littering would happen more often once the measure took effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some also believed it was difficult to understand how to dispose of items larger than the designated bags, the bureau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Residents polled] suggested to scrap waste charging or let society fully understand and prepare for it, thus it is not appropriate to introduce the scheme as scheduled on August 1," the paper said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau noted that frontline cleaning staff had seen their workload increase from handling trash that was not thrown out properly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some expressed a concern about conflicts with residents when the policy was introduced or even breaking the law unknowingly, with certain individuals planning to quit because of the scheme, officials said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For restaurants, shops and care homes, they pointed to a rise in operating costs and recommended improving the design of larger garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration said certain locations, such as residential blocks, care homes, restaurants and government premises, saw a 10 to 20 percent decrease in the amount of garbage disposed during the test run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added there was a rise in the type and amount of recyclables collected.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association on Friday said its chairwoman, Josephine Ip, has resigned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On its website, the association said Ip's move was down to personal reasons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  First vice-chairman Yu Sum-por will take over from Ip.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC) said it is aware of Ip's resignation and respects the decision made by her and the association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, the SAR government twice criticised Ip for remarks she made in public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, she said an event featuring competitors representing the Hong Kong SAR and Chinese Taipei had lifters from "13 countries".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another incident, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a slip of the tongue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports, and Tourism Bureau on Friday expressed its gratitude to the SF&OC for addressing Ip's blunders, which it described as "completely unacceptable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau again urged the SF&OC to enhance training for its affiliates, to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    DAB calls on govt to shelve waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Friday called on the government to shelve plans to roll out household waste charging, saying surveys it has carried out show this is what the majority of people want.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It added that authorities should not see the policy as the only means to reduce waste.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said only 18.4 percent of 810 people it polled by phone in April thought the pay-as-you-throw scheme should go ahead as planned in August, and only 15 percent of 750 people polled in May thought the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around 30 percent of the interviewees said the policy should be delayed a third time, while 45 percent said it should be scrapped entirely, the DAB said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The party said people feel there are not enough recycling facilities, and that having to pay for designated bags for waste would be a financial burden.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said authorities should take more time to help Hong Kong get ready for the scheme, by building waste-to-energy infrastructure, setting up more recycling stations across the city and providing detailed recycling guidelines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the administration can also provide cash rewards for those who recycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have a reward scheme to encourage citizens to [recycle] but now the scheme is that you do recycling and then you get some points, which can be used to redeem noodles or oil, that kind of thing. I think if you can redeem cash, you will have a better incentive," Quat said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said earlier in the week that even though the pay-as-you-go measure was made law by the previous administration, authorities should still put thought into how the scheme is executed.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Thursday said an outbreak of gastroenteritis at the Eastern Hospital has affected at least 43 staff members.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The CHP said the outbreak was likely caused by environmental contamination or person-to-person transmission of norovirus, noting that more than half of the affected staff members work in the East Block of the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It has ordered the hospital to disinfect the area immediately, along with other places the workers visited.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the Hospital Authority earlier said some affected workers had consumed food from two hospital canteens, the CHP said not all of them had done so. It added that its officers did not find any irregularities when they inspected the cafeterias.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patients, aged between 20 and 62, are all in stable condition, the CHP added.

 The Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) on Thursday confirmed that Kam Kee Catering Group has failed to settle around HK$3.1 million in MPF contributions and relevant surcharges.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the restaurant chain did not make MPF contributions for around 980 employees between February and March this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MPFA on Wednesday filed a lawsuit in the High Court against the company, on behalf of affected employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority reminded employers that it is their legal responsibility to make MPF contributions on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department, meanwhile, said it is handling claims of unpaid salaries and other legal matters from around 60 Kam Kee employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on other workers to get in touch if they have any queries or concerns.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Authorities on Thursday said a makeover of Sham Shui Po's fabric market could attract young designers and tourists to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Sham Shui Po Fabric Market relocated to Tung Chau Street from Yen Chow Street Hawker Bazaar last year to make way for public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The market currently has space for 50 stalls with 30 currently in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The district officer of Sham Shui Po, Paul Wong, said that bright orange reflective panels that had been installed at the venue represent hope for the fashion and design industry in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you're interested in fashion design and DIYs, Sham Shui Po has been your dream destination for many years. Giving these new destinations a push, we can attract more young designers or people who are interested in the design creative industry to come to Sham Shui Po to mingle with other designers and take inspiration," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the beautification project, which they have dubbed "Fabrimark", would bring more exposure and business to the market, while maintaining the textile trade's heritage and history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a strong and long heritage of textile and clothing industry in Sham Shui Po, so riding on the opening of the Hong Kong Design Centre in the fourth quarter of this year, we think this is a good opportunity to combine the new development and our heritage to showcase the fashion design industry, the design industry in general and the textile and clothing heritage of Sham Shui Po."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong also said the beautification work would last around nine months, costing approximately HK$50,000 per month, adding there was an opportunity for an extension depending on its maintenance.

    Drainage Services steps up flood prevention efforts

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Drainage Services Department is building a 64,000 cubic metre water storage tank in Kwun Tong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Drainage Services Department said it was taking proactive measures to mitigate the risk of flooding as the rainy season approaches.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a press briefing on Thursday, the department stressed that flooding cannot be totally be avoided due to climate change but said it would adopt a multi-pronged approach to reduce the risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Besides more frequent inspections of the drainage system, it also plans to use artificial intelligence in more scenarios, such as deploying AI-powered robots to clear obstructions in drains and manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Director of Drainage Services Ringo Mok also said the department was developing an AI analysis tool to gather rainstorm data to help predict floods in future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are collaborating with a university team…we need to collect a large amount of data on site to train the computer, to recognise flooding and also to predict it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having to collect the information from [the Hong Kong Observatory] from the coming rainstorm data, we hope the AI model can predict the water depth in the near future during the rainstorms.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a demonstration for the media, the department also showcased the construction progress of a storm water storage tank on Sau Nga Road in Kwun Tong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tank is capable of storing around 64,000 cubic metres of water, which is equivalent to 26 standard swimming pools, and is part of a major project to improve drainage in the surrounding area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HK$930 million water storage tank was expected to be completed in 2028 and Mok said the price tag was reasonable given the scale and complexity of the project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the heavy rainfall, we need to temporarily store the rainwater in the storage tank and wait until the bad weather and the heavy rainfall has gone,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We will discharge the rainwater subsequently when the rainfall intensity has reduced…because of the quite large volume of the excavation and the quite large volume of the tank, the cost of the storage scheme is at that level.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the department’s ongoing review of flooding black spots would be completed by the end of the year.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Precious Blood Hospital in Sham Shui Po said on Thursday that the institution will remain non-profit making despite its decision to partner up with a private medical group to expand services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Catholic charity Caritas said it will work with Parkway Medical Services to redevelop and expand the 87-year-old hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Joseph Lui, director of medical services at Caritas, said the hospital will remain a Catholic institution, upholding its religious values and mission to serve the local community and the needy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Kenneth Tsang, CEO of Parkway, said new services at the hospital will focus on meeting the needs of the growing elderly population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because the community, not just for Sham Shui Po but for the whole of Hong Kong, is becoming more and more of an elderly population. More than 20 percent of our population is elderly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So the focus of the hospital will really be on what the people of Hong Kong need. The 20 percent of people who are old, they may have eye problems, they may have ear problems, they may have problems related to the deterioration of age. So those are all the areas that we're going to focus on in the hospital."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital was established by the Sisters of the Precious Blood during the Second World War to provide medical care to the sick and injured.

    Study shows Chinese calligraphy promotes brain health

Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754363_1_20240523132205.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University study on Thursday showed that practising Chinese calligraphy can promote brain health, with researchers recommending that people be encouraged to take part in more cognitive activity to prevent dementia.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The study involved more than 100 people aged between 55 and 75 who had been practising Chinese calligraphy for an hour a week for a decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of the participants doubled their practice time during the study, and the researchers found significant improvements in their brain network connectivity and memory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psychiatrist Allen Lee, who led the research, explained why Chinese calligraphy can stimulate brain function.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you practise, you use your memory because you have to remember the words. You have to pay attention to what you are writing, and you have to have good eye and hand coordination," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You check your work. If you have the chance to practise again, how would you improve it? So you have that kind of reflection."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also suggested that other cognitive activities, such as reading and playing chess or mahjong, have similar benefits, making them a valuable lifestyle intervention to prevent dementia in Hong Kong's ageing population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The risk of developing dementia increases with age. So it's really important that not only older adults, but even those who are now in middle age, start to be aware of the importance of cognitive activities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want people to be aware of brain health and find ways to help themselves to prevent or slow down the risk of developing dementia."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The organiser of the world’s first Doraemon drone show said it’s no coincidence that Hong Kong was chosen as the launchpad for the event.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A 15-minute drone show will light up Victoria Harbour this Saturday night, serving as a prelude to an exhibition about the beloved Japanese cartoon series in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The exhibition is also the first stop on a global tour and also listed on the government's "mega events calendar".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from AllRightsReserved told RTHK on Thursday that Hong Kong's multi-generational Doraemon fans impressed him and noted that a similar exhibition held here 12 years ago played a key role in this decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Twelve years ago I saw many four-generation families coming to the exhibition. The previous exhibition had exceeded expectations. We didn't even have the term 'mega event' back then, but the exhibition attracted a significant number of tourists specifically for Doraemon. It was truly impressive,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I would say it’s like ‘the seeds were planted’ 12 years ago, and what we want is to come back to Hong Kong this time, to show appreciation for this place and also the fans.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Japan, Thailand and the mainland were also considered for the first stop of the global tour but Hong Kong eventually stood out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam didn’t give an exact number of estimated visitors to the exhibition but hopes that it could help boost the local economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council on Wednesday passed an amendment bill to the city’s wildlife protection law, raising the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals to HK$100,000 and a one-year jail term.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Wild Animals Protection (Amendment) Bill also includes a new fixed penalty for illegal animal feeding, at HK$5,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And the ban on illegal feeding would be expanded to cover feral pigeons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, the maximum penalty for illegally feeding wild animals is a fine of HK$10,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amendments, which will take effect from August 1, are aimed at boosting deterrence against illegal feeding activities in the SAR, protecting wild animals and improving environmental hygiene.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the bill, the scope of government enforcement officers has expanded,” Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Together with various enforcement departments, a guideline has been put in place, and there will also be comprehensive training to cover identification of wild animals and process, as well as the standards of evidence collection.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that joint departmental operations will be arranged if necessary to ensure the effectiveness and consistency of law enforcement, and authorities will continue installing CCTV cameras at “black spots”.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan began a 10-day trip to France and the US on Wednesday, in a joint business trip with delegates from Macau and the Guangdong provincial government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During their stay in the French capital of Paris, they will attend the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and Europe (France) Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference, to promote business opportunities in the bay area, as well as Hong Kong’s role as a “super connector” and “super value-adder”.

  The finance minister will also meet the local political and business communities to explore opportunities for greater collaboration between Hong Kong and France.
  <br/>

  The group will then fly to California and visit San Francisco and Berkeley, where they will attend a Bay-to-Bay Dialogue, as well as a high-level event on the climate, next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan will attend a business luncheon organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in California’s bay area, to attract US firms to Hong Kong, especially those in the innovation and technology sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those joining the trip are the SAR’s commerce minister Algernon Yau, transport chief Lam Sai-hung, Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury Joseph Chan, and the Greater Bay Area development commissioner Maisie Chan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan will return to the city on June 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong will be Acting Financial Secretary during Chan’s absence.

 Around 1,000 drones will light up the sky over Victoria Harbour this Saturday in the world's first Doraemon drone show.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 15-minute show will feature characters from the popular Japanese cartoon series as well as Doraemon's gadgets, such as the Anywhere Door and the Take-Copter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam from the event organiser, AllRightsReserved, told RTHK that Doraemon holds a special place in the hearts of people from different generations, as it's a character that brings back cherished childhood memories for many.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the drones will tell a story accompanied by the voices of Hong Kong's dubbing artists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drone show is a prelude to a larger Doraemon and Friends exhibition in July.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of paddlers are to make a splash in Victoria Harbour during next month’s Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races, with the event expected to draw crowds of spectators.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The races, jointly organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong China Dragon Boat Association, will be held on June 15 and 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 athletes from a dozen countries and regions, including China, Thailand and Singapore, will take part. Teams from the Hong Kong and Macau SARs will also compete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants this year will also have a chance to join special races commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism body will also host a drone show for the Tuen Ng Festival and a pyrotechnic display on the first evening of the races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The whole event, we believe, would help to enable our Hong Kong community, our residents, as well as our tourists [to have a] tremendous, happy and interesting experience,” said the board’s executive director Dane Cheng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We expect it would draw around 130,000 visitors and patrons to this event, and together, we would be hoping that everyone would enjoy and have a good time.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheng said the festivities, including the races and other shows, carry a price tag of HK$17 million.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police said they arrested 100 people who were allegedly involved in cases of fraud and money laundering.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 17 and 75, were involved in 82 cases related to investments, online employment and online romance scams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the cases involved a total of HK$180 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief inspector Cheng Ki-fung said the suspects were mostly stooge account holders of syndicates, who were responsible for collecting or managing the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said one of the cases involved 54 victims who had bought coupons online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The suspects employed many different defrauding tricks. Different kinds of coupons appeared in different cases. They also sold different coupons during different festivals," Cheng said.

    Worldcoin ordered to get its eyes off Hongkongers

<div class="itemFullText">
 Cryptocurrency project Worldcoin has been ordered to cease operations in Hong Kong after breaching privacy rules through its iris scans and collection of face images, authorities said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner launched a probe into Worldcoin after raiding six of its premises around Hong Kong in January.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project, founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, provides a digital passport with free Worldcoin cryptocurrency tokens, but participants first have to have their faces and eyeballs scanned to verify they are human and unique.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 8,300 people in Hong Kong signed up, but many didn't know what they were agreeing to and the data taken from them was unnecessary and excessive, said Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) Ada Chung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Worldcoin was found to have breached several parts of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, including by failing to explain to participants the risks regarding disclosure of their biometric data and by planning to keep personal information for up to 10 years in order to use it to train artificial intelligence models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy commissioner said another breach was that Worldcoin did not provide information to participants in Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The PCPD was of the view that participants using Chinese as native language would not be able to clearly understand the relevant policies and practices, terms and conditions of the Worldcoin project, and hence there was a lack of transparency."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said members of the public should contact it immediately if they find that Worldcoin is continuing to carry out iris-scanning in the territory.

    MTR projects up for tender again

<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the MTR Corporation on Wednesday said the railway giant had been successful in its recent property sales with the market picking up, adding the Tung Chung East project would be tendered again, after the rail firm failed to receive any bids last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rex Auyeung and Jacob Kam, the firm’s CEO, were speaking to reporters ahead of the company's annual general meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Tung Chung East Station development project will be tendered again in the next 12 months. As for the Siu Ho Wan Depot Site project, we are carrying out preliminary work and we will announce tender details when we are ready," said Auyeung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Kam said last year's station flooding was due to the impact of flash flooding, not maintenance problems, adding the recently installed flood sensors at 26 stations would now allow for a prompt response by staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the railway operator had put measures in place for dealing with the upcoming typhoon season to ensure the safety of its staff and passengers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During typhoon [signal] No. 9 or above, all train services on the open sections will be suspended. Now, if there are still trains out there running on the open sections during the transition from typhoon 8 to typhoon 9 or above, we will of course try to continue those services already on the open sections to the original destination, or at least to the nearest stations with enough space to let the passengers off the trains so that they can stay in a safe place until the weather improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To do that, we have actually in place our train crew, our maintenance staff, and our station staff to be prepared for that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for plans by Shenzhen authorities to redevelop the control point at Lo Wu to allow for smoother connectivity between the two locations, Kam said the two sides were still discussing the details and the MTR would cooperate when a decision had been made.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk on Wednesday said the government expects to submit an amendment bill to Legco in July to raise the penalties for people who violate fire safety regulations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Five people were killed in a fire at New Lucky House in Jordan in April, sparking concerns about inadequate safety facilities in old buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco meeting, Cheuk said the authorities propose raising the maximum penalty by four times to HK$100,000 for those who fail to follow a fire safety direction, and to HK$200,000 for those who ignore compliance orders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said financial penalties alone would be ineffective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to imprison people to serve a deterrent effect because Hong Kong people don't care about fines, but they certainly don't want to be jailed," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said the authorities were looking into including more provisions, including jail terms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If someone tries to obstruct the owner's corporation to carry out repair works, is uncooperative or tries to obstruct certain work intentionally, we're considering whether to impose penalties including imprisonment," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Wednesday said the government would not comment on the death of a British man accused by the UK of spying for Hong Kong, while another official said the city’s overseas trade offices would continue their work to promote the SAR and facilitate trade and investment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They were speaking to reporters following a Legco antechamber meeting, after Matthew Trickett was found dead in a park west of London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett, who was 37, was one of three people arrested earlier this month and charged by UK authorities for allegedly helping to collect intelligence for Hong Kong. Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in London, is a co-defendant in the national security case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Bernard Chan declined to address questions on whether the ETO in London was monitoring the activities of HongKongers in the UK, saying officials would not address online rumours or baseless accusations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan stressed that the trade offices would continue to carry out their lawful duties undeterred.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The ETO’s task is to liaise with the local government, think tanks, different sectors and all walks of life to try to improve or facilitate or foster the cooperation on trade and investment, and also in the area of art and culture. We will continue to liaise with the local government to tell the good stories of Hong Kong,” he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's head judge on Wednesday said corruption erodes public faith in governments and the rule of law and discourages people from making investments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering a keynote speech at an anti-corruption symposium, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said corruption was "the misuse of power" that led to "some not being subject or held accountable under the same rules", placing them above the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption erodes public faith in governments and institutions, where the rule of law is built on public trust," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even the appearance of corruption, never mind corruption on a micro scale, will lead to the erosion of the public's belief in the rule of law. Therefore, if for no other reasons than the upholding of the rule of law in a society, it is vital that corruption be subject to continuing vigilance and efforts to combat it at all levels and in all forms."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also argued against claims there were potentially economic benefits to corruption, calling such views "exceedingly short-term and narrow".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Corruption is not merely the product of a bad institution, it actually helps create bad institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Investors are likely to be discouraged by corruption from making investments, as they would prefer fair, transparent and competitive markets in order to protect their capital."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong is at the forefront of the international fight against corruption, Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday, while vowing to sustain the territory's "pioneering role" in anti-graft work.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He also told the opening ceremony of a symposium in Wan Chai that the SAR has a clean and efficient government and zero tolerance for corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-day event, co-hosted by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities, attracted more than 500 participants, including anti-corruption experts, legal professionals and academics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong maintains a robust regulatory regime in line with international standards, and is renowned globally for its clean and efficient government, level-playing field for doing business, sound rule of law, a judiciary with independent judicial power, and zero tolerance for corruption," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the anti-corruption body had championed the fight against corruption in the city for half a century.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a priority of the Hong Kong SAR government to sustain our pioneering role in combating corruption. We are pleased and proud to back the ICAC in widening its international network and cooperating with overseas counterparts," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed, as well, to ensuring that our legal framework and anti-corruption institutions, as well as public and private sector governance, reflect the highest international obligations and standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Danny Woo, the commissioner of the anti-graft body, told the same event that the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption had organised 70 training courses for more than 40 agencies around the world since it was established in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said there would be a training programme on the use of innovation and technology to combat and prevent corruption following the symposium.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A unique feature of this training programme is a three-day study tour to the city of Changsha of China. Participants will witness first-hand China's latest development and anti-corruption initiative during the trip," Woo said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 British police are investigating the unexplained death of a man, who was charged earlier this month for allegedly helping Hong Kong authorities gather intelligence in the United Kingdom.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Matthew Trickett was due to appear in court on Friday to face charges under Britain's National Security Act.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  British police said Trickett, who was 37, was found dead in a park in Maidenhead, west of London, on Sunday afternoon after a report from a member of the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said an investigation was ongoing into the death and an autopsy would be conducted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trickett’s lawyer said he was "shocked" by the news and was supporting Trickett's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspect was a former Royal Marine who'd worked for the UK border force. He was also the director of a security consultancy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In early May, Trickett was arrested along with Peter Wai and Bill Yuen, the office manager of Hong Kong's Trade Office in London.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three men were granted bail and were due to appear in court on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When they were charged, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said it made serious representations to UK officials over the matter, saying it firmly rejected and strongly condemned "Britain's fabrication of the so-called case".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR Government, meanwhile, said it had "demanded the UK Government provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter. (Agencies)

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau has proposed that students taking the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education economics exam can skip part of the test from 2028.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It came after the bureau announced that students would be allowed to only take the compulsory test for the Chinese history DSE exam from 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a circular published on Monday, the bureau said the requirement for students to choose one of the elective tests would be removed for the economics DSE exam, and that students only sitting the compulsory paper would be rewarded a score of level 5 at most.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said this would allow students to focus on studying for the compulsory part of the exam to enhance learning effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the measure would be implemented at secondary 4 starting from the 2025-26 school year, and would apply to the 2028 DSE exams.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's business school on Tuesday said it was investigating "a small number of cases" in which people submitted forged documents to gain admission to the school.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said it had found that some agencies, which claimed to offer "guaranteed admission", had forged application documents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said it would not tolerate any acts of dishonesty or academic misconduct.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are committed to academic integrity and to creating a fair learning environment," the school said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "While we understand that securing a place in a top graduate programme is not easy, it is regrettable that this competition has attracted individuals who resort to deceitful means in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school said that if any of the cases were confirmed to be true, it would take the necessary disciplinary and legal action, including withdrawing offers of admission and referring the cases to the relevant authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One HKU student told RTHK she was surprised that some people could cheat their way into the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's shocking to me...it's quite unfair to other students who have worked very hard to get into the school, while others can just fake it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another student said the university should ensure fairness in admission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For future students who want to go to the university...the school needs to have a stricter process for checking their certificates," she said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory issued its Red Rainstorm Warning Signal at 2.50pm on Tuesday, after the amber signal had been in force for almost five hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The observatory said heavy rain was continuing to affect the city, and a band of thundery showers over the southern part of the territory was edging closer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the downpours were particularly heavy on Lantau, where there could be serious flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said more than 90 millimetres of hourly rainfall was recorded around noon in Cheung Sha on Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said the city's schools should ensure that conditions were safe before allowing students to leave for the day.
