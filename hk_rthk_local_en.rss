<div class="itemFullText">
 The nation's first homegrown passenger aircraft made its return to Hong Kong on Saturday to fly more than 100 university students for a visit to Shanghai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The C919 made its debut in the SAR in December, delighting spectators with a spectacular flypast over Victoria Harbour. This time it's serving a charter flight for participants in a youth internship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony at the airport, Chief Secretary Eric Chan welcomed the aircraft's return.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The C919 returns to Hong Kong today, taking young people in Hong Kong to Shanghai to experience life at a mainland airport," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, they will experience national affairs and development at first hand.I believe this experience will be unforgettable for all the students and will be useful for their lives."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students onboard the flight told RTHK that they were excited to learn more about the aviation industry on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to have this opportunity to take the first C919 flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Through this opportunity, I can learn more about the homegrown aircraft industry on the mainland," said one student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she hoped the seats would be comfy and wondered whether meals would be served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is my first time to take the domestically-made plane. I'm interested to know whether the facilities on the plane will be different than those from other countries," said another student.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Andrew Yao who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong-Shanghai Associations, said he hopes students can learn more about the development of the Belt and Road initiative through the internship programme.

    Working together will reduce waste in GBA: minister

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said a proposal to integrate waste management across the Greater Bay Area does not simply mean Hong Kong will send its rubbish for disposal across the border.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister confirmed that the authorities are mulling working with mainland counterparts on handling and recycling waste to achieve carbon neutrality and build a waste-free bay area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Tse said the plan is not to ship waste to the rest of the Greater Bay Area for incineration, but to recycle and reuse it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To achieve carbon neutrality, many countries have been promoting resource circulation. This concept is not difficult to understand. It simply means turning resources into products, such as the clothes you are wearing or the chair you are sitting on. It's not sustainable if all these products end up turning into garbage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added he is confident that Hong Kong will be able to deal with a daily average of around 11,000 tonnes of garbage after the territory's three incinerators are put into operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The waste integration proposal came after the SAR announced on Monday that it was shelving a territory-wide waste charging scheme for a third time. The minister reiterated that the move does not mean the government is pausing its waste reduction efforts.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Friday said it strongly disapproved and condemned the US Department of State for proposing visa restriction on Beijing and SAR officials responsible for implementing the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Washington said on Friday that it was taking steps to put the visa restrictions in place after the trial under the NSL of 47 people on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion. It gave no further details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two of the defendants were acquitted and fourteen were found guilty, with the remainder pleading guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a spokesman for the SAR government said: “The proposed imposition of the so-called 'visa restrictions' by the US Government smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate PRC and HKSAR officials who resolutely safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong's affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR despises such threat and will not be intimidated by such a despicable behaviour.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement added that the SAR would continue to do its duty in safeguarding national security, adding that the findings of the judges in the case on Wednesday “clearly confirmed that the criminal acts in the case aimed at undermining, destroying or overthrowing the existing political system and structure of the HKSAR established under the Basic Law and the 'one country, two systems' principle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Such criminal acts endangering national security had nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights,” the statement added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrics expert on Saturday said there's been no easing of the winter flu outbreak in Hong Kong, and he expects the situation to continue for several more weeks.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Patrick Ip from the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Hong Kong said the number of influenza cases would usually fall off in April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The condition of the influenza outbreak [had] been persistent throughout May, and we are expecting actually even in June, there will still be a few more weeks of influenza outbreak affecting many of our young children," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So far, we find most of those severe influenza cases, including the death cases, occur more dominantly in young children, particularly with those without any influenza vaccination."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged parents to get their children vaccinated. Four children have died of flu so far this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Friday that businesses he met on a visit to California only wanted to talk about the business environment in Hong Kong and did not raise national security matters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan made a visit to San Francisco, together with delegations from Guangdong Province and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong and partners in San Francisco signed three memorandums of understanding on developing carbon markets, sustainable finance, investment promotion and the nurturing of talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief said businesses in the United States were "curious" and "interested" in the opportunities available in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The business proposition we put to the business sector here is that the Greater Bay Area as a market is of huge size: 87 million people. This is one of the most affluent, most dynamic, economically very high vitality areas," he told reporters in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Presenting tremendous opportunities for the business sector here, no matter if it is for consumer market or for extending the service or solutions onto the mainland, the exchanges that we have with them proved this proposition to be quite attractive."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Regarding national security, Chan said businesses in the United States had other concerns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "No question has ever been raised in this respect... In fact, the concern and the interest of the business sector here is the stability of Hong Kong, the overall business environment, the impact of high interest rates on Hong Kong, and also the performance of stock market, the property market, as well as foreign business interest and investment in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan was due to arrive back in the SAR on Saturday morning.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong says the innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong has made a lot of progress in the past few years with the I&T ecosystem becoming more vibrant than before, adding that the SAR serves as a super value adder to foster global collaboration.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has the advantages to becoming an international I&T centre with its top institutions, experts and scholars, a mature intellectual property rights protection system, a robust rule of law and a good business environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past few years, the Hong Kong government has invested more than HK$210 billion to enhance technological research infrastructure, subsidise R&D activities, support collaboration among industry, academic and research sectors, as well as put together nurtured technology talents," he told RTHK's Your Home Address programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that the SAR has rolled out a number of policies to attract, retain and nurture talents, including the Technology Talent Admission Scheme, meant for admitting technology talents to conduct R&D work in Hong Kong, the STEM Internship Scheme for university students to gain experience in the field and the New Industrialisation and Technology Training Programme to subsidise training for staff in local companies on advanced technologies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I put together local and non-local researchers to conduct world-class and impactful scientific research. For this InnoHK research clusters, this is a very successful programme aiming to promote the global research collaboration. So far, we have established 29 InnoHK research centres in Hong Kong Science Park in collaboration with more than 30 top-notch universities and research institutions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the two clusters, one is life and health technology and the other one is robotics and AI. To further expand this successful programme, we are going to build a third cluster focused on advanced manufacturing, sustainable development, new energy and material as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the recently launched Research Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme (RAISe+) has been very successful in supporting hundreds of university research teams to transfer their research outcomes into real applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun also said that authorities would accelerate digital economy development to build Hong Kong into a smart city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The Digital Policy Office] will be responsible for formulating policies on digital government, data governance and information technology, promoting the opening up of data and offering more digital services. This office will be in charge of introducing more digital government initiative for convenience and benefit of the public and business sector," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we plan to launch over 100 digital government smart city initiatives including providing the digital payments for all government services."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the office would also work closely with the Guangdong province to promote cross-boundary public services initiative in both areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun believes that Hong Kong can put together the innovation resources from the GBA and the world to promote development and investment, making the territory the best springboard for overseas markets to venture into the GBA, the mainland and the Asian market.

 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the Amber Rainstorm Warning Signal at 5:40 am.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It had been issued at 3:25 am, and heavy rain was expected to fall generally over Hong Kong, exceeding 30 millimetres in an hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory had warned that there might be flooding in some low-lying and poorly drained areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People who were likely to be affected were advised to take all necessary precautions to reduce their exposure to risk posed by the heavy rain and flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  People should stay alert to the danger that may be brought about by river flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said people should stay away from watercourses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory said on Saturday morning that the Strong Wind Signal No 3 would remain in force until at least 3pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said at noon that Tropical Cyclone Maliksi had weakened into a tropical depression as it passed over Guangdong province.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory says it will consider issuing either the Standby Signal No 1 or the Strong Monsoon Signal, depending on how Maliksi weakens over inland areas and changes in the local wind conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that seas will be rough with swells and members of the public are advised to stay away from the shoreline and not to engage in water sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As the Strong Wind Signal No 3 is still in force, classes of kindergartens, schools for children with physical disability and schools for children with intellectual disability are suspended today.

 Police said a woman arrested on Wednesday is suspected of committing the offence of “providing pecuniary or other financial assistance or property for the commission of secession by other persons” under the National Security Law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said their investigation revealed the woman had provided HK$140,000 to fugitive Nathan Law and other individuals through an online subscription platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The woman was one of seven people arrested this week on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, which include former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were linked to suspected seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory issued the Strong Wind Signal No 3 at 4.40pm, and added it would remain in force until at least 6am on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Senior Scientific Officer Lee Shuk-ming said the chance of issuing a higher signal is rather low, unless Tropical Storm Maliksi rapidly intensifies or tracks closer to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said Maliksi would make landfall in the western part of Guangdong around midnight tonight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of 5pm, Maliksi was estimated to be about 290 kilometres southwest of Hong Kong. It is forecast to be slow-moving at first, and then move northwards later at about 15 kilometres per hour, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If we look at the radar imageries, we can see that the squally showers and strong winds associated with Maliksi are gradually affecting the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary. Local winds will strengthen progressively."

    Hong Kong retail sales fall in April

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The value of total retail sales for April dropped nearly 15 percent compared with the same month in 2023. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755577_1_20240531170816.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Provisional data from the Census and Statistics Department on Friday showed the city's retail sales for April fell 14.7 percent from a year earlier, partly due to a drop in visitor spending and a large number of outbound trips during the Easter holidays.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sales decreased to HK$29.6 billion in the second consecutive month of decline after a seven percent drop in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first four months of 2024 taken together, it was provisionally estimated the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.7 percent compared with the same period in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2024 saw it decrease by 16.5 percent compared with a year earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The value of total retail sales declined notably in April from a year earlier, partly because the Easter holidays rendered the effects of the changing consumption pattern of residents more visible," a government spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A large number of residents made outbound trips during the Easter holidays. This not only affected their local consumption during their time away but also could have reduced consumption in the days before and after the trips."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that unstable weather in April also had an impact on spending. Looking ahead, he said the changing consumption patterns of visitors and residents would continue to pose a challenge to the local retail sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the government hoped the revival of inbound tourism and rising earnings, as well as the new round of mega events plus the recent stabilisation of asset markets such as property would provide support to the market and boost the economy.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday condemned criticisms made by the United States, Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, as well as foreign media over the recent subversion trial involving 47 defendants, calling them groundless.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned "primary election" organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the court had carefully considered the law, evidence and arguments presented by the prosecution and defence during the 118-day trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said the verdict clearly stated the conspiracy in this case was aimed at undermining or overthrowing the political system and structure of the Hong Kong SAR, which is established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Such illegal acts, which endanger national security, have nothing to do with the so-called fight for democracy and human rights," the spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A total of 47 people were charged in the case. With the exception of two individuals, for whom there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the court that they were involved in the conspiracy, all 45 others were convicted, demonstrating the scale and seriousness of the conspiracy. The Department of Justice has informed the court of its intention to appeal against the acquittal of the two defendants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government demanded that the US and other Western countries, anti-China organisations and politicians, and foreign media stop spreading false reports and malicious attacks on the court's ruling in this case.

 The Department of Health warned people on Friday not to fall for fraudulent advertisements circulating online about free medical insurance by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health authorities said in a statement that false advertisements carrying the department's logo claimed the government would provide medical insurance for people aged 55 or above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said they have reported the case to police, adding that all remarks in those advertisements are false.

 The Observatory said the strong wind signal No. 3 will be issued at 4.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A tropical depression over the northern part of the South China Sea is forecast to move north, edging closer to the western coast of Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said according to the present forecast track, it will make landfall in western Guangdong from Friday evening to early Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials also said while the tropical depression is expected to move across inland of western Guangdong, the associated rainbands will still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 3.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The standby signal No 1 has been in force since 5.40pm on Thursday.

    Licensed taxi fleet investment 'could top HK$100mn'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Licence applications for taxi fleets ended on Friday, with an industry representative saying his group would invest more than HK$100 million in a squad of cabs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The licensed taxi fleet system is part of wider efforts to improve the service quality of point-to-point transport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the government, fleets operating in urban areas should have 300 to 1,000 taxis each, whereas those in the New Territories should have 100 to 350 cabs each.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And participating taxis must not be in use for more than three years when a licence is offered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport authorities are expected to issue a maximum of five licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Yue-ting, from the Hong Kong Tele-call Taxi Association, said he believes around eight applications were submitted before the noon deadline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On an RTHK programme, Wong said he and 12 other operators have joined hands in applying for a licence in the New Territories, in hopes of improving cab services there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the group would have to invest at least HK$100 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I estimate that, for the first six months, we would invest HK$3 million to HK$5 million in a taxi-hailing service, plus dash cameras and other systems in the vehicles," Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the vehicles, we'll mostly have to replace the existing ones because many of them would have been in use for more than three years when they are licensed. I think more than 80 percent of the taxis no longer fit the requirement. Each taxi will cost about HK$400,000, which means an expenditure of HK$100 million to replace some 300 vehicles."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow Kwok-keung, who chairs the Hong Kong Taxi and Public Light Bus Association, said he submitted an application for a fleet of about 400 taxis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said mainland ride-hailing giants Didi Chuxing and Gaode had contacted him on proposing to work together.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The court ruling on a subversion trial showed that national security risks exist in Hong Kong, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, three national security judges convicted 14 people of conspiring to commit subversion, relating to an opposition plot to take control of the Legislative Council to disrupt government operations. Prosecutors also announced their intention to appeal against the acquittal of two others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said people have to read the court verdict carefully and safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the government will take action against anti-China behaviour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The court ruling reflects that national security risks in Hong Kong truly exist. It's not like what some people said that they were just chanting some slogans and advocating for freedom. Their goal was to destroy Hong Kong, disrupt Hong Kong's constitutional order, paralyse the Hong Kong government, and on a deeper level, use Hong Kong as a base to inhibit the country's development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No one fighting for democracy and freedom would hope to paralyse the government or have the streets filled with petrol bombs, Chan said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755439_1_20240530222134.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government on Thursday said it strongly disapproves of, and condemns all baseless allegations by the United States Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) and the European Union (EU) against the city’s homegrown national security law as well as law enforcement action taken by the police’s National Security Department.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The police made seven arrests on Tuesday and Wednesday on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of the arrestees was former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The seven were accused of being responsible for seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CECC and EU had described the arrests as a violation of human rights and an attempt to stifle freedom of expression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a statement published on Thursday, authorities said their claims simply do not stand up to the facts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation,” the statement wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Offences in connection with seditious intention are very serious crimes, and no jurisdictions, including the US and those from the EU, will watch with folded arms acts and activities that endanger national security.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government stressed Hong Kong’s homegrown national security ordinance only targets an extremely small minority of people who endanger national security, adding that it will not hinder legitimate expression of opinions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Ordinance is a piece of legislation to defend against acts and activities endangering national security. Only invaders who want to intrude into our home to plunder and loot should be worried by the Ordinance,” the statement added.

 Police said five people were arrested near West Kowloon Court on Thursday for alleged disorderly conduct in public places
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said four people, aged between 32 and 68, failed to follow instructions when they entered the court building. They also ignored officers' verbal warnings and chanted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force added that they arrested another 32-year-old man after he chanted inside the court area and refused to cooperate with officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All five suspects are detained on suspicion of engaging in disorderly conduct in a public place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police reminded members of the public to abide by the law and express their views in a peaceful and orderly manner, without undermining national and public security.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday said the court ruling on a national security trial confirmed there was a conspiracy to commit subversion, which also showed the seriousness of the case.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Lee said the judgement handed down by a three-judge panel showed there was a conspiracy to subvert state power and to destroy and overthrow the existing political system and structure established under the Basic Law and the principle of One Country, Two Systems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the convictions of 45 of the 47 defendants showed the scale and severity of the plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Of the 16 who pleaded not guilty, 14 were convicted of conspiring to commit subversion and two were acquitted. Thirty-one others pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted that the Department of Justice had indicated its intention to appeal against the acquittals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the SAR is duty-bound to safeguard national security, and is determined to fight any acts that compromise this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the subversion saga had harmed Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is no winner out of this case. This is a very sad story that some Hong Kong people tried to conduct subversion of Hong Kong. I think it is good that we were able to interdict the plot so that the Hong Kong citizens will not suffer and Hong Kong will now resume to a normal state," he told reporters.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday issued the Standby Signal Number 1 and said it would remain in effect until at least 6am on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a tropical cyclone located about 800 kilometres from Hong Kong could affect the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The broad area of low pressure in the South China Sea has become a tropical depression, it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said strong winds were not expected to have a significant impact on the region yet, but the tropical depression could move closer to the coast and strengthen slightly during Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would assess the need to issue the Strong Wind Signal No 3 based on the storm's intensity, as well as local wind conditions.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice on Thursday announced its intention to appeal against the acquittal of two of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were among 16 defendants who pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a verdict delivered on Thursday morning, the judges said they were not sure if Lau and Lee had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After the lunch break, Director of Public Prosecutions Maggie Yang told the court that the Department of Justice intends to appeal using the amended Criminal Procedure Ordinance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She requested that the pair be kept on bail, pending a decision on the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee's defence counsel argued against that, saying his client should be a "free man" unless the court grants the appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three-judge panel decided to extend the bail of Lau and Lee. They are now required to report to police on a monthly basis, instead of twice every week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also said mitigation hearings for those convicted are scheduled for June 25.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to the media, chief superintendent Steve Li from the police's National Security Department welcomed the conviction of 14 defendants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the judgement, you can see that the court regarded this as a very serious case. This is a very illicit plot... The ultimate goal is to paralyse the government," he said.

 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 at 5.40pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea will soon develop into a tropical depression. It is expected to gradually move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory added that there will be squally showers and thunderstorms in the coming days, while winds offshore and on high ground will strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Electronic queuing systems for taxis have been brought in at the arrival hall to reduce queues during extreme weather, the Airport Authority said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Steven Yiu, the executive director of airport operations, said the system was introduced in March this year after people had to queue for hours last year during a typhoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said a mobile phone notification or the airport's information board would now tell passengers when their taxi was ready.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We tried to avoid a long queuing for prolonged-waiting passengers. For example, if the typhoon lasts three to four hours, we don't let the passengers keep queuing for long periods of time, so we give them some sort of queuing number so they can stay in the restaurant and also rest until being called forward to the taxi station," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We created a resting area, actually it is a large area with over 500 chairs, with Wifi [and a] charging facility. We will also distribute water, biscuits to them, and also some blankets as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority hopes to make passengers feel comfortable, especially when taxis and Airport Express trains can't operate under Typhoon Signal No 9.

    Judges cite intention in acquitting two defendants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Three judges presiding over a subversion trial centred on an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations said in their ruling on Thursday that two of the defendants were acquitted because they were not sure if the pair had the intention to subvert state power.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the judgement, former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun never advocated vetoing government budgets in the election forum they had attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution argued during the trial that the suspects planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure to be introduced by the government, had they become Legco members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Handing down the verdict, the judges said although Lau's name appeared on a declaration of poll candidates, they were not sure if he had signed it himself or authorised someone to sign it on his behalf.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Signatories to the "Inked without Regret" declaration agreed to use the vetoing power of lawmakers to force the chief executive to respond to the five demands of protesters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a fact that [Lau] did not post the [declaration] on his Facebook page and he did not make use of the [declaration] in his electioneering work," the judgement read.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also said although the now-disbanded Civic Party, which Lee belonged to, endorsed the declaration, he was not yet a candidate at the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also noted that Lee had asked his election team to come up with a new pamphlet that did not mention the five demands after looking at the national security law, which took effect in June 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The pair were released after the verdict at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are still other defendants in this case, warranting our concern and even love," Lau told reporters outside the courtroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there's any star in this case, this judgement should be the star. It sets the jurisprudence, reasoning, logic, perspectives of our judges. Please study it. This is more important than any single individual of this case. This is part of our rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the first thing he'd like to do was to have a meal with his family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel calm, as I have always been... Thank you to everyone who have been concerned about us and expressing your care. We all can feel that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because there is a tendency for the prosecution to apply for an appeal, so I cannot make any comment on this case at this moment."

    Use of force not necessary for subversion, court finds

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The court ruled that those who intentionally commit an act that contravenes the national security law with the intent to subvert state power don't have to use force or know they're breaching the law to be found guilty." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755349_1_20240530121750.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A landmark ruling on Hong Kong’s largest national security trial to date has set out that those who plot to subvert state power need not use force or employ criminal means to be found guilty of breaching the national security law (NSL), nor do they need to know that their tactics were unlawful.
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan laid out their reasoning in a 319-page judgement, which found 14 defendants guilty of conspiring to commit subversion while acquitting two. Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to the same charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges concluded that those convicted had taken part in a plot to seriously obstruct, disrupt or undermine the duties and functions of the Hong Kong government by unlawful means with a view to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court found that they had planned to indiscriminately veto any budget or public expenditure request by the government if they win a majority in the Legislative Council election in 2020, to compel the chief executive to accede to demands made by anti-government protesters or be forced to dissolve the legislature and resign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges rejected arguments by defence lawyers that "unlawful means" necessitates the use or threat of force; that guilty parties must know that what they were doing was illegal; and that Legco members who veto government budgets are merely exercising their constitutional duty instead of breaking the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the ruling, the judges noted that the NSL was drafted with the understanding that national security in the city could be undermined not only by force, but also by non-violent actions such as advocating Hong Kong's independence, inciting public hatred, and paralysing the work of the government and legislature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said limiting "unlawful means" to acts of force would be such a narrow interpretation that "would be absurd and illogical and defeat the purpose of the NSL".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges also swept aside defence arguments that "other unlawful means" should only include criminal acts, saying it’s “inconceivable that acts or activities by whatever forms and methods with a view to subverting the state power could be considered to be acceptable or tolerable.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moreover, they ruled that the defendants did not have to be aware that they were breaching the law at the time of the offence, so long as the accused had intentionally committed an unlawful act with a view to subverting state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Therefore, it was irrelevant to the issue of guilt that the accused acted with a mistaken belief that his or her means was lawful; to hold otherwise would go against the purpose of the NSL,” the judges wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While the judges agreed that legislators should not automatically approve government budgets, any plan to indiscriminately veto such budgets in an attempt to force the government to accept political demands would, they concluded, constitute an abuse of power that contravenes both the Basic Law and the NSL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court also dismissed defence claims that the offence wasn’t clearly defined because the law doesn’t provide specific definitions for "subversion" or "state power".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judges said it was obvious that all the powers of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ultimately came from the Constitution and the Central People's Government, and concluded that "state power" refers to those wielded by the SAR government, including the various duties and functions it performs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a dictionary definition of "subversion", the judges ruled that “a serious interference in, disruption or undermining of the performance of duties and functions in accordance with the law by the body of power of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region… could amount to an act ‘subverting the State power’.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As such, they found that 14 defendants had knowingly participated in the plot, with the intention of subverting state power, and therefore found them guilty.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan has told the business community in Berkeley, California that he hopes there will be further financial and technological exchanges between the state's bay area and the Greater Bay Area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His remark came after the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau and the University of Hong Kong both signed a memorandum of understanding with a California-based climate institute to cooperate in areas such as talent exchanges, green fintech and carbon market development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope, too, that we can encourage financial and technological exchanges. The global gap for green funding and technology is enormous, measured in trillions of US dollars. Let's turn this need into opportunities,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to say that Hong Kong is a great place to do business in Asia, being the "super connector" between China and the rest of the world, and invited US businesses to pay a visit to the SAR to see what is on offer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also told attendees at a climate event that Hong Kong is committed to a greener future and that the SAR plans to reach carbon neutrality in the coming decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong is committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We are adopting a four-pronged strategy to reach neutrality: net-zero electricity generation, green buildings, green transport and waste reduction,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Indeed, we were among the first cities in Asia to take action against climate change… Our carbon emissions peaked in 2014 and have shown a general downward trend since.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 The observatory on Thursday said it will issue the Standby Signal Number 1 if a low-pressure area in the central to northern part of the South China Sea develops into a tropical depression.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The forecaster said the low-pressure area is still loosely organised but may intensify. It is expected to move towards the coast of western Guangdong, near the Pearl River Estuary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that there will be showers, thunderstorms and strong winds in the coming days, while offshore winds will also strengthen.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The group in charge of promoting patriotic education under the Constitution and Basic Law Promotion Steering Committee on Thursday said it is going to hold design contests in which participants create mascots and logos that reflect the theme of "love our country, love Hong Kong, and love our community."
 <br>
  <br/>
  The competitions would be held in separate primary, secondary, and tertiary divisions. The winning design could be used in events celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The winners and the first and second runner-ups would also receive annual passes to the Hong Kong Palace Museum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registration for the competition starts today and will close on July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group's convenor, Starry Lee, said all schools in the SAR would be invited to join the competitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have designed a theme that is ‘to love our motherland, to love Hong Kong and to love the community’. We need a logo or symbol to represent this main theme. We will issue a letter to all schools in the community, including universities, secondary and primary schools, to invite all schools to join and participate in this competition," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hopefully, we can find some very symbolic design so that we can use in other part of our activities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while participation is voluntary, she expects a lot of students would join the contests.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Fourteen people were on Thursday found guilty of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law after a court ruled that they had sought to subvert state power by participating in an unsanctioned 'primary election' organised by the opposition camp in July 2020.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two others – former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun – were acquitted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those convicted in the subversion case were Gordon Ng, Tat Cheng, Clarisse Yeung, Michael Pang, Kalvin Ho, Helena Wong, Sze Tak-loy, Gwyneth Ho, Raymond Chan, Owen Chow, Lam Cheuk-ting, Leung Kwok-hung, Ricky Or and Winnie Yu.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were remanded in custody, pending sentencing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict was handed down by three national security judges in a hearing at the West Kowloon Court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others earlier pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit subversion.

    Robots help with spine surgery at Queen Mary Hospital

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Over the past eight months, robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at the hospital. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755312_1_20240530094044.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Robot-assisted spine surgery has been carried out successfully on 20 patients at Queen Mary Hospital since October. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong say the robot can help surgeons be more precise and accurate when placing screws, and thus reduce the risk of complications and the need for more surgery.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Jason Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong's medical school, led the research team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would say there are a couple of aspects that it improves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First it of course increases patient safety. So in the past when we are doing the surgeries, where we insert the screws, they are all done by free hand, meaning that it is up to the surgeons' experience to identify where the correct position is for the screws...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Secondly, it helps the surgeon with the overall process of the surgery. Surgeons no longer need to be completely concentrated to put screws in accurately. They can actually put their major part of the concentration into more risky procedures, such as decompression of the nerves."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Professor Cheung said surgeons would still remain in overall control.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So even to this day when I am using the robot, despite it guiding me, I will still always check whether the track of the screws are correct or not. So I will always double-check myself by feel, perhaps an X-ray just to confirm whether everything is accurate," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Cheung said the robot didn't just help with inserting the screws. He said, prior to surgery, surgeons would take a CT scan from the patient and plan where to put the screws. The system would then match this with the plan and guide the surgeon.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The High Court is set to begin delivering a verdict on whether 16 opposition figures breached the national security law by participating in an unofficial legislative primary election four years ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Queues formed outside the West Kowloon Court where the hearing is held amid tightened security and a heavy police presence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sixteen defendants who have pleaded not guilty are expecting to hear their fate after a subversion trial lasting 118 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If convicted, they could face up to life in prison although sentencing is expected later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among the 47 politicians and activists charged with conspiracy to commit subversion under the national security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities alleged that an unofficial Legco primary election in July 2020 was a subversive attempt by the opposition camp to win a majority in Legco and paralyse the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The 16 who stood trial include former lawmakers Lam Cheuk-ting and Leung Kwok-hung, and journalist-turned-activist Gwyneth Ho.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case was centred on whether they conspired to subvert state power by planning to indiscriminately vote down the budget and force the then-Chief Executive to resign through their participation in the polls.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty-one others, including former legal scholar Benny Tai and ex-student activist Joshua Wong, pleaded guilty to their charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judiciary has set aside more than 400 seats for the public to hear the verdict on Thursday - the largest national security case to date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three national security judges - Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan - presided over the jury-free trial.

<div class="itemFullText">
 National security police on Wednesday said they arrested one more person on suspicion of "offences in connection with seditious intention" under the Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Six people, including the former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, were arrested on Tuesday and linked to seditious posts published on social media ahead of what authorities described as a "sensitive date".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is understood that a 53-year-old woman arrested on Wednesday is the wife of one of those taken into custody the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers are not ruling out further arrests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Wednesday said it arrested 12 people, including footballers and coaches, for alleged match-fixing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body said the head coach, a midfielder and a goalkeeper of a football team in the Hong Kong Premier League were arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also taken into custody were a coach and five players from two teams in the third-tier Second Division. Three betting agents were arrested as well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC did not name the suspects or their clubs, citing an ongoing investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The alleged offences took place over three seasons, beginning with the 2021 campaign, authorities said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Matthew Chang, a principal investigator with the ICAC, said the coaches allegedly communicated with players with signals during the matches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They would give some secret signals during the match if they can recruit some players in the same team, like moving their head or using their body language, gestures, to show that at which specific times the involved players have to do something, like to keep going to score or just stop to defend,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said each player could get up to tens of thousands of dollars for each match fixed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is also believed that some of those arrested placed bets in illegal gambling for gains, with the amount of bets topping HK$1 million in one season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said the suspects have been released on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Football Association of Hong Kong, China said it will fully assist the ICAC in the investigation, stressing that it has "zero tolerance" towards football corruption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the association said if the allegations are proven true, it will severely punish the clubs, players and coaches involved by revoking their memberships and imposing lifetime suspensions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Premier League expressed regret over the incident, adding that it will work with the football association to create a fair and clean football industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau said it will not tolerate illegal acts. The bureau said it will urge the local football association to work with ICAC and improve the anti-corruption awareness of football clubs.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Wednesday said efforts are underway to respond to a court order on formulating an official framework to recognise same-sex partnerships following a landmark ruling last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Court of Final Appeal ruled last September that the government has a constitutional duty to allow gay couples to register their partnerships, in a case brought by former activist Jimmy Sham who married his male partner in New York in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The top court said the government would be given two years to come up with an alternative framework so that same-sex relationships could be provided legal recognition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to a request by lawmaker Regina Ip for an update on the situation, constitutional and mainland affairs chief Erick Tsang said officials are "actively taking forward the relevant work" and will seek the views of the Legislative Council in due course, once there are concrete suggestions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsang also said the matter is complex and involves a wide range of issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are now following the court's relevant judgment and timetable, conducting detailed study with the [Department of Justice] and relevant bureaux on the mechanism relating to the legal recognition of same-sex relationship, thresholds of recognition, eligibilities, conditions, how to effectively avoid abuses of the alternative framework, etc, as well as the rights and obligations arisen, including 'core rights' and 'supplementary rights', and formulating implementation," he said.

 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Tuesday told business leaders in San Francisco that the SAR is a “natural launching pad” for them to enter the Asian and China markets, as he promoted collaboration between the China-US bay areas on a five-day trip.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a business luncheon, Chan said there were many commonalities between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area, with the two places the global engines of technological innovation and also the birthplaces of tech firm giants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Bay Area are a magnet, attracting a lot of talent, that is our competitive advantage, and also this will give us continuous impetus in terms of innovation and technological development,” Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He went on to point out there’s also a difference between the two places in terms of population and market sizes, as the Californian bay area has a population of about seven million, while the Guangdong bay area population stands at some 87 million, with huge market potential contributing to some 12 percent of the Chinese economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So if you want to launch your products or services in Asia, in China, Hong Kong is naturally your launching pad, because from here you can springboard to other parts of the mainland and Asia,” he told delegates, noting the SAR’s financial markets are much bigger in breadth and depth compared with Singapore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between InvestHK and San Francisco’s Bay Area Council to promote cooperation especially in the green economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the finance minister also met with representatives of five Hong Kong startups currently exploring expansion in San Francisco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five SAR startups specialise in areas including biodegradable materials, new construction materials, online marketing, artificial intelligence, and robotics, and the entrepreneurs are exploring the market there whilst undertaking training programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also welcomed a plan by a Silicon Valley startup accelerator company to set up a technological innovation centre in the SAR.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s lived-in home prices rose for the second straight month in April, increasing by 0.3 percent from March, with all home sizes seeing gains.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Data released by the Rating and Valuation Department on Wednesday showed that the latest official price index of second-hand units stood at 308.7 last month, compared with 305.7 in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The increase was broad-based, as all small, medium, and large sized units saw gains of about 0.3 percent on a monthly basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also came after the index logged its first increase in 11 months in March, as buyers returned to the market after Financial Secretary Paul Chan scrapped all property cooling measures in his Budget on February 28.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, taking the first four months in total, home prices still fell 0.84 percent, and the latest index level was still about 13 percent lower compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Rental prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent on a monthly basis, also a second straight increase, but still 4.6 percent lower from the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city’s rents rose 0.5 percent in the first four months of the year.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Baptist University is hosting a conference called FoodMed, which will look at ways of better utilising the heritage of Chinese medicine.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Baptist University academic says he hopes a framework can be established on promoting "food as medicine" in the primary healthcare system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The university is hosting a two-day conference called FoodMed. Terence Lau, the university's Interim Chief Innovation Officer and chair of the conference, said Chinese medicine used many herbal components that people also consumed as food, such as ginseng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, he was asked about the relationship to medicine, especially as there had previously been controversies in Hong Kong over naturopathic - or so-called holistic - treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can enhance primary health by alleviating a lot of unhealthy conditions and food can also provide a lot of benefits for chronic diseases," he said. "We are not trying to replace the traditional, or western, medicine doctors. But I think it's another approach to enhance people's health."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Lau also called for the greater use of technology in the field, especially when it came to data collection. He said Chinese medicine had a lot of heritage and the conference would be looking at better ways to utilise this.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Tuesday said a four-year-old girl suffered a cardiac arrest after receiving stitches in Yan Chai Hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said the medical staff resuscitated her and that she regained a heartbeat 18 minutes later, but remains in a coma and in critical condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She was sent to Yan Chai Hospital’s accident and emergency department after sustaining a head injury in a fall on Saturday night. The child had a slight fever and medical staff put stitches into a two-centimetre gash in her head.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital's chief executive, Ian Cheung, said this incident was "very rare", adding the staff had followed procedures when giving her three stitches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was a very short process... She cried during the first stitch, but she quieted down during the second and the third stitches," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We checked her after completing the process because it's over so quickly, and we found out she didn't have a pulse. So we must find experts to give us advice on why this happened."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The girl was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong Nai-chung, chief of service for paediatrics in both Princess Margaret and Yan Chai hospitals, said she suffered from ischemic encephalopathy, which meant her brain was injured because blood supply decreased when her heart stopped.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently, she is on a ventilator, given heart medication and drugs to control seizures and swelling in the brain. These are also coupled with antibiotics and nutrient injections. Our team will monitor her situation closely and provide the most appropriate treatment for her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority said it is upset by the incident, and is providing assistance to the girl's family.

    Six arrested over 'seditious posts'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police say the case relates to seditious posts published on social media. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1755055_1_20240528184935.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people were arrested on Tuesday under Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation, with police saying the group is suspected of "offences in connection with seditious intention".
 <br>
  <br/>
  National security police accused a woman who was on remand of taking advantage of "a forthcoming sensitive date" and publishing seditious posts on social media anonymously, with the help of five others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Security Chris Tang said former vice-chairwoman of the now-defunct Hong Kong Alliance, Chow Hang-tung, was one of those arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 37 and 65, were arrested by national security police at various locations in the city, including the Tai Lam Centre for Women.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social media posts since April were allegedly aimed at inciting public hatred of the central government, the SAR administration and the judiciary, and were allegedly designed to encourage people to organise or take part in illegal activities, police said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Electronic devices suspected of having been used to publish posts with seditious intention were among items seized during the operation, the force added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These are the first arrests made under Hong Kong's homegrown national security legislation that came into effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A police spokesperson noted that people found guilty of committing offences in connection with seditious intention face a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also warned that people who try to endanger national security should not think they can avoid police investigation by making anonymous comments online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The allegations (against) this group of people are using a Facebook page on social media to advocate hatred against our central government, the Hong Kong government and also our judiciary,” Tang told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They're relating to a forthcoming sensitive date. But I would like to reiterate that... the main crime is not about the subject. It's about their utilising the subject during which they incited hatred against the central government and our Hong Kong government and the judiciary. This incitement of hatred is the cause of the crime.”

    Fencing four hope to bring HK good results

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The four fencers representing the SAR in the Olympics on Tuesday said they hope to use the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait next month as final preparation for Paris in July.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Star fencer Vivian Kong has won several large events, including the Fujairah Women's Epee World Cup 2024 and the Barcelona Women's Epee World Cup 2024, but has yet to win an Olympic medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said she still has to give it her all, even though this will be her third Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's like psychologically and mentally [where] I need to be calm and that's like usually the hardest part when we compete especially in foreign competitions. Technically, it's all my coach [Octavian Zidaru]. He knows every action we work on," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He's always like this one higher, this one lower, this one point more accurately, so there's always something wrong with my actions, so I have to work hard to make him happy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Olympic gold-medallist Edgar Cheung said he doesn't want to let the pressure to win another medal affect his performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the competition in Kuwait will give him another practice opportunity before the Games, adding that it's vital to perform to the best of his ability and enjoy the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course, there are challenges but for me, it is like preparing well for myself, and give all my best, and afterwards, we will see what happens. I think me and Vivian had quite a good experience about the Olympics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the two of the rest, one is my ex-roommate so we are friends. We have been talking about the Olympics, how it is and I just told them to enjoy and to have fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Epee fencer Cedric Ho said he is excited to have booked his place in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Though I'm really excited, I do want to bring that energy down a little and enter the Olympics with a calm mindset," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will be going to the Asian Fencing Championship in Kuwait at the end of June, and those results will determine our rankings in the Olympics. I will use that competition as a prep for the Games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for Daphne Chan, she said she doesn't have specific expectations from the Games, and is just looking forward to learning from her teammates and staying focused for Paris.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers will soon be able to watch a series of special RTHK Olympics-related programmes in Putonghua, Cantonese and English, including some produced on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sign language and audio description services will also be available.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This comes after RTHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangdong Radio and Television on Monday, and another with Beijing Radio and Television Station (BRTV) on Tuesday, to jointly deliver news related to the Paris Olympics and Paralympics 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Media Group is also a cooperation partner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of the special shows will be produced locally, featuring issues related to Environmental, social, and governance, to echo the Paris Games’ goal of being the greenest Games ever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There will also be a raft of programmes produced by the Guangdong and Beijing TV stations, with content ranging from local culture, behind-the-scenes stories of the Winter Olympics 2022, as well as individual athletes’ preparations for this summer's Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a signing ceremony, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the programmes will promote a sports culture in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This allows all Hongkongers to cheer for athletes from the national team and Team Hong Kong, while uniting all sectors of the society and encouraging residents to do more exercise,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Meanwhile, we hope that the broadcast of the Paris Olympics and the Paralympics Games 2024 will further spur local catering and retail activities, boosting the local economy by creating a ‘multiplier effect’,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li Xiulei, deputy chief editor of BRTV, said the cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing marks the beginning of a deepening of cultural exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I hope Hong Kong viewers and listeners could learn about Beijing’s profound culture via the programmes by BRTV,” she said, adding that she hopes the two cities will further strengthen collaboration to provide more diversified programmes for residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong government has purchased broadcasting rights for this year's Olympics, allowing RTHK, TVB, Hoy TV and ViuTV to show the Games on their free-to-air channels.

    Increase penalties over illicit cigarettes: customs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Customs has recorded over 7,000 cases related to illicit cigarette activities in the first five months.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officials on Tuesday proposed increasing the penalties for crimes involving illicit cigarettes, after they detected a 50 percent rise in cases this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Customs recorded over 7,000 cases in the first five months, which was a 54 percent increase when compared with the same period last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An assistant customs commissioner, Lai Chi-wing, said most illicit cigarettes were shipped into Hong Kong before the pandemic, but more travellers had been bringing in illicit cigarettes into the city after the border reopened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total number of incoming passengers bringing in dutiable cigarettes was over 5,000 [from February to May], so this is not a small figure. So we try to target these incoming passengers bringing in small amount of cigarettes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials recommended increasing the maximum imprisonment term from two to seven years, and to double the maximum fine to HK$2 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also proposed including the offence of illicit cigarettes under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance, as cases may involve syndicates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs proposed that cigarettes being sold lower than the tax amount should be presumed as duty-not-paid goods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It pointed out there were packs of cheap white cigarettes being sold at HK$40 in the market, which was even lower than the required tax of HK$66 for a packet of 20 cigarettes.

 Lawmakers on Tuesday called on authorities to speed up its long-standing plan to turn south Lantau into a tourist spot, with some urging the government to make it a high-end vacation resort.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials told a Legco meeting they were collecting the public's views over the next two months on building a pier and accommodation facilities in Cheung Sha, as well as setting up a water sports centre at Hong Kong’s longest beach there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the proposed South Lantau Eco-Recreation Corridor plan, an uphill chairlift would also be built in Cheung Sha, and the neighbouring areas of Shek Pik, Shui Hau and Pui O would get walkways around a reservoir, along the shore of a sand flat, or on treetops.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But legislators like Andrew Lam said the government had earlier made such plans in its blueprint to develop Lantau back in 2017, and had asked authorities to act on them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Undersecretary for Development David Lam said the government would try to build more parking spaces, family playgrounds and a visitor’s centre in the area in a year or two.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The undersecretary said preliminary assessments on the environment and infrastructure had shown the proposals would not have any adverse impact on south Lantau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said it is estimated the corridor would attract 4,000 to 6,000 more visitors a day during holidays.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have to access the reception capacity of Lantau as a whole because it wouldn't be ideal if too many visitors are going to the area and destroy the local characteristics. So maybe we'll implement an online booking system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said authorities could transform south Lantau into an upscale vacation destination featuring high-end resort hotels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said authorities were liaising with developers and had received some positive response.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong triathlete Jason Ng has beaten Ayan Beisenbayev from Kazakhstan for the remaining spot in Paris Olympic qualification reserved for the highest-ranked Asian nation or region that hadn't already made it through to the Games.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Ng had been going neck to neck against Beisenbayev for the remaining place, after Japan's top three athletes secured spots based on individual Olympic rankings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During the weekend's Asia Triathlon Cup, Ng was disqualified for wearing a helmet during the running portion of the competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, given that Beisenbayev failed to finish on the podium to accumulate the points he needed, Hong Kong were able to win a spot in Paris.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng secured the 33rd ticket for the SAR delegation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he expects half of Hong Kong's companies would be using artificial intelligence by the end of this year, adding that technology and innovation is the government's priority.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the UBS Asian Investment Conference, Lee said the SAR understands the important role technology plays in the future of investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the unique 'One Country, Two Systems' principle, Hong Kong continues to evolve. As we embrace new technologies and sustainable practices, we strengthen our position as the foreign investment gateway to mainland China, and as the conduit for mainland enterprises to invest in the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology and innovation is a central priority of the Hong Kong SAR government. That includes applying AI technology to fast track our smart city and digital government ambitions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the government was launching more than 100 digital government and smart-city initiatives and expediting the establishment of an AI Supercomputing Centre in Cyberport.

    Govt not given up on waste charging: environment chief

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green groups disagreed with the government's decision to postpone waste charging indefinitely, but the environment minister stressed officials had not given up on the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The administration announced on Monday it would not implement the pay-as-you-throw scheme on August 1 as originally planned, citing concerns among residents and the limited coverage of recycling facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday, Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan said it was not suitable to set a date for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our society has to be mature enough to accept this approach. Also, when the policy is introduced, its design has to be easy and accepted by the public, and be straight forward for frontline workers," Tse told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the coming year, we will of course expand our efforts on waste reduction and recycling, as well as promotion. On the other hand, we will also look at how we can enhance the scheme, gauge public sentiment, and see whether we have the conditions to introduce waste charging. We are not giving up on this concept."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said the government might roll out waste charging in phases if officials decided to re-introduce the scheme in future, so that it's more easily accepted by the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Edwin Lau, the founder and executive director of The Green Earth, told the same programme that the decision in postponing the scheme reflected a lack of faith and determination in the administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the government's poll showed a majority of residents opposed waste charging, he understood the business sector was ready for the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many large companies and organisations said they had been prepared and had no issue [with the policy]. I have also asked some from the middle class, they said [paying] HK$50 a month was a very small amount," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government appeared to have amplified negative responses to the policy, but did not focus on positive feedbacks."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Backchat programme, Wendell Chan from Friends of the Earth called on the government to dig deeper to understand public opinion on the policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we need to know is why opinion shifted, what happened there, what caused people to not like this scheme," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I don't think we went in-depth enough, in terms of analysing these problems in order to tackle them. The problem is that the government, right now, is way too willing to back down instead of trying to resolve these issues."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, called for more recycling points.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 There has been a mixed reaction to the news that the government has indefinitely postponed the roll-out of its waste charging scheme. Some lawmakers say they back the decision, noting that a trial had found many concerns about the pay-as-you-throw initiative. Others insisted that Hong Kong still has to find ways to better manage its waste.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The founder of the Environmental Association, Yau Wing-kwong, says a delay is reasonable. But he says officials should now get back to the original point of the scheme and better promote recycling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Waste charging is only one of the many ways to reduce waste and waste treatment is a worldwide problem," he said. "One important thing is that we have to put more recycling facilities, more recycling points and shops so that we can push up recycling."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat said she supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”. But Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Monday were largely sympathetic towards the decision to suspend the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after a meeting at the Legislative Council, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said the ultimate goal of the scheme was to promote recycling and reduce waste, but he acknowledged the public had misconceptions about the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The public misunderstood that this whole thing is actually tantamount to a poll tax, which means that everyone has to start paying more taxes because everyone needs to generate garbage," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people are not aware of the fact that, no - that is not the end game. The end game is to reduce wastage generation. To do that, you need to do the wastage collection, the separation, so that some can be recycled. The whole world is doing that, and I cannot believe Hong Kong should just surrender and forget it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said authorities shouldn’t abandon the waste charging scheme altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We insist the policy should be carried out because it is environmental protection. We feel disappointed that [over] the last two years the government [had inadequate] preparation to implement the policy," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, DAB lawmaker Elizabeth Quat supported the government's move to postpone the scheme, which she called "impractical”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat urged the government to continue educating the public and to provide support for the city's recycling industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think now is a very good timing for the government to promote recycling and the reduction of waste. Because going through all this education process, a lot of citizens think that they support environmental protection and they want to participate in waste reduction," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Quat also suggested the government introduce additional incentives, such as a rewards scheme, to encourage people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle.

 Fans of the Japanese anime character Doraemon can now catch the time-travelling robot cat on some trains, as well as at the Siu Hong Light Rail stop.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Leading up to the Doraemon exhibition on July 13 at the Avenue of Stars, the MTR Corporation has put up posters and decorations from the series at the stop, and has transformed some Light Rail, East Rail Line and Airport Express trains with the Doraemon theme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trains are covered in Doraemon blue, while the doors are pink to depict the "Anywhere Door" portal to any destination.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  S K Lam, speaking for the organisers of the Doraemon event, said he hopes people can enjoy the iconic character during their journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think Doraemon is everyone's friend. We want to bring more joy and more creativity to people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "MTR is one of the important daily [modes of] transportation in Hong Kong, so when people can see it everyday, we are happy to share the joy with everybody. Of course, people can also catch the train to our exhibition."

  <br/>
  Among the suspects picked up on suspicion of conspiracy to launder money were 14 Indonesian migrant workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A helper is suspected of having acted as an intermediary for a syndicate to recruit others, with meetings arranged at locations such as parks, fast food restaurants and hotel rooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers on Monday said they believe the helpers were paid between HK$1,000 and HK$2,500 for opening accounts, which were then managed by the syndicate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For foreign domestic workers, the amount [allegedly] paid is relatively high compared to their salaries. That also was the main incentive for them to [allegedly] sell their bank accounts," said Chief Inspector So Chi-bing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bank accounts are suspected of being linked to 39 cases of fraud involving losses of HK$5.4 million, police added.

 RTHK announced on Monday that the broadcaster will join hands with Guangdong Radio and Television station (GRT) to produce various sports programmes including a documentary on legendary football players in both places.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The two stations also agreed to play each other's programmes about the upcoming Paris Olympics in order to broaden the audience's horizons and promote interactive exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy director for broadcasting, Christine Wai, signed a memorandum of understanding with the head of GRT's sports channel in Shenzhen on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "RTHK has been actively promoting cooperation and exchanges with various media organisations on the mainland. In addition to sports, we have also collaborated on television programmes that promote Chinese history and culture, and foster a sense of patriotism. These efforts aim to help Hong Kong people integrate into the overall development of the country and cultivate a sense of national identity," Wai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy director of GRT, Zhong Shixun, said the new agreement would bring high-quality development cooperation and initiate new collaborative projects that will bring mutual benefits and win-win outcomes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transport workers’ union on Monday called on the government to ban unlicensed ride-hailing services and address the plight of the taxi trade.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Motor Transport Workers General Union said cab drivers have suffered a more than 30 percent drop in business in recent years due to competition with illegal taxi services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Videos circulating online appear to show cabbies posing as Uber passengers before asking drivers to stop at locations the police have been called to.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee has urged people to leave such matters to law enforcement agencies, but the union’s principal vice-chairperson, Chong Wing-tak, said taxi drivers are not convinced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why do drivers perform sting operations? It's because of a lack of enforcement action by the government, transport authorities, and the police. We have endured this for more than ten years. We can't bear it anymore, so some drivers have organised these sting operations," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Harry Ho, the union's director of the taxi driver branch, described illegal cab drivers as "irresponsible", noting that any injuries that occur during unlicensed ride-hailing services are not covered by insurance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July, the Transport and Logistics Bureau is expected to report to lawmakers the results of a study on ride-hailing services.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced it would not implement the citywide waste charging scheme on August 1 as originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk told the Legislative Council that various surveys had revealed significant concerns among residents about the pay-as-you-throw scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also highlighted the limited coverage of recycling facilities, pointing out that the city's existing recycling infrastructure was inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also said the scheme had increased the workload and pressure on cleaners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that Hong Kong's economic recovery had not lived up to expectations and the implementation of the scheme could have a negative impact on businesses, particularly in the catering sector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also addressed the misconception that the government's aim with the waste charging scheme was to generate more revenue. He clarified that the primary objective of the scheme was to improve waste management practices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In light of these factors, the government had taken the decision to shelve the waste charging scheme, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he stressed the government remained committed to improving waste management and recycling practices in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government would step up publicity work to raise awareness of waste management and improve the city’s recycling network.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government plans to report back to Legco on its work by the middle of next year, he said.

    Minimum wage formula not lopsided: labour chief

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Labour and welfare chief Chris Sun says the administration has to help low-income workers who don't have a lot of bargaining power. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1754864_1_20240527142045.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Monday brushed aside concerns that a new mechanism for setting the statutory minimum wage was unfair to employers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Earlier this month, the Executive Council approved recommendations to review the minimum wage annually instead of every two years. There would also be a new formula for calculating the hourly pay rate, which bars any reduction.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legislative Council panel meeting, lawmakers representing the business sector said the new mechanism only focuses on employees and gives workers the false hope of an annual pay rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun, in response, said there is a need to help 17,000 low-income workers, who only account for 0.6 percent of the workforce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have very little bargaining power under the market mechanism. There are a lot of constraints on these workers, be it their abilities and other reasons, it is difficult for them to earn a decent pay," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to reassure them that their wages would only go up rather than down. If they have to worry about the prospects of a wage cut, then it would add to their plight."

    Divided views on future of waste charging scheme

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Opinion remained split on the best way forward for a citywide waste charging scheme, with some lawmakers urging authorities to shelve the plan and green groups calling for a timeline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sources said the government would shelve the pay-as-you-throw scheme scheduled to take effect from August 1, with lawmakers expected to discuss its fate during a Legco panel meeting on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Greenpeace campaigner Leanne Tam told an RTHK programme that it was "irresponsible" to put the plan on the back-burner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe this won't help solve the waste problem in Hong Kong. Government departments should take the lead in implementing the waste charging scheme," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Why not do it in phases first, instead of ignoring the issue and pretending that nothing's happened? This will waste a bill that's been on hold for 20 years, and Hong Kong will lose its chance to reduce waste."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But a legislator and industry representatives told an RTHK programme that they welcome the move because the city was simply not ready for the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's more appropriate to shelve [the scheme] indefinitely. We should look at it practically. We've come up with a date before, but it didn't happen because the conditions were not met," said DAB lawmaker Lau Kwok-fan, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau added putting the plan on hold doesn't mean a stop in waste recycling and education work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Simon Wong who heads the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, told the same programme that the catering industry was concerned about manpower shortages and rising operating costs if the scheme went as planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Five concern groups - including Civic Exchange, Green Power, Greenpeace, The Green Earth, and Greeners Action - wrote to the chief executive and asked for no more delay in the implementation.
