    Hongkong Post urged to boost e-commerce revenues

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hongkong Post says many unforeseen developments have impacted its ability to achieve the budgeted revenues. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750323_1_L_20240424130708.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday urged Hongkong Post to explore measures to boost its revenue in e-commerce services, after the postal department suffered losses from operations in seven of the past 10 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A report by the auditor noted that Hongkong Post also failed to meet the target rates of return on fixed assets for nine years in the past decade.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022-23, the postal department recorded a loss from operations of HK$305 million and a rate of return on fixed assets of negative 13 percent – far from the 1.5 percent target.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Audit officials said local e-commerce services, which were intended to offset loss-making traditional mail services, did not perform well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that the profitability was negative each year throughout the previous five-year period with the deficit being around three-fold of the revenue each year, while Hongkong Post could not attain the budgeted revenue from local e-commerce services for each of the three years in the period from 2020-21 to 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[Hongkong Post] needs to continue efforts in increasing the revenue and the mail volume of local e-commerce services, and explore effective measures to improve the profitability of local e-commerce services," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor cites Hongkong Post as saying it sets an aggressive target for budgeted revenues to motivate staff to maximise revenue generation. However, in the ever-changing business environment, there are many unforeseen developments, especially during the Covid-19 epidemic, which significantly impacted on [Hongkong Post's] ability to achieve the budgeted revenues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor also conducted a check on Hongkong Post's website and found that cross-border postal services for regions in mainland China were incorrectly listed as "international services".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The postal department has since revised such descriptions to "other destinations", according to the commission's report.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A separate examination by the commission showed that service agreements between Hongkong Post and stamp designers lacked specific clauses concerning safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Postmaster General said Hongkong Post attaches great importance to national security and will incorporate such clauses.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The 9th Hong Kong Games began on Sunday with an opening ceremony held at the Coliseum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheerleading, a wushu performance and skateboarding were just some of the spectacles kicking off the biennial sports competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Athletes from the territory's 18 districts entered the venue before table tennis players Minnie Soo and Ding Ning, wushu athlete Samuel Hui and badminton player Wang Yilyu took part in a torch relay, lighting the cauldron together to signify the beginning of the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Raistlin Lau gave the opening speech. He said President Xi Jinping has emphasised the importance of sports for improving people's health and realising the Chinese dream.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The biennial Hong Kong Games is a major sports event for all Hong Kong citizens. This is not only a good opportunity for Hong Kong athletes to show their strength, but also an excellent platform to promote 'Sports for All'," Lau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, the Hong Kong Games has entered its ninth session. I know that in the next two months, there will be more than 4,600 athletes competing in eight events and a total of more than 1,000 games."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inter-district sports event runs until June 9, with competitions in athletics, badminton, 3-on-3 basketball, futsal, swimming, table tennis, tennis and volleyball.

    Cathay to hire more staff, return to pre-Covid level
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Friday said it aims to recruit 5,000 more staff this year and reach 80 percent of its pre-pandemic capacity in the second quarter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The city’s flagship carrier said it is most in need of flight attendants and customer service officers including cargo and ground staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Patricia Hwang, the airline's Director People, said it would also expand mainland and overseas recruitment to hire more pilots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of pilots, right now we have got around 2,900 pilots and we forecast that we need to recruit another 500 to support our rebuild journey and to resume our capacity back to the pre-pandemic level,” she told reporters at a recruitment roadshow event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have got confidence that we will be able to recruit and attract all the pilots that we need to support our rebuild and of course we will not only recruit from Hong Kong, we will also recruit from the Chinese mainland, as well as different overseas countries.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hwang added that more than 100 mainland cabin crew members had been trained and are now providing services since Cathay started hiring from across the border last August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Cathay Pacific pilot union earlier said the carrier is very short of experienced pilots despite its recruitment expansion, warning it could take years for the airline to recover from the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Nazia, a candidate who applied for a customer service post, expressed confidence in the company's prospects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Obviously, Covid-19 was quite an unfortunate event that everyone had to suffer. So I can understand the different pressures on business and different entities. But honestly, looking forward, I think it would be a long term position for me if I do get into Cathay Pacific. I think it's really reasonable for different firms to lay off staff. But I think right now, Cathay Pacific is also doing quite well," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cathay said it wants to achieve full pre-Covid capacity in the first quarter of next year.

    Workers not supposed to enter manhole: minister
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday expressed his condolences to the families of two workers who died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Initial investigations showed the pair inhaled hydrogen sulfide and fainted while working in the manhole. They were later certified dead at the hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said relevant departments were looking into the accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that the Drainage Services Department has started reviewing the safety of similar works, and related works have been suspended," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the Labour Department can conduct a detailed investigation as soon as possible to look into the cause of the accident. We will wait for the result of the investigation before we take follow up actions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that various stakeholders had the responsibility to prevent industrial accidents from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Development Secretary Bernadette Linn said the investigation would focus on the workers’ decision to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Workers should not be asked to enter manholes when they clean the drainage. They just have to spray water with high-pressure from above ground," she said during a Legco panel meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So why did the workers enter the manhole, leading to fatalities? That is one of the directions of the investigation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A code of practice for safety and health at work in confined spaces was first introduced in 2000, and the government earlier said it planned to revise the code of practice in the first half of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau said it had suspended the contractors from tendering for public works related to roads and drainage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The contractors concerned have to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. The contractors are required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures," a spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said the suspension would only be lifted if the contractors demonstrated an effective safety management system.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it plans to let the Airport Authority install an artificial reef off Chek Lap Kok to enhance ecological and fisheries resources there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the reef would provide shelter and nursery grounds for marine life in northwest Lantau waters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project would see around 1,000 artificial reef units deployed around 25 hectares of seabed in the airport's approach area No. 3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project was due to commence mid-year at the earliest and was expected to be completed in the second half of 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Around a dozen artificial reef zones have been installed in Hong Kong waters, including one off Chek Lap Kok that is a feeding station for Chinese White Dolphins.

 The Transport Department said Peak Tram services remain suspended after several trees collapsed near the tracks amid heavy wind on Sunday afternoon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Citybus route 15C, which connects the tram terminal to the Central ferry piers, is also suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department urged people to use other forms of public transport, adding that work is continuing to clear the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said they would notify the public when services resume.

    Police investigate MTR platform jumping stunt

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police say they are looking into a video showing a man jumping from platform to platform at an MTR station.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Footage circulating online appears to have been taken by the man himself as he leapt over the train track at Fo Tan Station on Saturday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The MTR Corporation called in the police on Monday night after reviewing its CCTV footage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company said the two platforms involved are more than two metres apart.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the man carrying out the stunt appears to be between 20 and 30 years old, while CCTV suggests another man of around the same age also filmed what happened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the case has been classified as a breach of MTR by-laws. No arrests have been made.

    Plastic ban gets support but 'more can be done'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Plastic food containers are still allowed for takeaway orders under the new policy. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749984_1_L_20240422154854.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 People were generally supportive of the plastic cutlery ban that took effect on Monday, but some said it was inconvenient and restaurants could do more to protect the environment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, but plastic containers and cups are still allowed for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lamini, an office worker in Wan Chai, said cutting down on plastic products is the right thing to do.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “By removing plastic one by one, I think it can only be positive for our children and future generations. I agree to pay maybe a little bit more to have something made from paper and I think we have to do it now,” he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nevaeh, a student enjoying a drink at a cafe in Admiralty, said she did not mind using a paper straw, even though it became soft after a while.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I got used to it because they only provide paper straws, so you’ll just accept it,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Luk, a worker, said paper straws just do not work and restaurants should switch to reusable ones, like stainless steel straws, for dine-in customers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They should have thought it through and tested the straw first,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I could barely drink from the paper straw. I had to take it out and drink from the glass, because it was flattened.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Michael, the director of a steakhouse in Wan Chai, said he understands that eco-friendly cutlery may not be as useful as plastic cutlery and so he is offering his customers different options when ordering takeaway food.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they want plastic tableware it’ll cost them HK$5. Of course people will prefer to dine in if they’re having steak. If they order takeaways they can ask us to slice the steaks for them,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the owner of a Vietnamese noodle joint said it will switch to paper pulp cutlery in a week or so, when the stock of plastic tableware is used up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she said eco-friendly alternatives are more costly and will make it harder for small businesses to stay afloat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It costs around 30 percent more. But the economy is in a tough shape, how can we transfer the cost onto the customers? They may not come if we put up the price,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We chose sturdier paper tableware because we serve soup noodles... and they’re more expensive.”

    'Let mainland elderly homes join cross-border scheme'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Elderly Commission on Saturday said he hopes the government can allow mainland-operated care homes to join the cross-boundary elderly care scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under current policy, elderly people in queue for subsidised care homes in Hong Kong can apply for care homes in the nine Greater Bay Area cities on the mainland, but only those operated by Hong Kong organisations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Donald Li said by expanding the scheme, the elderly can have more options, provided that a review system is enforced for quality control of service.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most people are concerned about the financial health of care homes, to know whether they can operate in the long term. People are also concerned about the hygiene of care homes, and whether carers received training or not. The government is doing inspections now," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He admitted that the waiting time for elderly care home admission is long, and said places should be allocated for those in need.

 Two men have been arrested after several renovation and engineering companies were scammed out of a total of HK$1.5 million, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the companies were given work on what were purported to be school projects and were persuaded to use particular suppliers for materials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firms were tricked into believing they had received deposits for the work, via forged screenshots of remittance records or cheques that bounced, before they made payments to the "suppliers".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Once the victims made payments to those fake suppliers, they would lose all communication to the [fraudsters] and suppliers. Then the companies eventually realised they had been scammed,” said Chief Inspector Tam Tsz-wai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they arrested two men, aged 33 and 44, in Yuen Long on Friday, on suspicion of obtaining property by deception.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tam urged companies to check with their banks that their account balances increase following payments from clients, to ensure that the transactions have not been manipulated.

    Legco expansion to be completed by year's end

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legco President Andrew Leung on Tuesday said the expanded Legislative Council Complex in Admiralty was expected to come into operation at the end of the year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Four storeys are being added to accommodate offices for the 20 extra lawmakers who joined Legco as part of electoral reforms in 2021, taking the total from 70 to 90 members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, several government officials, and Leung attended the "topping out" ceremony at Legco and visited the newly built 12th floor, marking a milestone in progress on the expansion of the complex.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he hopes Legco members can move into the building by the end of the year so that they can work under the same roof.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Wendy Hong, who is one of dozens of members currently using the nearby CITIC Tower as their temporary office, said it would be more convenient when they moved back to Legco.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I look forward to move back soon because now we have meetings in the Legco building, but our office is in another building," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Sometimes it's difficult for us to arrange [meeting] times. When you have 20, 15 minutes in between two meetings, it's difficult for you to go back to the office and come back [to Legco] again. But now we can go back to office and come back. It's easier to arrange time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction of the new floors began in 2022, with the project costing around HK$400 million more than the original estimate, from HK$1.17 billion to HK$1.56 billion.

    Care teams for minority groups to start work this year

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Sunday said care teams tasked with supporting people from ethnic minority groups will start providing services later this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At an Equal Opportunities Commission event, Cheuk said the government is committed to helping non-Chinese residents integrate into the community, saying they are vital to Hong Kong society.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “They are no doubt an integral part of the Hong Kong family, working dutifully and diligently across various professions and areas. Our non-ethnic Chinese brothers and sisters have made equal contributions to the growth of Hong Kong,” Cheuk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy chief secretary said that as well as the care teams, preparations are underway for two new ethnic minority support centres, in Kowloon and the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said there are over 300,000 non-Chinese people in the SAR, many of them working in various industries including government positions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of employment, the government encourages departments to design their own language tests, to provide an additional pathway for ethnic minority applicants to meet the appointment requirements on language proficiency,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For instance, more than 300 ethnic minority applicants have passed the Chinese or English written examination designed for police recruitment. This would allow ethnic minorities who may not have participated in public examinations in Hong Kong to gain the opportunity to join and work for the government.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk also noted that a pilot counselling service centre for ethnic minority residents launched at the end of last year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The president of the Law Society on Friday said Beijing officials they had met during their visit to the capital approved of their work in safeguarding the rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Wrapping up their four-day trip to Beijing, CM Chan said they had met representatives of 12 organisations, including the Ministry of Justice and the Basic Law Committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the officials praised the society for remaining impartial and professional when discussing major legal issues, and for using simple language to explain the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to members of the public during the legislative process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Law Society understands that safeguarding national security and protecting freedoms is not a zero-sum game. I am very confident that with the judicial independence in Hong Kong, a balance can be struck," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Law Society of Hong Kong submitted a lot of professional opinions to the Hong Kong government during the consultation period. And we got the message that the leaders recognised our work and our contribution in safeguarding the rule of law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that they sought business opportunities during their visit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his delegation visited the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the General Administration of Sport for the first time, to explain how the SAR's legal profession can provide services for the commercial and sport sectors.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Magic mushrooms, marijuana candy and LSD stamps were among a haul of drugs worth around HK$12 million seized in Yau Tong last week, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided a factory building in the area on April 19 and another the following day, after discovering that the sites were being used for manufacturing and trafficking dangerous drugs destined to be sold in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 25-year-old man was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During the operation, our officers seized drugs with a total market value of more than 12 million dollars, including 12.5 kilogrammes of heroin, 8 kilogrammes of marijuana flowers, 270 sticks of marijuana vape juice, 500 millilitres of marijuana oil, marijuana candy and cookies, magic mushrooms and LSD stamps," said Senior Inspector Matthew Fung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our officers also examined tools found in one of the units suspected to be used for manufacturing and packaging the drugs. We believe that this operation has successfully cut off the supply chain of this drug trafficking group."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung said officers were trying to trace the source of the raw materials used to produce the drugs found.

    Emergency appointments halved amid dentist shortage
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of emergency dental appointment slots at government clinics has fallen by almost half since the pandemic, the Audit Commission said on Wednesday, as it called for improvements to services.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a report, the government auditor said there was an annual quota of around 40,000 appointment slots at the city’s 11 public dental clinics in the year 2018/19, but this had fallen to about 20,000 by 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It cited the Department of Health as saying the reduction was due to the pandemic, but also a shortage of dentists.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said it found instances of people queuing up for hours at clinics just to try to get an appointment the following day under the first-come-first served system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At one clinic, people who had pre-registered to see the dentist still had to arrive in the morning to pick up a disc for an appointment that wasn’t until the afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor noted that the government is aware of the public demand for more appointment slots for emergency dental care and urged it to address the manpower shortage and bring the quota back up to at least the level before the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the public spending watchdog said health officials should beef up support for NGOs involved in the Outreach Dental Care Programme, which provides free dental services to elderly people in care homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the attendance rate for the programme needs to be improved, noting that the target of 43,000 service users was not met from 2020/21 to 2022/23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two NGOs served less than half the number of people they aimed to for three consecutive years, the auditor added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city will soon learn the results of a national astronaut selection drive, which includes two positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lin Xiqiang, deputy director of China Manned Space Agency, said on Wednesday the selection of payload specialists in the two SARs has been "essentially completed".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “With the central government's approval, we selected payload experts in Hong Kong and Macau for the first time in the fourth batch of preparatory astronauts selected, and relevant information will be officially released soon,” Lin said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “As for the specific selection results for Hong Kong and Macau, we will inform the SAR governments at the earliest opportunity.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new batch will work with other active astronauts to carry out the follow-up space station missions and achieve China's landing on the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said earlier several Hongkongers have made it to the final round of selection to join the nation’s space programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were among more than 100 people who signed up for the recruitment drive after the agency announced in 2022 that it was recruiting 12 to 14 reserve astronauts for space missions, with two payload specialist positions open to candidates from Hong Kong and Macau for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lin’s remarks came as the China Manned Space Agency announced the launch of the Shenzhou-18 spacecraft on Thursday evening.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Legislators on Wednesday began a three-day debate on the financial secretary's budget blueprint, with many of them praising Paul Chan's efforts to boost the economy despite a deficit of more than HK$100 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Various lawmakers lauded Chan for responding to their demands, such as removing all property-cooling measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB chairman Gary Chan said the financial secretary offered much support to the people and various business sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The budget actively promotes the comprehensive development of our economy. There are measures to support the SMEs in tapping foreign markets. There's also support for IT development. It will build a Hong Kong brand comprehensively," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB chair also said it's high time Hong Kong reviewed comprehensively its advantages and complemented other cities in the Greater Bay Area, so that the region can enjoy development synergies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, Business and Professionals Alliance chairman Lo Wai-kwok described Paul Chan as a "master chef" who came up with "popular and healthy dishes" despite the budget shortfall.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The secretary has been tightening the purse strings while rolling out a series of measures to stimulate the economy so as to make sure government initiatives would be popular. It's not an easy task," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee lawmaker Chan Pui-leung, meanwhile, said officials should look into widening Hong Kong's tax base as soon as possible, noting the public coffers would be hit particularly hard during economic downturns.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A vote on the budget is scheduled to take place in two weeks.

    'Similar accident happened at Sha Tin manhole in 2006'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims says a similar fatal accident happened before in 2006." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750138_1_L_20240423125304.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A workers' rights group on Tuesday said it is angry about the manhole incident in which two workers died, noting that a similar accident happened at the same site before.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said a pair of workers had died in 2006 after working in a manhole on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Construction Industry Employees General Union also said authorities failed to learn lessons from the previous accident, and called on them to review regulations and enforcement practices to get rid of any loopholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's chief executive Siu Sin-man said the Labour Department should ask construction companies to notify authorities before starting work in a manhole so inspections can take place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The system can effectively strengthen the contractors' vigilance because they need to provide many supporting [documents] to the Labour Department to show they have done the best preparations including safety precautions," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the Labour Department knows more about the ongoing projects, there can be better monitoring."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said the Drainage Services Department needs to ensure that contractors fully comply with safety standards by conducting risk assessments, installing ventilators and monitoring equipment in the manholes, as well as arranging safety harnesses for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it is trying to get in touch with the families of the workers to offer assistance.

 The Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) said new ways to increase economic productivity could help retain the SAR's status as a supply chain hub.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “New quality productive forces” — a concept introduced by President Xi Jinping and highlighted in Premier Li Qiang’s work report — refer to productivity increases helped by breakthroughs in technology, rather than in traditional industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, the council's executive director, Mohamed Butt, said new quality productive forces, also known as NPF, could help attract more businesses to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This NPF can empower the growth of new industrialisation, as well as enhance our capability to become a stronger base for exports. I think in the budget speech, the Secretary for Finance mentioned that Hong Kong needs to become an international supply chain hub," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In conclusion, I think NPF can really bring in new people, new ideas, new businesses, and enhance our capability to become a stronger base for supply chain hub for the world."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of HKPC and lawmaker, Sunny Tan, said new quality productive forces could enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about being innovative, being able to apply new technologies in industrial development and the product development side with new products, new materials, new production processes, and also new ways of distribution," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And then, productive forces, really, it's about getting all stages, doing it right with, again, innovation and technology to enhance our competitiveness along the entire supply chain."

    HK doesn't need a 'fake news' law, says CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday dismissed the need for legislation against "fake news", stressing the media sector's ability to improve credibility through professionalism and self-discipline.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee acknowledged improvements in the dissemination of accurate information and praised the efforts of journalists' groups to combat misinformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the media industry is committed to maintaining the integrity of news reporting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will monitor the situation but my take is that if this problem can be addressed by enhancing professionalism, then it should be our first choice. We need to work together. There is no need for legislation. I always think that we can handle this issue with self-discipline as well as professionalism," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE's remarks came after Secretary for Justice Paul Lam told the SCMP in an interview that the government has ruled out introducing a fake news law, an idea proposed by the previous administration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said legislation in this area would be challenging due to complex legal issues surrounding the definition of fake news.

    'San Tin project can hurt black-faced spoonbill site'

<div class="itemFullText">
 Sacrificing wetlands to build a new technology hub in the northern part of Hong Kong could cause "irreversible damage" to the habitat of endangered black-faced spoonbills, an environmentalist group warned on Friday, although it reported a rise in the number of the rare migratory birds found in the city.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society's director, Yu Yat-tung, said wetlands in Hong Kong could not be reduced further, voicing concerns that filing in fishponds for the San Tin Technopole project could result in the largest wetland loss in the past three decades.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking about a zero loss of wetlands. I think this is a very important policy for us to work towards wetland conservation," he said. "We need to make sure that no wetland can be lost in any development projects from now on and the future."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His comments came as an annual census conducted in January by the society found 6,988 of the rare migratory birds across the world – a 5.4 percent rise from the year before – marking the third straight year that such figures surpassed 6,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Hong Kong, 375 were spotted in the latest study, up by a quarter from the previous year. But the number of migratory birds in the territory only made up around five percent of the global population.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The figure] is just returning to the previous, normal range of black-faced spoonbills. In the past 10 years, we could usually have about 300 to 400 black-faced spoonbills wintering in Hong Kong," Yu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the situation can further improve in the coming future, so we need to do many more wetland conservation activities to make sure this can happen."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Taiwan was once again the top winter destination for black-faced spoonbills, with nearly 60 percent of the bird's worldwide population, even though the total number found there dropped slightly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mainland attracted 1,630 spoonbills this year, while Macau recorded the largest decline of 38 percent.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs authorities on Saturday reported a significant increase in cannabis seizures during the first quarter of this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A total of 1.28 tonnes of cannabis was seized, more than half the total seized last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers arrested 31 people, including two teenagers, suspected of being involved in drug trafficking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities have highlighted the various methods used by traffickers to smuggle cannabis, such as hiding it in pet food or secret compartments in wooden tables.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In one recent case, officers intercepted a shipment of car wheels and discovered a hidden stash of 100 kilograms of cannabis, worth about HK$23 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Customs officials said they would continue their efforts to enforce the law by using new technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They noted that cannabis has been legalised in some countries, leading to a misconception among some people that it is harmless and non-addictive.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that the authorities are ready for an influx of visitors during the mainland's Golden Week holiday next month, with preparations in place at immigration control points.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, Lee said almost six million people are expected to enter or leave Hong Kong via the airport, rail and land crossings in the first week of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said special arrangements have been put in place for particularly busy periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The TLB (Transport and Logistics Bureau) and the Transport Department have already been in close contact with the transportation operators, so we'll be in full gear to ensure that there will be good and smooth service for visitors," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll also be turning out officers to take care of the management of tourist groups because we want to spread them out, also to stagger the meal arrangement, so that they will be smoothly absorbed into the whole arrangement at different districts."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that Golden Week will be a good opportunity to show people that Hong Kong is a vibrant city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want the experiences of the visitors, that of course includes tourists and also maybe a result of the activities of local spenders, to have a good experience, both in taking meals, in shopping, in all kinds of services, businesses," he said.

    HK to launch climate disclosure roadmap this year

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Monday said Hong Kong is on track to becoming one of the first jurisdictions to adopt sustainability disclosure requirements in line with global standards, as the government vowed to do more to support green energy transition in the region.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a forum to mark Earth Day, the finance chief said the government is committed to launching a roadmap this year to align local sustainability disclosure requirements with the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also pointed out that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will soon release a local green classification framework that aligns with rules adopted by the European Union and the mainland to combat so-called “green washing”, the act of providing misleading information about products’ environmental benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan noted the SAR could do more to support green transition finance in the region, which would involve investing in green sectors and projects, as well as assisting carbon-intensive industries in their net-zero transformation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have the expertise, infrastructure, and regulatory framework that support international investors and different transition projects,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “There’s clear room to explore how Hong Kong could better help channel capital to support the transition of high-emitting sectors and heavy polluting industries in the region,” he added.

    Environmental survey for new tech hub plan approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Advisory Council on the Environment has listed eight conditions, after it approved the environmental impact assessment for the San Tin Technopole project. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750021_1_L_20240422193418.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An advisory council on Monday conditionally approved the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the San Tin Technopole project, despite heavy criticism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Green groups had last week called the report the worst wetland assessment since EIA regulations came into place in 1998.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Advisory Council on the Environment approved the EIA at a meeting, but it listed eight conditions, including the submission of a habitat creation and management plan (HCMP) to the Environmental Protection Department nine months before pond filling works begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other conditions included setting up wildlife corridors with a diameter of at least ten metres wide, submitting a plan on enhancing wetlands in Mai Po, and setting up an environmental committee to monitor the implementation of ecological mitigation measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Terence Tsang, the department's assistant director, said authorities will ensure the eight conditions will be met throughout the development of the tech hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is a very stringent mechanism to review that submission. Also, if in case the effectiveness of the measures recommended in the HCMP was found to not achieve the expected results... there is some kind of monitoring mechanism," he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green groups said the EIA had missed two species of breeding birds and also did not share the actual number of black-faced spoonbills counted in the survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Additionally, they said that the assessment had violated at least 35 statutory requirements and omitted crucial data points.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They also said the report should be resubmitted, as the area for the San Tin Technopole project had been expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But council chairman John Chai said that that would not be necessary as the assessment already covered issues like ecology, fishponds and wetlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Despite that there is a difference in the area, the coverage of the development, the environmental issues that need to be studied have not changed... So in other words, it's the same kind of study," Chai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the development, environmental groups said they were highly disappointed by the decision, stressing that the San Tin Technopole project will cause irreversible damage to wetlands.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, they said the conditions laid out by the department did not specifically address the deficiencies in the San Tin EIA report, which they regarded as "invalid, incomplete, unscientific, and unreliable".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Construction work for the tech hub will begin late this year.

    Officials advised to learn lessons from toilet saga

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials tasked with revitalising countryside areas are being urged to learn lessons over a HK$13 million "smart toilet" which turned out to be anything but.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Users of the toilet in the New Territories village of Lai Chi Wo were promised a hands-free experience, with the amenity boasting automatic sliding doors that opened and closed with just a wave.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After almost two years of construction, the toilet was completed in the summer of 2023 and was trumpeted as a showpiece facility that could boost the image of countryside washrooms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it all went down the pan not long after it opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On 9 December 2023, a user was locked up inside the new public toilet as the automatic sliding door could not be opened by waving hands over the control panel or pressing the emergency button," the Audit Commission noted in a report on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was later discovered that special panels installed on the roof of the toilet, which were meant to purify air as well as generate electricity, were not producing enough power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The auditor said the automatic door system was subsequently disabled and the sliding doors converted to manual operation "to restore the public’s confidence over the usage of the toilet".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It noted that as well as supposedly being "smart", the toilet was also originally estimated to have been almost HK$5 million cheaper than it was.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Audit Commission said the Countryside Conservation Office responsible for the project should draw on the experience it gained with the toilet when it embarks on other minor improvement works in the future.

    '70 percent of eateries still using plastic items'

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector leader on Monday said about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 18,000 restaurants are still handing out plastic cutlery, despite the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics coming into effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government says it won't issue fines for breaches of the ban over the next six months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The president of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said many small and medium-sized restaurants are still using plastic, because it's cheaper than alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong told an RTHK programme that he hopes people will get into the habit of taking their own cutlery with them when they go out for food, so they don't have to pay extra for eco-friendly options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cost may be passed on to some people, because they may have to pay additional fees. However, I hope that people can, in the future, get into the habit of using their own tableware. It would be best if they can bring their own cutlery, as that way neither party needs to consider the matter of cost," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ban also means hotels can no longer provide guests with free plastic items, including disposable razors, toothbrushes and shower caps.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Backchat programme, the executive director of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners, Caspar Tsui, said the industry is struggling to find alternative products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There has been a little difficulty in changing some of the products. Not because we were not willing to do it, but mainly because, you know, it's difficult to find sufficient suppliers and the quality of products that we need to maintain the service," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We're adjusting slowly, not because we don't want to, but it takes time."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Edgar Cheung and Siobhan Haughey were named the "best of the best" at the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards on Wednesday, both of them claiming the honour for the third time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The nominated athletes swapped their tracksuits for dresses and suits to walk the red carpet at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai for the annual event dubbed the Oscars of the local sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Swimmer Haughey was named the SAR's top female athlete, with some of her accomplishments including winning the city's first World Aquatics Championships medal by finishing second in the women's 100 metres freestyle final, and taking home two golds, one silver and three bronzes at the Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of this summer's Paris Olympics, where she's hoping to better her two silver medals from the Tokyo Games, she said this award gives her the motivation to work even harder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very honoured to win this award especially since we have so many amazing athletes in Hong Kong, and I think it's a great motivation for me leading up to the Olympics, and also it's really nice that we have this awards ceremony because it kind of recognises all the athletes' hard work," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a nice occasion for all of us to dress up. It's nice seeing all the athletes not in their workout attire. It's a mini gathering before the Olympics. We get to celebrate all of our achievements from before, but then now we get to focus on what's really important which is the Olympics. We still have a few more months away, and I think we're all just trying to work hard, train hard and try to do our best at the Olympics."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the women's category were table tennis player Doo Hoi-kem, karate athlete Grace Lau, fencer Vivian Kong and three-time world snooker champion Ng On-yee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, fencer Edgar Cheung won the best of the best on the men's side after snatching gold in the foil at both the World University Games and the Hangzhou Asian Games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joining him on the stage in the men's category were rising golfer Taichi Kho, badminton player Chu Man-kai, table tennis ace Wong Chun-ting and emerging tennis star Coleman Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung said he was especially thankful for his coach, team and family's support to get him to the Olympics once again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That means a lot to me because from what I see in the video just now, for the whole year, we fought to give our best to get a better result," the Tokyo gold medalist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three groups were given Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards in the Sports Combination category, covering small teams and duos. One of them was the men's foil team of Cheung, Ryan Choi, Leung Chin-yu and Yeung Chi-ka, who won bronze at the World Championships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they were happy to win the award, even though they did not qualify for the Olympics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are very honoured. It's kind of like a comfort, so we hope we continue to do better, and maybe make another history [moment] in the next year and the coming years," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other winners in the sports combination category were the badminton mixed double pair of Jordan Tang and Tse Ying-suet. It's the fourth time the duo were honoured in the category, but it's the first time Tang has been able to make it to the ceremony. He said it was a memorable occasion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has been a hard but important year for us. Our results weren't ideal prior to Olympic qualifications. It was only from last May that our condition and results slowly got better," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But now that we have a ticket to the Olympics, it is definitely great motivation. We need to thank everyone for their support in helping us get this award. Thank you."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third winner of the sports combination award belongs to the men's rowing pair Lam San-tung and Wong Wai-chun. Wong said the award is a sign of their improvement in the past two years and an affirmation of their Asian Games gold medal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said, "Since I just announced that I am retiring, I would say this is the best reward for my retirement. I've been in competitive rowing for 10 years now. At the age of 24, I want to step outside my comfort zone, try new things, and find a different way to repay society."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The men's football team, who reached the semi-finals at the Asian Games and featured in the Asian Cup, claimed the team awards for the first time in eight years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Head coach Jorn Andersen said he hopes to see football continue to grow in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I want to say that it is very important that we have so many young players who take the step. And many young players who take the achievement in the front, to improving in the front. And to be part of the Hong Kong team in the future, so we that maybe again we can make some good results," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The trial of Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai on Friday heard he intended to groom a key figure linked to the 2019 unrest, Finn Lau, to become a "political star", but that Lau was cool to the idea.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Testifying for another day as an accomplice witness, paralegal Chan Tsz-wah spoke about a meeting in Taiwan in January 2020 that he, Lai, Lau and others attended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial heard the Apple Daily founder wanted to cultivate Lau by offering him £10,000 in living expenses and helping to build a political network, with the aim of causing the collapse of the Chinese government and economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said Lai's anti-China policy also included economic blockades and sanctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the court was told that Lau "did not want to become a political star".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said Lai wanted to support political newcomers in the pan-democratic primaries in the 2020 Legco elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The former media tycoon has denied three conspiracy charges relating to collusion with foreign forces and sedition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The trial continues.

    Unionists issue 'Labour Day Declaration'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Unionists on Wednesday called on the government to improve labour protection, boost benefits for public servants and increase the city's minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Nine labour and civil service unions issued a "Labour Day Declaration" ahead of May 1, with 10 policy suggestions, including an end to further labour imports and improving occupational safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council, Lee Kwok-keung, said the city’s minimum hourly wage should be increased by HK$15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “While our proposed increase from HK$40 an hour to HK$55 seems substantial, we should bear in mind the fact that a basic lunch can easily cost HK$55. If the minimum wage doesn't even cover the cost of a meal, it's not really reasonable,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, meanwhile, noted a recent 0.1 percentage point increase in Hong Kong's unemployment rate, meaning an extra 9,400 people – 111,700 in total – were out of work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who is also the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, urged the government to provide a job-matching service for businesses participating in labour importation schemes, with the aim of getting them to prioritise local people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Federation of HKSAR Civil Servants, Lee Fong-chung, said there is a need for the government to come up with policies to address staff shortages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the annual retirement rate for senior government positions has hit 10 percent and there has been a "huge" number of resignations in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We think it's very important for the government to refill the vacancies as soon as possible, through regular recruitment or transferring some contract [workers] onto permanent terms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the number of government workers in their 20s and 30s resigning has been particularly high and more family-friendly policies are needed to keep hold of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Like [increasing] maternity leave… And also, the government may amend some policy on the long-term investment for the civil servants, like they can use a portion of their pension fund for them to buy a house or to buy medical insurance,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chairman of the Government Employees Association, Cheung Hoi-wing, added that many civil servants have chosen to retire in mainland cities in recent years and the government should extend civil servant healthcare benefits to cover the whole Greater Bay Area.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government's office for attracting skilled workers to the city will host a global talent summit and expo at the Exhibition and Convention Centre in Wan Chai between May 7 and 8, to encourage more people to move to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Director of Hong Kong Talent Engage, Anthony Lau, on Tuesday said nearly 100 firms, public bodies and government departments were expected to take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 20 people will share their outlooks on the global job market and talent movement trends, as well as opportunities and exchanges in the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said admission is free, and locals can also take part. The event will be broadcast live online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said his office would provide information on different talent entry schemes, as well as support services for non-locals on how they can move to Hong Kong, offering advice on issues such as housing and education for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau noted that in the past year, finance and IT were among the sectors that attracted the most non-local talent to Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For talent coming to Hong Kong, most of them are very interested in tips on every-day life. They also want more opportunities to learn Cantonese and practice the language," Lau told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said with Cantonese classes being so popular, his office would hold dozens more of them this year.

    New growth charts introduced after 31 years

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health authorities on Monday said they are updating how they measure children's growth for the first time since 1993 to reflect the fact that today's young people are typically taller and heavier.
 <br>
  <br/>
  New charts are being rolled out to help check how a child's weight, height, body mass index and head circumference compare with those of their peers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Thomas Chung, from the Department of Health, worked with colleagues from Chinese University and the University of Hong Kong. He said there was a clear trend upwards in the height and weight of children and adolescents in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we compare the new charts, HK2020, with that of the old charts, HK1993, the median height of boys and girls at age 18, they are two centimetres taller than those in the median height of the same age in 1993," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There may be many factors like nutrition, and improvements in society, so this is expected and seen in other places in the world as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung also said they compared their current data to data routinely collected by the health department to validate and discover trends, adding the pandemic did not affect their results.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We collected more than 21,000 data from children and adolescents to construct the new Hong Kong 2020 growth references. These growth charts contain nine centile lines, as compared to the seven centile lines in the old charts," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two additional extreme lines help frontline professionals have a more accurate and detailed assessment on the growth of the children, so that they can be referred to other specialists if necessary."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Tony Nelson, a paediatrics specialist from Chinese University, said it was important to check local data instead of relying on global studies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of our local data showing that infants are lighter at birth and girls are slightly shorter, I think this just reflects the importance of local data," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So our local data shows that for the Hong Kong population, it's not like the WHO study, which was from six countries globally and included countries like the Netherlands, and India, and America, and other places. So I think this just reflects the local genetics, the local population here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health will start using the new growth charts in maternal and child health centres in July, and in student health service centres in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hospital Authority will implement them in phases starting in September, and aims to have them in all its facilities by the end of the year.

    'Restaurants to utilize non-plastic grace period'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="During a six-month grace period, government officials will focus on educating people rather than strictly enforcing the ban. File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749810_1_L_20240421091008.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A representative of the catering industry on Sunday said that many small and medium-sized restaurants will continue to use plastic utensils despite the upcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hashtag Hong Kong, Simon Wong, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, said many restaurant owners will take advantage of a six-month adjustment period after the ban takes effect on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  During this time, government officials will focus on educating people rather than strictly enforcing the ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many restaurant operators are, at the moment, not eager to use non-plastic tableware as the government is giving a six-month grace period to the trade, such that operators will not be fined if they do not follow the regulation on and after April 22," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, it would give enough time for importers and wholesalers as well as retailers to consume or deal with their inventories within the allowable period. This period would also offer more time for the catering industry to find more suitable products to suit their budget and needs."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong mentioned that large restaurant chains would be the first to switch to non-plastic alternatives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he added that small and medium-sized restaurants are concerned about the increased costs in the current tough economic climate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong noted that eco-friendly options are currently 20 to 30 per cent more expensive than plastic utensils, but he believes the cost will come down in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He urged the government to step up education and public awareness campaigns to inform people about the importance of reducing waste and protecting the environment.

    Don't let blunders affect digitalisation: Sun Dong
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1749610-20240419.htm
   </link>
   <description>
    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, on Friday said he hoped government departments and public bodies would keep rolling out digital services, despite various hiccups over the past year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a special finance committee meeting in Legco discussing this year's budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien asked about accountability issues, after seeing problems with apps to do with sports venue booking, tunnel tolls and public exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tien noted these tech hiccups made it seem as if “Murphy's law” was coming true — "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and has gone wrong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said in recent months, the government had required new services to go through third party stress tests vetted by its top IT office, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the latest problems had made officials think about extending stringent tests to public bodies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said there are hundreds of government departments and public bodies, so it's impossible for the office to cast an eye on everything, adding the IT teams of some government departments were actually bigger those at the OGCIO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As authorities continue building a digital government and a smart city, Sun said the system must change, and the future Digital Policy Office to be formed will steer policies, besides offering technical support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The IT chief said despite the shortcomings, he hopes officials won't "shrink back" and would continue to play their part in the city’s ongoing digitalisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All good policies are drawn up on the basis of blunders, painful lessons learned. So we need to look forward, we must not be hesitant because of the blunders and problems," Sun told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the minister said the government's planned artificial intelligence supercomputer centre at Cyberport would operate under a market-driven model, with clear pricing policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said while the government has yet to seek public funding for the centre, Cyberport has raised funds for the project with help from the administration, because of its urgency and what he called abrupt changes to the international situation last year.

  The goal remains for the centre to open this year, Sun said.

    Businesses need not worry about plastic ban: official

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Tse Chin-wan says some small eateries he recently visited have bought non-plastic cutlery for their customers. Photo courtesy of Tse's blog." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749829_1_L_20240421115143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment and Ecology Secretary Tse Chin-wan says businesses do not have to worry too much about a ban on plastic tableware that takes effect from Monday, as it's not the government's goal to "punish" them with the policy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, the official said vendors can use up their plastic products during a six-month grace period so they will not be wasted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that even when the grace period ends, authorities will educate vendors first in case of violation, instead of taking enforcement action immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that a process of changing customs is needed, and it will take time for businesses to adjust the way they operate to comply with the ban. So, we will try our best to provide appropriate assistance when implementing the policy," Tse wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said the catering, retail and hotel sectors all support the measure that will see restaurants banned from selling and using polystyrene tableware and plastic cutlery, while hotels will no longer be allowed to provide free plastic products like toothbrushes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said many hotels have switched to wooden toothbrushes and combs, while some eateries have bought non-plastic cutlery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on restaurants to choose suitable eco-tableware, noting that there have been concerns that paper pulp cutlery might become unusable when soaked in hot liquids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are many choices in addition to paper pulp, including wood, bamboo, bagasse pulp, wood pulp and straw pulp. Local restaurants serve a wide variety of food, and they should choose suitable tableware based on the different dishes they serve," Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that restaurants will not be required by law to charge customers for non-plastic tableware.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA) said all DSE exam centres must return unused question-and-answer books to the authority starting from Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The announcement came after the English listening exam paper was said to have been uploaded to social media platform Xiaohongshu, and police arrested a 23-year-old woman in relation to the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman for the HKEAA said for exams held on Saturday onwards, the centres must return all unused question-and-answer books to the collection centre on the same day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKEAA said the arrangement would help manage examination materials more effectively and minimise the risk of information being made available publicly on the internet.

    'Precautions also apply to sites near manholes'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A construction union group's safety adviser says people working near manholes can also be exposed to a high concentration of gas. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750303_1_L_20240424112457.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Safety measures for working in confined spaces also apply to sites connected to manholes, a construction group said on Wednesday, following the deaths this week of two sewer maintenance workers who were suspected to have been exposed to toxic gas in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the pair, who are thought to have inhaled hydrogen sulfide, were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee Kwong-sing, a safety adviser with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union, said people working near a manhole could also be exposed to a high concentration of gas when the cover is opened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [hazardous] gas is concentrated enough, people near the manhole may have a chance of inhaling a high concentration of toxic gas... and possibly faint and fall into the manhole," Lee told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said current regulations stipulate that precautions are required for people working in a confined space and also in the vicinity of the site.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, workers were using high-pressure water jets near the manhole," Lee said. "So one can't say because workers are not going into the manhole, there is no need for precautionary measures."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing said the government needs to tighten up guidelines for people working in confined spaces, including more stringent tests on hazardous gases and mandatory video monitoring of workers inside manholes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Tuesday evening said a revised code on working in confined spaces would be ready in one to two months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam, who chairs the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, agreed with suggestions that construction companies should notify authorities before work starts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those small-scale construction works, related to high-risk tasks such as [working in] confined spaces and manholes, you also need to report and notify the Labour Department," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, contractors are not required to submit project reports to labour officials in advance if such work will involve at most 10 workers and will be completed within six weeks.

    'Common sense for hep B patients to get antivirals'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Renal specialist Lui Sing-leung (left) and Professor Grace Wong (right) appear in court as expert witnesses. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749998_1_L_20240422164817.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 It is “widely known medical knowledge” that hepatitis B patients taking steroids should also be prescribed antivirals, a renal specialist told the Coroner’s Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lui Sing-leung, who chairs the Hospital Authority’s central renal committee, also said a doctor who treated liver disease patient Tang Kwai-sze should have detailed the discussions on the use of steroids during a consultation session in his medical notes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had been taking steroids to treat her chronic kidney disease before she underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017. She died in August that year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for allegedly failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Giving evidence on Monday, Lui said while the Hospital Authority had yet to issue a guideline on antiviral prescription for non-cancer patients at the time of Tang’s steroid treatment, it was “widely known” that such drugs should be given to the patient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also told the inquest, before Coroner Monica Chow and a five-person jury, that Lam’s notes only said the patient was briefed on the “pros and cons of steroids” and agreed to using the drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Lam should have written down clearly the pros and cons of steroids that he had highlighted, because [relapse] is an important, serious potential complication,” Lui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lui added that doctors who see the same patient subsequently might only rely on the previous medical notes, but not the hospital’s clinical management system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan, the other doctor who later saw Tang, did not follow up with the patient as to why antivirals had not been prescribed when he should have, the court heard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another expert witness, Professor Grace Wong from the Chinese University’s medical school, agreed that a hepatitis B flare-up, in which the level of liver enzymes rises abruptly, is mainly caused by the absence of antivirals during a high-dose steroid treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong, a specialist in gastroenterology and hepatology, said a study she’s part of found that even short courses of a large dosage of steroids could increase the risk of a hepatitis flare-up, and such patients should receive antivirals regardless of the duration of the treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also said while it should be “common sense” to prescribe antivirals along with steroids, the practice was not written “in black and white” before the patient’s case came to light, so one could not expect all doctors to follow as such.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The inquest hearing continues.

    Civil service chief vows to recruit new blood

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung says the SAR administration can only hire public servants locally. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749724_1_L_20240420090645.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, has vowed to go the extra mile in hiring new public servants, while acknowledging recruitment has not been easy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's "Your Home Address" programme broadcast on Saturday, Yeung said the civil service workforce currently has about a 10 percent vacancy rate, due mainly to a shortage of labour in the market and the period being the peak of retirement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the administration could only hire locally, but made it clear it's working hard to recruit new blood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can trawl from the home base, I can only use local talents... Almost all employers in Hong Kong are snatching talents from each other, and the local graduates are very welcomed by employers in every sector," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So we have to make extra efforts in recruitment and we have been making extra efforts. Last year, we have launched this scheme of allowing students in their penultimate year of study, not in their final year of study, to apply for civil service jobs as well."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also said the aim of a planned updated code of conduct for civil servants is to spell out what is expected of public workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is in the civil servants' daily work when they come into contact with different political parties, with politicians, that they should remain neutral. With regard to the government's work, with regard to what the government is doing, they should support wholeheartedly. There is no room for them to say that, 'Oh, I'm neutral, I do not support and I do not object to this government initiative,'" Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the draft Civil Service Code, which includes 12 core values and standards of conduct, civil servants must not refuse to implement government policies they do not agree with, or adopt a passive attitude in implementing them.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said new measures announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to cooperate with Hong Kong's capital market demonstrate the central government's support for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said the commission will support leading mainland companies in listing in Hong Kong, by stepping up communication and coordination among government departments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The official said he learnt during a trip to Hangzhou and Suzhou last week that many companies have applied to list in Hong Kong, or are considering doing so.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the companies like Hong Kong for its institutional advantages, including intellectual property protection and internationalisation, as well as the synergy with other Greater Bay Area cities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They hope to use Hong Kong as their preferred springboard and platform to enter the international market, including establishing treasury centres and even international headquarters in Hong Kong," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief said having more companies with great potential listed on Hong Kong's bourse will attract more international capital and solidify the SAR's status as an international financial hub.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said that some technology firms from Hangzhou are also setting up research centres in the SAR as the two cities are about to establish a platform for technological collaboration.

    Initial response to plastic tableware ban positive: CE

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the initial response to a ban on plastic tableware has been positive, adding the government would monitor the supply and price of alternative products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking a day after the first phase of a citywide ban on single-use plastics took effect, Lee said it takes time for people's behaviour to change.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are aware that these alternatives cost about several cents or 20 cents or so. So they are affordable. I do believe that they will not be too costly in the operation of businesses," he told reporters before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is an international trend to move away from plastic. Alternative products have been developed over quite some time. We have just started the regulation of plastic tableware. We do hope that Hong Kong people will understand that it is our responsibility to protect the environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added the Environmental Protection Department had provided a list of around 700 suitable non-plastic alternatives for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first phase of the ban prohibits the sale and use of disposable polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Tuesday said it strongly opposed and disapproved of a report by the United States on the human rights situation in Hong Kong last year, calling it "unfounded and biased".
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman of the SAR government said it condemned repeated US attempts to politicise human rights in the so-called annual human rights report by the US State Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The HKSAR government strongly demands that the US immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs," the spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration is against the wanton slander on Hong Kong where the One Country, Two Systems principle is successfully implemented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman added that the SAR's laws on national security clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected.

 The Department of Health on Saturday said it had ordered the Union Hospital to hand in a report after hackers attacked its computer system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Responding to media enquiries, the department said it was notified by the hospital on Monday about the cyberattack, which affected operations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said initial understandings showed that the incident did not involve patients' information or affect the safety of hospital services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities said the investigation is ongoing and it had ordered the hospital to submit a detailed report within a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital earlier said it had reported the case to the police as well as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, and announced it had stepped up measures to prevent further attacks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The hospital has activated an emergency response system and stepped up cybersecurity measures to block further intrusion. A team of cyber security experts has been appointed to conduct a thorough system inspection and recovery in order to ensure medical service continuity," it wrote in a statement.

    First trial under UN anti-terrorism law gets underway

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750185_1_L_20240423173240.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first-ever trial under a United Nations anti-terrorism ordinance got underway at the High Court on Tuesday, over an alleged attempt to plant bombs and shoot police officers in 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Lai Chun-pong and Justin Hui deny "conspiracy to commit bombing of prescribed objects", while Lau Pui-ying has pleaded not guilty to a conspiracy charge relating to providing or collecting property to commit terrorist acts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the court that the defendants had planned to plant two bombs during a rally marking International Human Rights Day in December 2019 – one on Hennessy Road in Wan Chai and the other around 100 metres away.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first bomb was designed to make police move to where the second was planted, the prosecution said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the second bomb was bigger, with a power radius of 400 metres, and it contained 150 iron nails which would have caused serious casualties and property damage had it been detonated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The defendants also planned to shoot police officers, the court was told.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution told the nine-person jury that Cheung Ming-yu, Hui and Lai received military training in Taiwan in September 2019, and that the trio also went up a hill in Sai Kung to test their guns three weeks before the day of the planned attack, which police say they foiled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution's witnesses for the trial include a co-defendant who pleaded guilty, Wong Chun-keung, who is said to have been the leader of the group behind the alleged bomb plot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the first time that Hong Kong authorities have brought a prosecution using the anti-terrorism ordinance since it was enacted in July 2002.

    Government condemns statement by G7 foreign ministers

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749768_1_L_20240420173156.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Saturday strongly condemned a statement issued by foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and the High Representative of the European Union, saying it deliberately misled the public and smeared the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman described the statement as "unfounded and biased". He stressed that it was Hong Kong's constitutional duty to safeguard national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many common law jurisdictions, including western countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Singapore, have enacted multiple pieces of legislation to safeguard national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Turning a blind eye to the fact and making exaggerated remarks, the G7 foreign ministers and the High Representative of the EU have demonstrated typical political hegemony and hypocrisy with double standards."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The G7 statement expressed concerns about civil and political rights and freedoms in Hong Kong in light of the introduction of the National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance under Article 23 of the Basic Law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government spokesman dismissed the criticism, saying that the legislation would not affect normal business operations, adding that law-abiding businessmen and travellers visiting Hong Kong would not engage in activities that endanger national security and therefore would not unknowingly violate the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that a majority of the submissions received during the public consultation on the legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law were supportive and positive, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation.

    Surprise checks were effective: labour officials

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The special inspection squads, set up by the Labour Department, have conducted checks on almost 660 sites over the past few months. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1749661_1_L_20240419185619.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Friday said special task forces set up to inspect construction sites have initiated more than 340 prosecutions against unsafe practices over the past few months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The inspection groups, established by the Labour Department following a number of fatal industrial accidents, also issued nearly 800 improvement or suspension notices, after conducting checks on almost 660 sites between November 2023 and February this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting, lawmaker Chau Siu-hung asked if the administration had assessed the effectiveness of the inspection squads and whether authorities plan to deploy them again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commissioner for Labour May Chan said in response that the work of inspection squads had been effective.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We conduct inspections through the special task forces, and also through other means. We put in a lot of resources to carry out inspections by special task forces. We also hold surprise checks or random inspections. We have yielded results through these surprise checks," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As to whether we will ask the special task forces to carry out more inspections in the future, we will look into it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, deputy commissioner for labour Vincent Fung said officials will do more to promote a revised code of practice for bamboo scaffolding safety which was gazetted on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amendments stipulate that those working on bamboo scaffolds must undergo training and hold a valid certificate. The revised code also prohibits any unauthorised alteration of scaffolds.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Considering the time required for the industry to arrange training to obtain the certificates, there will be a grace period of six months on the effective date of the revised [code of practice]. It will take effect on October 19 to allow the industry to have sufficient time for preparation," a department spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The updated guide was published two months after a large scaffolding collapsed at a construction site in Kai Tak, killing two workers and injuring three others.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Trees came down in several parts of the city, some rail services were disrupted and the observatory reported a waterspout on Sunday, as strong winds and thunderstorms battered Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Peak Tram stopped running after a tree came down on Barker Road, while another fell on Wylie Road in Ho Ma Tin, temporarily blocking traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There was disruption to East Rail Line services for around an hour in the afternoon, with emergency maintenance work taking place at University Station after the wind apparently ripped away part of the canopy above one of the platforms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said some high-speed train services between Hong Kong and the mainland would be delayed due to the bad weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, speed limits on the bridge to Macau and Zhuhai were reduced due to the high winds, the Transport Department said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Amber Rainstorm Warning was issued at 10am and while it was cancelled at 1.45pm, a thunderstorm warning remained in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said intense gusts reaching 80 kilometres per hour or above could continue to affect the territory, as it also warned of possible flooding from rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At around 9.30 in the morning, a waterspout was spotted in Clear Water Bay, the observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that more thundery showers are forecast throughout the rest of the week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, authorities in Guangdong warned of the risk of floods from rivers, waterways and reservoirs after days of torrential rain.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials in localities and municipalities across the province were told to begin emergency planning to avert any disasters.

    Insufficient load test led to DC poll glitch: EAC

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A technical team behind the electronic poll register system, which failed during December's District Council polls, did not conduct sufficient load test on the programme, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) concluded on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a report on the citywide polls, the watchdog also recommended the Registration and Electoral Office to identify experts in fixing the system's issues and run simulations of a large-scale election regularly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last year, the glitch led to authorities extending voting hours by one and a half hours, and polling stations switching to printed copies of the voter register to issue ballot papers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report noted that design issues of the electronic poll register system caused the central processing unit to overload and unnecessarily tied up a substantial amount of resources in the server when electoral staff tried to log in to the programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When altering the system design, the [Registration and Electoral Office's] technical team did not fully consider the cumulative effect and impacts on loading that might be induced to the system during actual operation, and therefore did not conduct sufficient and comprehensive load test," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission said the electoral office should identify suitable experts to rectify design issues and conduct "adequate, comprehensive and stringent tests", while running simulated large-scale elections on a regular basis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [Registration and Electoral Office] should learn a lesson from this system failure, and actively implement the above recommendations to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in future," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As to whether any individual officers should be held responsible for the incident, it will be followed up by the administration according to the established procedures."

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750346_1_L_20240424152230.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Health Bureau said on Wednesday that officials plan to look into the feasibility of expanding a mental health support hotline to other platforms, such as instant messaging apps.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 18111 hotline which launched last December has been receiving around 350 calls per day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written reply to the legislature, Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau said those seeking help wanted to talk about issues such as mental distress, family relationships, physical health problems and work pressures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the hotline operators have referred around 200 people to different organisations for support, and two urgent cases to the police.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said officials have been regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the service and it could be expanded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the outcome of the review of the operation, we will consider the feasibility of extending the service to other platforms (such as instant messaging software) in consultation with the Advisory Committee on Mental Health in due course," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister added that officials plan to ask an independent organisation to conduct a full service evaluation study in the third quarter of the year, to collect views from NGOs and other stakeholders through questionnaires and focus groups.

    Audit Commission urges rehabus to scale up services

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750361_1_L_20240424164335.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Audit Commission on Wednesday called on a minibus operator catering for the disabled to beef up its services, saying it turned down requests for pre-booked trips even though vehicles were available.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In its report, the watchdog said the government-subsidised rehabus operator rejected 21,425 orders for door-to-door transportation in 2023, double the figure recorded in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But there were on average nine to 42 spare vehicles on a weekday from 2019 to last year, the body said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commission added that around one-fifth of the 121 fixed routes averaged six or even fewer passengers a month, while the waiting list for services had become longer, with someone on it for almost two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Routes running between hospitals, clinics and MTR stations operated by another company were also under-used, the watchdog said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among 12 hospital routes, three were transporting zero passengers 80 percent of the time in 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said the operators should review their routes and improve patronage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added the Transport Department should look at requests to purchase more rehabus vehicles carefully, noting the operators did not report on the utilisation of existing vehicles when asking the government for funding to buy new ones from 2021 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  124 vehicles costing HK$135 million in total were procured from 2018 to 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner for Transport, for her part, said she agreed with the audit recommendations.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Sunday explained its decision not to hold a march on May 1, saying members don't want one and it has come up with "more effective" channels for workers to express their opinions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group hasn't held its customary Labour Day march since before the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The some 400,000 members and 200 unions gathered on the platform of the FTU to promote labour values and the labour spirit. We are holding a series of activities in the upcoming week simply because that's what workers want. Not holding a march doesn't mean we are avoiding anything," said FTU president and lawmaker Stanley Ng.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think those activities are more effective channels to let workers express their opinions," he told reporters at a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU chairman and lawmaker Kingsley Wong said as part of its Labour Day campaign, the group has invited senior government officials, including Chief Executive John Lee, Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun, to meet frontline workers from various industries to learn about their needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the group will also submit proposals on labour matters to the government next week.

 Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan on Saturday said most people think the upcoming waste charging scheme is causing a nuisance to the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government began testing the scheme at 14 locations from this month, including at public and private residential blocks, and people involved in the trial were provided with free designated garbage bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a television programme, the minister said about half of the residents living in private residential blocks participated in the test run, but only ten percent of those living in three-nil buildings joined the trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that opinions on the scheme vary.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A few residents reflected that it's good to do waste separation and reduction. But a majority of them thought it's causing nuisance to the public because they have to pay for rubbish bags," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said it remains to be seen whether the scheme will go ahead as planned on August 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first phase of the ban on plastic tableware will start next Monday, and restaurants will be barred from selling and using disposable polystyrene tableware, plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about people reflecting that paper and wood cutlery were difficult to use, Tse said it takes time for people to get used to tableware made of different materials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the catering sector may find various substitutions for plastic tableware.

    NGOs need to show commitment to patriotism: govt

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Friday said it's not hard for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to meet the requirements for a new social welfare subsidy allocation system which rewards support for government policies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Groups would score higher if they had organised or co-hosted activities supporting official policies in recent years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a special Legco Finance Committee meeting discussing the budget, Roundtable lawmaker Michael Tien said people have asked him for clarity on the matter, and he didn't know the answer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Sun said the new system encourages NGOs to show their commitment to patriotism, and it doesn't matter what kind of activities are involved, so long as the groups took part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want these NGOs to love our country and love Hong Kong," he told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, for our National Day, or after 'The Two Sessions', the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, maybe the NGOs can organise some seminars to share the ideas proposed in these meetings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the minister stressed the government had no plans to scrap the HK$2 transport subsidy scheme for the elderly and the disabled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration has started a review of the system after expenditure for the scheme in the current financial year was projected to increase by 50 percent year-on-year, to more than HK$6 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed as officials hope to complete a review this year, they would consider ways to extend the scheme in an affordable manner.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted the policy’s intent was to encourage the elderly to go out more, to benefit their mental health and relationships.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the government was aware there were different views on the issue and it would try to balance them.

    More talent needed to boost I&amp;T sector: Sun Dong

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said on Sunday that Hong Kong's shortage of talent in the innovation and technology sector will improve with time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment on a radio programme after 59 local, mainland and overseas enterprises signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said dozens of tech enterprises have expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics technology sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, he said, there is a lack of manpower in the industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I feel that we are certainly lacking talents in this area, but it's already getting better. We have plans to attract talent through the Technology Talent Admission Scheme and the innovation and technology institutions set up," he told Commercial Radio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "All the innovation and technology policies we have launched can attract and train local talents, so I believe if we continue in this direction, we will have more and more talents in the next few years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stressed that policies implemented must be consistent with the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, to boost high-quality development in the field.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the government is aiming to roll out a scheme in the third quarter of the year to encourage people to rejoin the workforce.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme announced in his policy address in 2023, elderly and middle-aged people who have not been in paid employment for three consecutive months or more will be entitled to an allowance after working for at least six straight months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at an event organised by the Federation of Trade Unions marking the upcoming Labour Day, Lee also said the government will fine-tune the review mechanism of the city's minimum wage, as part of measures to better protect the rights of employees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He hailed their contributions to the city’s economic and social development, noting that authorities are going all out to stimulate the economy while improving people’s livelihoods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This year's Labour Day is the first Labour Day in the SAR after the enactment of Article 23 of the Basic Law... We can [now] spare no effort to fight for the city’s economic growth, pursue development, improve people's livelihoods, and have all wage earners pursue happiness in a safe and stable environment,” he said.

    Two workers die in manhole gas accident

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An investigation has been launched after two sewer maintenance workers died in a manhole in Sha Tin.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities say early indications are that the pair, and two other men who also fell ill while working in the manhole, inhaled hydrogen sulfide.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department said the men were employed by a contractor to clean sewers using high-pressure water jets, but their work should not have required them to enter the manhole.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Firefighters were called at around midnight to reports that the workers had fallen ill while operating three to four metres underground at the Yuen Wo Playground.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two men are said to be 26 and 34 years old. They were declared dead at the Prince of Wales Hospital. The two other workers were also treated at the same hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it had ordered a halt to work at the site and paused all similar work elsewhere until it could conduct safety checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s also launched an investigation and promised to work with the Labour Department and the police, who are also looking into the case. It's been classified as an industrial accident.

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Liberal Party leader Tommy Cheung on Saturday expressed a positive outlook for local businesses for the upcoming Labour Day "Golden Week" holiday on the mainland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung, who represents the catering sector, said he expects an increase in the number of mainland tourists staying overnight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that restaurants have increased their staff in anticipation of a surge in number of visitors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because it's a five-day holiday for China, so I'm expecting more people to come. In fact, not just for the first of May, even second, third, fourth and fifth," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I'm expecting more people coming in than going out. We are prepared for the week."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cheung expects a forthcoming ban on the sale and use of disposable plastic tableware to be implemented smoothly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said many restaurants had already understood the new regulations and were making the necessary preparations to adapt to the changes.
