    Clear Water Bay Road reopens after repair work
   </title>

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Transport Department said early on Monday that Clear Water Bay Road was back to normal, after being disrupted by a landslide.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A slope measuring 30 metres long and 40 metres deep collapsed, and part of the pavement also caved in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The slip forced officials to implement an arrangement in which two-way traffic shared the same lane near Wing Lung Road in Hang Hau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung said earlier that Clear Water Bay Road should be open again by rush hour on Monday morning, after workers carried out remedial work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said workers were spraying concrete onto the slope, and more work would be carried out later to further consolidate the structure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When we open the road, we have to ensure it's safe after the temporary consolidation work. If we can't do that, we won't open the road," Lam told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we'll have measures in place. Our contractor and the Highways Department will keep monitoring the situation here. We'll also liaise with the observatory to see if the weather will worsen, and we've installed some sump pumps in case there's heavy rain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities received 14 other landslide reports on Saturday, when the amber and red rainstorm warning signals were in effect for most of the day.

    People attempt bun tower climbing in Cheung Chau
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A climbing carnival took place at Cheung Chau on Sunday, ahead of the island's traditional bun-scrambling competition on Buddha's Birthday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 14-metre-high bun tower frame is already in place for the competition on May 15, and carnival-goers were given the chance to see whether they could climb it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung said her son had managed the feat.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We've tried bun scrambling over the years. When my son was young, he couldn't reach the top. Last time we came, he was able to get there at a slow pace with the help of his dad. But this time, he was able to do it all by himself very quickly," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was so happy to see him achieve that because yesterday it was raining really hard so I thought there wouldn't be a chance. Luckily the weather is beautiful. It's a lot of fun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ms Chung's 13-year-old son has now climbed the tower at least four times. He gave his advice on the best way to approach the climb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There isn't a specific technique to climbing. You just have to grasp the bamboo tightly and watch your footing. I love experiencing Hong Kong culture. I want to preserve and pass on Hong Kong culture like bun scrambling so more people know about it," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I personally love eating lucky buns and watching bun scrambling on television, so I really wanted to see if it is actually that exhilarating in person, and see if it's really that easy or difficult."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another visitor, Ms Lok, said she brought her friends from overseas to the carnival, so they could experience a bit of Hong Kong culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We were shaking while climbing because the gaps are so small, but we had a lot of fun. Huge respect to those who can climb up so quickly. I think this is a great tradition to preserve, and I love the meaning behind it," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can pass peace to anyone, even if you aren't Chinese. My friends wanted to experience something quite traditional and this definitely checks the box."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, workers have been working hard to reconstruct the three traditional giant bun towers for display ahead of next week's festivities, after Saturday's heavy winds caused the bamboo scaffolding to collapse.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung Chi-ming, chairman of the Hong Kong Cheung Chau Bun Festival Committee, said it would take one to two days to complete, but progress was going well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have never experienced the collapse of the bun tower scaffolding before. It was because the heavy winds hit it down. It is quite a rare incident. The latest situation is quite ideal. We thought it would take three to four days, but they've sent more people to help so the speed has increased significantly," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I arrived at eight in the morning and everything has already been dismantled, and ready for reconstruction. I think everything can be restored in one to two days. I believe it will be reinforced this time around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung also said the incident had incurred a cost, but he had not yet calculated how much money was involved. He added it was most important the Bun Festival runs smoothly next week.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Government bureaus and departments have been asked to review their data security measures and give a reply within a week. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751873_1_L_20240505145341.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's top IT office on Sunday said it was asking all bureaus and departments to comprehensively review their data security measures, and reply within a week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after reports of two data leaks in the past few days, involving the Companies Registry and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The registry said on Friday the data of some 110,000 people had been exposed due to a fault in its digital platform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The day before, the EMSD apologised over the data leak of some 17,000 public housing residents who had to undergo mandatory Covid tests in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the issue on social media, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said it's highly concerned about the incidents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it had again sent clear directives to the heads of bureaus and departments about the reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also reminded all users and systems under the departments that they must stringently comply with the government's rules, policies and guidelines on data security in handling sensitive and personal information," it said in the post.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added this includes never storing data on publicly-owned cloud platforms.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chris Sun says while adjustments will be made to the scheme, officials will try to minimise the effects on beneficiaries. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751866_1_L_20240505125439.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Welfare minister Chris Sun said officials don't plan to change the eligible age and coverage of the HK$2 transport subsidy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government plans to complete a review of the scheme by the end of 2024, as its bill is expected to increase by 50 percent, to more than HK$6 billion this financial year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said while there's a need to make changes to the scheme to ensure it is more financially viable in the long run, officials would keep several aspects of this "good policy" unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The overriding principle is that the original intention of the scheme doesn't change - those benefiting from the scheme, that is elderly people aged 60 and above and the disabled, this won't change," the minister said on a TVB programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government did not plan to ban the more expensive bus and minibus trips to the border, saying beneficiaries have gotten used to the travel convenience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun said officials would try their best not to make it troublesome for the beneficiaries, or affect their willingness to travel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that officials would do more to tackle abuses by those who are not eligible for the scheme, and do more promotion to encourage beneficiaries to take cheaper rides whenever possible.

    Golden Week tourists to boost city by HK$2 billion
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said the total number of mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong should reach the estimated 800,000 mark with the Golden Week holiday wrapping up on Sunday, adding it would boost the economy by over HK$2 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said approximately 670,000 mainland tourists had already come to the territory in the first four days despite the rainy weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The entire Guangdong Province was affected by the unstable weather, and tourists can see that the weather is also not that good in Hong Kong, so they may postpone their trip. However, the overall numbers aren't bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that we will reach our estimated number of tourists. If we have around 800,000 mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong, I think we can earn over two billion dollars in consumption. Even though we have only reached about 700,000 people so far, we should still reach over two billion dollars."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Responding to the mixed reviews of the Labour Day pyrotechnic display, Yeung said it was no surprise that people had expectations for the fireworks show, but the weather was unpredictable in how it would affect the viewing experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Rain is hard to predict, unlike wind which comes when it comes. Even if you see rain clouds, you don't know if it will actually rain. So up until 4pm of that day, we then decided it was appropriate to host the show," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was watching from the top of a bridge where the wind was hitting so from the start of the fireworks, the smoke did reach me. However, from other viewing angles, people have sent me clear and beautiful photos of the show."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added they would learn from this experience and do better in terms of publicity and expectation management in the future.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan is attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in Tbilisi. Photo courtesy of Chan's blog" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751862_1_L_20240505115210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said Hong Kong's economy was maintaining its momentum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan said the city’s GDP had increased five quarters in a row, with growth going up 2.7 percent year-on-year in the quarter ending in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Market sentiment had also improved, he said, with the Hang Seng Index gaining almost 14 percent recently after going up for nine consecutive days, while the property market had become more active after measures to curb speculation were lifted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said inbound tourism was one of the key drivers of the economy in the first quarter, adding the number of arrivals during the first three days of Golden Week, which stood at nearly 650,000, was up 25 percent from last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the minister said external uncertainties remained, and that higher interest rates and a strong Hong Kong dollar would affect the city's tourism sector, as well as export and investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on companies to develop new products to explore new ways to manage their businesses, noting that authorities were helping SMEs to go digital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief, who was attending the Asian Development Bank's annual meeting in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, said many participants were interested in the development of the digital economy as well as the innovation and technology sector in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added authorities recently published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, to provide a clearer definition of green products and help the sector reduce "greenwashing" risks.

    Care teams deployed after heavy rain hits Sai Kung

<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said 12 care teams have been deployed to Sai Kung in response to the severe rainfall that hit the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At one point, the Observatory recorded over 200 millimetres of rain in the district, causing significant flooding on several roads, including Po Lam Road North and Wan Po Road in Tseung Kwan O, as well as Pak Sha Wan Street in Sai Kung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The home affairs minister said some care team members were already on duty in temporary shelters while others were checking the district for floods and reporting to the Sai Kung district officer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also dismissed claims that some care team members didn't turn up when the rain was at its hardest on Saturday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Care team members are volunteers and they are fully dedicated to their work. However, during periods of heavy rainfall and when there are floods, the responsibility for addressing standing water and flooding falls to the government's professional departments,” she said. “I think the general public don’t expect care teams to deal with the floods without the necessary equipment.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that most floods in the district had been dealt with before noon and most roads affected had been reopened by 2 pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the Home Affairs Department had opened nine temporary shelters across Hong Kong for people in need of temporary accommodation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory cancelled the amber rainstorm warning signal at 8.45pm on Saturday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said heavy rain over Hong Kong had started to ease. The Observatory had issued the amber signal to replace the red rainstorm warning just before 4pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the forecaster has also warned that another intense band of thundery showers is edging towards the Pearl River Estuary, and this might still affect Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red signal had been in place since about 9 am and, at around noon, the Observatory warned it might issue its maximum black signal as even heavier rain started to fall across Hong Kong, especially in the east.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Drainage Services Department said it mobilised about 70 emergency response teams to handle flooding, involving over 160 emergency response teams comprising about 600 people. It said that by 7.30pm, all 16 flooding cases, including 12 in the Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O areas, had been resolved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Geotechnical Engineering Office said it received 15 reports of landslides in the Sai Kung area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fire Services Department said that as of 7pm it had handled 25 reports of people trapped in lifts, and 71 reports from automatic fire alarm systems. It said fourteen people were evacuated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it received 22 reports of fallen trees with no injuries as of 8pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Home Affairs Department said it had opened nine temporary shelters located in Southern District on Hong Kong Island, Yau Tsim Mong and Kowloon City in Kowloon, and Tseung Kwan O and Sai Kung in the New Territories.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday rescued two groups of hikers near Sai Kung, as heavy rain fell over Hong Kong, particularly in the east.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said a group of 11 mainland tourists, including seven children, contacted police at about 11.30 am, after finding themselves stranded at High Island Reservoir East Dam. They had previously been camping in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about the same time, rescuers were also called in by four local hikers who found themselves in difficulty on section two of the MacLehose Trail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force said they were able to locate all of the stranded hikers, and evacuate them, adding that none of the 15 were injured and that they didn't require hospital treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory issued the first Red Rainstorm Signal of the year just before 9 am, before saying it was considering issuing the higher Black Rainstorm Signal at around noon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At 10.30 am, the forecaster also issued a Landslip Warning, reminding people to stay away from steep slopes, and to stay at home.

    Dozens of cars damaged as TKO car park floods

<div class="itemFullText">
 Dozens of cars were damaged by flood water at a car park in Tseung Kwan O on Saturday, as heavy rain continued to fall over Hong Kong, leading the Observatory to consider issuing a Black Rainstorm Warning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  “For that particular outdoor car park area, there are around 450 cars. I think half of the cars were seriously [flooded]," said district councillor Christine Fong in an interview with RTHK. "Some of them, the water was up over the tyres, even up to the engine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fong also said the car park, on Wan Po Road in Lohas Park, didn't have a reputation for flooding so many drivers had been caught out.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said the east of the SAR had borne the brunt of the rainfall with over 200 millimetres of rain falling in Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Road flooding in those two areas also meant that only limited services could be provided at two out-patient clinics there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Home Affairs Department says it has opened temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Observatory had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am following a night of rain, leading to the suspension of classes at all schools.

    New minimum wage formula to protect labour: Sun
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1751766-20240504.htm

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Labour and Welfare Chris Sun on Saturday said the new minimum wage formula will provide support to Hong Kong's 17,000 low income workers, who currently earn an hourly rate of HK$40.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new formula - which bars any reduction - takes effect next year, after being given the go-ahead on Tuesday by the Chief Executive, John Lee, and the Executive Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a Commercial Radio programme, Sun said the reform balanced the interests of both labour and employers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It has taken into account, on the one hand, the need to protect those earning a minimum wage, that their wage is being protected; and also, at the same time, to ensure that the formula is affordable, and also acceptable to the business sector," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier the labour minister told an RTHK radio programme that the government would enhance safety awareness following the deaths of two sewer maintenance workers, who are believed to have been exposed to toxic gas in a manhole last week in Sha Tin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sun stated that new guidelines for those working in confined spaces, to be announced this month, will make it mandatory to install CCTV at the entrance and exit of manholes.

    Restaurants see 10pc drop in business on May 1 holiday
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Catering sector representative Simon Wong on Saturday said restaurants saw 10 percent less business than usual this May 1 public holiday, which was also the first day of the mainland's Golden Week break.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after appearing on a radio programme, the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades president said this was partially due to 20,000 fewer mainland arrivals on that day, although the May 1 firework display had helped trade near Victoria Harbour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We see that business in some areas in Hong Kong - like in Tsim Sha Tsui, Mong Kok, and along the harbour - because of the fireworks, recorded some increase," he said. "I did visit several districts in Hong Kong and saw that there were not too many people visiting shopping malls.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that reduced spending power among individual travellers and the bad weather during the week contributed to the lower sales. He also attributed the lower sales to many locals heading north.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a hotel group says the occupancy rate for its two hotels also dropped about six to seven percent when compared to last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alan Chan, the operations officer of Miramar Group, said the group had offered substantial price discounts to retain hotel guests, with prices per night decreasing by approximately 23 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For the hotel industry, if we need to drop prices by 23 percent to retain a certain occupancy rate, I think it’s not really ideal,” he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that this year, many mainland flights had resumed to other countries, and visa requirements had also been relaxed for mainlanders, giving them more travel options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan urged the government to liaise with mainland authorities to further expand the Individual Visit Scheme so more mainlanders could visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The five-day mainland holiday will conclude on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Immigration Department, arrivals on May 1 reached 460,000, with over 180,000 coming from the mainland.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday said it may issue the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, as heavy rain continues to batter Hong Kong, particularly in the east of the territory. It had issued the Red Rainstorm Signal just before 9 am, as the rainy weather that has hit Hong Kong over the past few days worsened.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sai Kung and Tseung Kwan O have seen very heavy rain with the Observatory saying more than 200 millimetres have been recorded and that severe rainstorms would continue to affect the eastern part of the SAR. It also warned people to stay away from watercourses across the territory due to the possibility of flash floods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a Hospital Authority spokesman for the Kowloon East Cluster said road flooding meant only limited services could be provided at the Mona Fong General Out-patient Clinic in Sai Kung and the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the government had called on the public to report flooding to the Drainage Services Department following wet weather overnight. There have been reports of flooding and a fallen tree in Chai Wan, and flooding on Silver Cape Road in Tseung Kwan O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Schools have also been told to make sure conditions are safe before allowing students to leave, while all classes have been suspended for the afternoon
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has also told employers to make arrangements for staff.

    Hui flags SAR's strength as a wealth management centre

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says that the government is taking steps to enhance Hong Kong's attractiveness as a wealth management and capital formation centre in order to consolidate the city's position as a leading global financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address programme, he noted that one of the key measures introduced was the Capital Entrant Admission Scheme, which allows individuals with capital of more than HK$30 million to become permanent residents after residing in in Hong Kong for seven years. This scheme has received a positive response, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He discussed efforts to facilitate capital formation, including the reduction of stamp duty for the stock market and the reform of the Growth Enterprise Board, which focuses mainly on small and medium-sized enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a very competitive edge as the equity and also bond raising platform for different corporates. So in that context, we have a number of measures laid out and actually implemented phase by phase to enhance the appeal of our capital market," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hui stressed that amid global geopolitical changes, people are looking for ways to diversify their assets, adding that Hong Kong can seize the opportunities arising from these challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the city is a very attractive option for individuals to invest their capital and channel investments through Hong Kong to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a wealth management and capital formation centre was evident with more than 2,700 single-family offices already established in the city.

    HA sponsors new round of overseas podiatry training
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1751619-20240504.htm

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) is launching a new round of its overseas training sponsorship programme, fully subsidising eligible participants to earn a bachelor's degree in podiatry at the University of Northampton in the UK.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The scheme to send people abroad for training on foot treatment was first introduced in 2005 due to the lack of recognised programmes among local tertiary institutions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stanley Wan, who works as a resident podiatrist at Yan Chai Hospital, participated in the programme in 2014 and joined the HA in 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He had graduated with an engineering degree, but decided to switch to a new career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In terms of my profile, I think I'm not really as good as other competitors, which could possibly already have a degree related to chemistry or bio-engineering,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But I think I showed the interviewer that I have great determination of preparing myself. I applied for the course of physiology, trying to learn something that I probably [did not] know before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also I participated in my church activities, which mainly serve the elderly.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two or three places are on offer each year, and successful applicants must commit to working for the HA for at least five years upon graduation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Priscilla Poon, the HA's chief manager of allied health, said applicants actually find the requirement attractive because Hong Kong doesn't have its own podiatry registration process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think it's a kind of encouragement to them… For those graduates who have graduated in the UK – despite the fact that they are able to register in the UK – [but because] there’s no registration in Hong Kong, there won't be any guarantee of job opportunities,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But if we ask them to serve in HA at least for five years, I think that will be a very positive message for them… they're still able to get a very good pay and a very good job opportunity in HA.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Poon said the HA currently employs 54 podiatrists, but lost about 5 percent of staff each year in recent years due to retirement or resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that while the current staff level is sufficient, Hong Kong's ageing population is expected to increase the demand for podiatrists further.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory on Saturday issued a flood warning for Sai Kung district as more than 100 millimetres of rain fell in Tseung Kwan O in an hour.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The warning was issued at about 5.25am. The weather forecaster said that with more than 70 millimetres of hourly rainfall fallen or expected to fall, there was a risk of serious flooding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The warning was updated at 5.40am to note the heavy rain in Tseung Kwan O, with the Observatory saying people should be on high alert
  <br/>

  "Residents who are likely to be affected are advised to take necessary precautions to avoid possible flood damage," the Observatory said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Heavy rain may bring about flash floods. People should stay away from watercourses. Drivers should beware that there are likely to be serious road flooding and traffic congestion."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The thunderstorm warning was also in effect.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Companies Registry on Friday said the personal information of around 110,000 people had been leaked due to a fault in its digital platform.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The registry said if people conduct searches on its e-Services Portal and pressed the F12 key, they might see additional personal details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Information being exposed included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, as well as full identity and passport numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The body said urgent maintenance has been carried out to prevent further leaks, and that it is getting in touch with and apologising to those affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that it is consulting the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer with a view to conducting a comprehensive review of the incident and taking further enhancement measures to safeguard personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it is launching a probe given the number of people affected in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department apologised after information of around 17,000 public housing tenants required to undergo Covid tests in 2022 was exposed online.

    Strive and Rise helps teens grow: survey

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-commissioned study has found that teenagers who took part in its mentorship scheme found the programme beneficial – having improved their financial planning skills, confidence and sense of belonging.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Polytechnic University researchers spoke to around 2,600 grassroots teenagers, who joined the first phase of the Strive and Rise programme that paired them with mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The junior secondary students on average gave themselves a score of 4.22 out of 6 on financial planning after completing the year-long programme late last year – 12 percent higher than before they joined the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey also showed the teenagers describing themselves as becoming more confident, feeling a greater sense of belonging, as well as developing stronger interpersonal skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press conference summing up the first phase of the programme, one of the participants, Li Ching-po, said he learnt how to make small talk when meeting someone new.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that he had used the HK$10,000 allowance provided by the programme to pay for his violin lessons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With the support and encouragement from my mentors, I found my dream of becoming a great violin teacher," he said. "I hope I'll become an accomplished violinist and fulfil my dream."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan, who had been overseeing the programme, said he was happy to see the participants' growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He brushed aside criticism that some teenagers did not get to see their mentors often.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We know that not every mentor has a lot of free time on their hands. [But] they signed up on their own, and I believe they wanted to do this and knew they had to devote some of their time. Our records show that the mentors and participants met 12 times a year on average," Chan said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I can say that most of our mentors were very responsible."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the government wants to keep the scheme running, and serve a total of 12,000 participants by the year 2025-2026.

    Sha Tin trunk road plan gets Legco green light
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Officials say the trunk road is needed to cope with the growing population in New Territories East. Photo courtesy of the Civil Engineering and Development Department." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751680_1_L_20240503190556.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Legislative Council’s Finance Committee on Friday approved a funding request for a controversial HK$6.8 billion plan to build a new trunk road in Sha Tin to relieve traffic in the area.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sixty-one lawmakers voted in favour of the plan and three voted against, with 12 abstentions after a four-hour meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The estimated cost of the “Trunk Road T4” project was lowered by around five percent from the original HK$7.1 billion after concerns were raised over its hefty price tag.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plan is to build a dual two-lane trunk road of around 2.3 kilometres and connect major roads on both sides of the Shing Mun River.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Transport minister Lam Sai-hung told the Legco meeting that the trunk road is needed to cope with the growing population in New Territories East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The population of New Territories East is expected to increase further. Trunk Road T4 is therefore important in the context of the overall transport infrastructure planning and also serves a regional function," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And it is anticipated that the major roads network in New Territories East will gradually not be able to meet the transport and logistics needs in the short-to-medium term."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, a number of legislators, including Peter Koon from the Election Committee, questioned whether the plan is needed or is worth the money.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we have monetary resources, of course it'd be okay. However, when the government budget is in the red, when we need to solve traffic congestion problems in peak hours, can we really solve the problem? If we need to resolve the bottleneck in Sha Tin and you're simply moving the bottleneck to elsewhere, other areas will still be affected,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Connie Lam, who represents the New Territories South East, also had reservations about the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This T4 road actually is a bit out of budget and it's not a suitable time to build. We have to strike a balance between how to control the expenditure of the government and the needs of the residents there,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials said they’ve already scrapped a proposed elevated cycling track across Shing Mun River, and reduced the number of elevators at footbridges to minimise costs.

    Part of DSE Chinese history exam optional from 2026
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1751644-20240503.htm

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Friday said students taking Chinese History in the DSE exams will be allowed to skip part of the test from 2026.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the new arrangement, pupils can choose to take only a compulsory test that covers Chinese historical events ranging from the ancient Xia dynasty onwards, or they can also sit a paper that focuses on the political, religious, social and other aspects of different periods.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students only sitting the compulsory paper will be able to get a grade 5 at most, while those who sit the two papers can get up to 5**.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said students will not need to disclose to the exam authority if they are skipping a test, so they will not be labelled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it has not consulted the sector extensively on the move because the syllabus and assessment method are not being changed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said they want to give students more choice.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to allow more students who are interested to take Chinese history, or let students study the subject according to their ability," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course teachers will need to think about how to allocate lesson time and take care of students of different ability levels. I believe this won't be difficult as we implement the change and teachers become experienced."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teachers will need to have a teaching plan ready when the new academic year starts in September for form five students who plan to only take the mandatory test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho Hon-kuen who heads Education Convergence, a body consisting of teachers and principals, said it will not be hard to cater to two groups of students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the students can study in the library while others spend more time in the classroom. Or, if the teachers and principals are more dedicated, they can break the students into two groups and teach them separately," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee Wai-hung, a senior Chinese history teacher at Fukien Secondary School (Siu Sai Wan), said it may be difficult to split students into two groups when there are not many taking the subject.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Observatory on Friday said Hong Kong has just experienced the warmest April on record, with the hottest day reaching almost 32 degrees Celsius.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The monthly mean temperature was 26.4 degrees – 3.4 degrees higher than usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory said the hot weather was down to a warmer than normal sea surface temperature and unusually strong southerly air flows over the northern part of the South China Sea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Affected by an anticyclone aloft and the subsequent southerly airstream, it was generally fine and hot during the day from April 11 to 17. With plenty of sunshine, the temperatures at the observatory rose to a maximum of 31.9 degrees on the afternoon of April 13, the highest of the month,” it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster added that the SAR was also a lot wetter than usual last month, with total rainfall of 257.1 millimetres – almost 70 percent more than usual.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on Friday said less than half of households participating in a trial run of a pay-as-you-throw scheme have been using the designated bags for rubbish disposal.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said between 20 and 50 percent of households have been making use of the bags since they were given them last month, with the rate even lower in buildings that aren't run by management companies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the department said most of the care homes, restaurants and government buildings taking part in the trial scheme have adopted the designated bags.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said they are aware that some businesses have seen their operational costs rise due to using the bags and officials will report these concerns to lawmakers on May 27.

    Data of 17,000 public housing tenants leaked

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The data of around 17,000 people who were required to undergo Covid tests at the peak of the pandemic has been exposed online, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) has warned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the department said names, phone numbers, identity card numbers and addresses of residents were collected during lockdown operations between March and July in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The information was stored on an online server accessible to authorised staff using a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on April 30 this year, EMSD was told by the city's privacy watchdog that some information was accessible without the need for a password.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents of 14 public housing blocks are affected including those living in Yan Ching House of Kai Ching Estate in Kai Tak, Oi Ming House of Yau Oi Estate in Tuen Mun and Fu Leung House of Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data said it will launch an investigation but has not received any complaints so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think the situation is serious. We will initiate an investigation according to our normal procedures. We also suggest that the relevant department inform the affected individuals as soon as possible, given the relatively large number of people impacted," Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung told an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EMSD apologised for the incident, adding that it will notify the households affected by mail and "there is no evidence that relevant data has been published so far".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The matter has been reported to the police, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Security Bureau.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Thursday said they believe a suspected burglar, who died after being found unconscious at Lantau's Sea Ranch, had fallen from height.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the mainland man, who's 37, crossed the border on a two-way permit on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They suspect he was part of a gang of three burgling homes at the isolated resort.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Residents from five homes reported that their place had been broken into, with HK$7,000 and some cigarettes missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said two of the suspects had returned to the mainland on Wednesday, and they would seek help from their mainland counterparts if needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they found a trail of blood from one of the blocks at the resort, adding the deceased had a blow to his head, with his jaw and teeth broken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An autopsy would be conducted to establish the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers added they had received four reports of burglary at Sea Ranch since last December, and investigations were ongoing. No arrests have been made over those cases so far.

    SFC begins insider dealing case against hedge fund

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's securities regulator says it has started an insider dealing prosecution against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751549_1_L_20240502212148.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) on Thursday said it had started criminal proceedings against hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its founder, director and chief investment officer Simon Sadler, and former trader Daniel La Rocca for the offence of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company prior to a block trade in June 2017.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the SFC said the two defendants appeared at Eastern Magistrates' Court on Thursday and the case was adjourned to June 12.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, a British businessman, is also the owner of Blackpool Football Club which competes in England's EFL League One division.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Established in 2007, Segantii is one of the oldest and biggest hedge funds in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart from Hong Kong, it also has operations in London, New York and Dubai, according to its website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement on its website, Blackpool Football Club said the charges were entirely unrelated to the club, and its day-to-day operations would not be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that Mr Sadler will vigorously defend himself against the charge, and there will be no further comments at the time from the Club," the statement added. (Additional reporting from Reuters)

    RTHK launches new programmes in May

<div class="itemFullText">
 Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is launching a series of new programmes from May, covering topics from news and current affairs to youth, family, and community activities, as well as education and culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new programmes will be broadcast across RTHK's eight channels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the launch ceremony on Thursday, RTHK’s assistant director, Vincent Lee, said RTHK is committed to innovative production, nurturing new talent, and recruiting skilled individuals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that over 80 new employees joined the public broadcaster following multiple rounds of civil service recruitment conducted in recent months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that pure audio content was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of the public and the broadcaster would utilise more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to visualise radio programmes and distribute content across different platforms to reach a wider audience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, he said RTHK’s productions would deepen its connection with the mainland to tell good stories of Hong Kong and China - as 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK would also provide comprehensive coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, as well as the 2025 National Games, through television, radio, and new media platforms, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  RTHK's director of broadcasting Eddie Cheung, vice chairman of the Board of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority Bernard Chan and chairman of RTHK Board of Advisors Lam Tai-fai also attended the ceremony.

    Inland Revenue expects 12% rise in tax collection
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Inland Revenue Department on Thursday said it expects a 12 percent increase in the amount of tax it collects this year, following a drop last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Provisional figures show the department collected HK$342 billion in the last tax year, which was HK$18.2 billion or about five percent lower than in 2022-23.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But it said it expects tax revenue to rise to HK$382 billion this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said stamp duty revenue is likely to hit HK$71 billion this year, following a 30 percent decrease to HK$49.1 billion last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commissioner of Inland Revenue Tam Tai-pang noted that the city's "spicy" property cooling measures were scrapped in February.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The year 2023-24 had seen a significant drop in property market transactions... and that contributed largely to a significant drop in the stamp duty collections for the year," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We understand that after the abolition of all the demand-side management measures for residential properties, there's a notable increase in property transactions."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said it has sent out about 2.44 million tax returns for individuals for the 2023-24 financial year. People have until June 3 to post them back, or until July 3 if the returns are filed via e-Tax.

    Waste-charging trial to continue this month: govt

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the pay-as-you-throw trial would continue this month as planned, despite feedback that cleaners and participants are having a hard time with the scheme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government selected 14 buildings and premises to test the waste-charging scheme, which began last month, with participants using designated garbage bags and tags to dispose of their rubbish.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government had earlier delayed the scheme's full rollout from April to August.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Warner Cheuk, said that there were still many problems with the trial, and that there must be "public consensus and favourable conditions" to roll out the scheme smoothly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said officials were aware the scheme had increased the workload of cleaners and that some participants found it troublesome, adding the government would carefully look into these matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they would faithfully report these issues to lawmakers at a meeting planned before the end of this month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The waste charging scheme really affects the whole population," the minister said after attending an event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "How can we implement it so that everyone can accept it, and people won’t find it too much of a disruption, so the scheme can run smoothly -- these are all things we need to think about."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the minister said a six-month grace period for restaurants to continue giving out single-use plastic utensils should be long enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From April 22, eateries had to switch to alternative utensils, but they can still give out plastic containers for takeaways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said those who had yet to switch had told officials they were trying to clear their plastic stock, or were waiting for the alternatives to arrive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said officials would visit smaller eateries in the coming months to see if they need any help.

    Consumer Council criticised over privacy breach
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung on Thursday criticised the Consumer Council over a data breach last year, saying the watchdog contravened the Personal Data Ordinance with its deficiencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An attack by hackers resulted in the leak of personal data on more than 450 individuals, including staff members and people who filed complaints with the council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung's office said the council started allowing staff to connect to its server using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when work-from-home arrangements were introduced during the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the council failed to enable multi-factor authentication for the remote access and a hacker group obtained the credentials of a user account before deploying ransomware in the council's servers and endpoints.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a press briefing, Chung said the council had not taken all practicable steps to protect personal data.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The protection given by this multi-factor authentication would be enhanced to over 99 percent if this feature is enabled," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that two weeks passed before the council realised there had been a breach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The cybersecurity solution was supposed to send an email alert to the council once it detected any cybersecurity attack. However, in this case, after the incident the council discovered that the cybersecurity solution was not properly configured," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That was why even though it detected the attack in question, it did not send any email alert to the council for this particular incident, and that was why the council only discovered the cyberattack on September 20 [last year]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has served an enforcement notice on the council and has ordered it to submit proof within two months that it has adopted improvement measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the council said it attaches great importance to cybersecurity and has adopted various measures since the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[The measures include] enabling multi-factor authentication for remote data access via VPN, conducting a comprehensive review of the cybersecurity solutions' functions and appropriate settings, and further strengthening internal training to enhance staff's awareness and behaviour on cybersecurity," it said in a statement.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A think tank on Thursday urged the government to improve the quality of public housing as supply catches up with demand.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Our Hong Kong Foundation said it expects the average waiting time for a public flat to fall from the current 5.8 years to 4.6 years by 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The foundation’s vice president, Ryan Ip, said 35,000 units are expected to be completed each year in the next five years, exceeding the government's long-term target of 30,800.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The total completion of public housing in the next 10 years, no matter which scenarios, it can fulfil the government's own targets. So, with this overall background, then we can sort of move from quantity to the quality side," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, first of all, we advocate for a steadily increasing of the size of housing units of public housing in the next five to 10 years.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for private housing, Ip said the supply will remain stable even though the government saw a record six failed land tenders last year.

    Shoppers delight amid weak yen

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A weak yen spells good news for Hong Kong holidaymakers in Japan but experts say that could hurt inbound tourism. File photo: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751467_1_L_20240502122135.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 With the ongoing slump in the yen which sank to a new 34-year low earlier this week, Japan has seen an influx of Hongkongers taking advantage of the weaker currency and snapping up everything from designer goods to daily necessities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday, the yen fell to 160 to the US dollar before recovering. The Japanese currency was down some 10 percent since the start of the year and 30 percent from three years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Hong Kong travellers have been visiting Japan since the end of the pandemic, and the trend is not about to end anytime soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The yen is very cheap right now, so it’s a great time to go shopping here,” said Maggie Kwong, a Hong Kong banking professional who went to Tokyo for her second trip to Japan this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For example, I went to buy a pair of running shoes... Usually the shoes would cost around HK$1,000, but I was able to buy it for just under HK$500 for the same pair of shoes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So definitely, the fact that the yen has weakened has given me more motivation to come visit Japan and to spend more."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Steve Huen, executive director of EGL Tours, told RTHK that the number of Hongkongers travelling to Japan was up 20 percent in both March and April compared with a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said a weaker yen does not necessarily mean cheaper tours, citing higher demand not only from Hong Kong but also around the world, especially North America, with a record three million foreign holidaymakers in Japan in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Huen also said Japanese people who opted to travel domestically instead of overseas added to demand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, he said Hongkongers find prices to be attractive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “A ramen index also suggested that a ramen in Japan now costs about HK$50, versus the about HK$120 to HK$150 in Central in Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There has been speculation that Tokyo has intervened to prop up the currency.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “An actual intervention would be authorities directly selling US dollars and buying the yen in the foreign exchange markets to support the yen, but the impact from such an intervention will be rather short-lived because the foreign exchange reserves that the Japanese government holds are limited,” Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank, said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It will not change the yen’s weakness in the long term, before the US Federal Reserve starts to cut interest rates later this year."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the yen to remain at about 150 to 160 against the greenback for some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This will give travellers from Hong Kong an advantage to visit Japan, but it will make the Hong Kong inbound tourism recovery even slower due to the linked exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar,” Cheung noted.

    'Labour Day tourist figures as expected'

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association, Timothy Chui, on Thursday said tourist figures for the first day of the mainland's Golden Week holiday were in line with expectations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said arrivals in the SAR exceeded 460,000 on May 1, including around 180,000 from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some tourists complained on social media platforms like Xiaohongshu that bad weather marred a fireworks show over Victoria Harbour on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui told an RTHK programme that he thinks the visitor numbers would have been even higher if the weather had been better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Indeed, some people joked that they didn't just see the fireworks but smoke as well. I believe this is to do with the weather. But I think visitors who came to Hong Kong were generally satisfied. It's very common to say a few words on social media platforms," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing his views, wholesale and retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said items such as jewellery and cosmetics were popular among tourists on May 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiu added that he hopes the government will continue to improve publicity for mega events and support airlines to beef up their flight capacity.

    New flu trend detection model for better vaccines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="CUHK Faculty of Medicine's research team developed a computational model to forest viral genetic evolution. Photo: CUHK Faculty of Medicine" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751406_1_L_20240502004550.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A Chinese University researcher said a new computing model could help the authorities make better choices in selecting the strain of flu they vaccinate people against.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Health officials have to choose which vaccine to order ahead of each flu season.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Maggie Wang, who developed the new model, known as beth-1, with colleagues from the Faculty of Medicine, said it could predict how the virus would change in the future.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the model would give authorities early warnings of emerging virus variants, particularly for the H3N2 virus, the H1N1 virus and the influenza B virus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This information is particularly important for the WHO (World Health Organisation) because each year or each season, the next season's influenza vaccine strain should be determined earlier, that is almost nine to 12 months ahead of the target season. A prediction model can provide critical information to inform the decision makers of the optimal vaccine strain to select," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For pharmaceutical companies, the forecasting model is also very useful because the manufacturing of the influenza vaccine has a really compact timeline. So earlier prediction can give more time and the buffer for the manufacturers to prepare the vaccine development and manufacturing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang added that their research team has already been working closely with institutions in the mainland to conduct animal experiments for manufacturing more effective vaccines using the beth-1 model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We did the prospective validation using mice model. That is, we predict the next season, the future season's representative viral strain, and then use this strain to make the vaccine to immunize the mice, and we also immunize another group of mice using the current vaccines," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And after a few months, when the target season comes, we collect the circulating viruses from the Prince of Wales Hospital, and then use this circulating virus to challenge the immunized mice, and compare how strongly antibody response in these two groups of mice. The outcome is that our model-predicted strain generates significantly higher, or non-inferior neutralization titer, antibody response against the circulating viruses."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Deputy Chief Secretary Warner Cheuk on Wednesday said a trial has shown that there are still many problems with the government's long-delayed waste charging programme.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The pay-as-you-throw scheme was tested at 14 locations from last month, covering homes, shops and restaurants, but only about half of the households participated by using designated bags to dispose of trash.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheuk said a working group had been meeting every week to discuss the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial observations, there are many problems. We think that if we introduce the waste charging scheme, we must have a consensus and support from Hong Kong people," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "That's because this policy directly affects the seven million people in Hong Kong. There must be favourable conditions in various areas in order to roll the scheme out smoothly."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officials had earlier said it remained to be seen whether a full rollout would go ahead on August 1 as planned.

    Labour Day fireworks to go ahead as planned

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Wednesday said an 8pm pyrotechnic display over Victoria Harbour will go ahead as planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The show had been in doubt because of inclement weather, but the board says forecasts show it's fine to go ahead, warning people attending to bring rain gear and check the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's good news for tourists in town for the Labour Day holiday who had been anxiously checking the weather ahead of the fireworks show, which is the first in a series planned to mark holidays and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A tourist, who is making a three-day trip from Zhejiang province, said it is her first time in Hong Kong and she really wants to see the fireworks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I really want to see it...I think the scene will be fascinating. I've watched similar shows on the mainland, but I think that may be different in Hong Kong," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And some mainland tourists said they would not be staying overnight because of the high prices for hotels during the holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will go back to Shenzhen at night, but we may come again on Friday. The price of a hotel room in Shenzhen is just a third of that in Hong Kong. That's a huge difference," a tourist said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Immigration Department said as of 4pm, there were about 237,000 tourist arrivals, and that includes nearly 140,000 mainland tourists.

    Hong Kong Observatory verifying reports of hail

Image: Facebook" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751351_1_L_20240501125814.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Observatory is verifying social media posts which apparently showed hail falling in Hong Kong as the city was hit with storms overnight.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During an amber warning issued at about 9.30pm on Tuesday, posts from several social media platforms reported that hail was falling in Yuen Long. One video on Instagram showed residents there running for cover.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said it is verifying the social media posts, and noted that there were reports of hail fall from Macau and Zhuhai.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Last year, there were also hail reports in March and April,” Betty Mak, a scientific officer at the Observatory, told RTHK, noting that there is nothing unusual for it to hail this time of year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’ll consider all the data and observations including the stability of the atmosphere and analysis of radar images and hail reports from nearby areas or locally to assess."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Members of the public should consider bringing rain gear when going out,” Mak added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster also said lightning struck the east of the territory more than 6,400 times between 10pm and 10am. “Violent gusts” of over 100km per hour were also recorded in Cheung Chau early on Wednesday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a concert that was being held in Central was forced to stop midway when the amber signal came into effect on Tuesday night.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And several flights were affected by the weather, with some being delayed or rerouted to land in other airports in the Pearl River Delta area.

    'More weight on GDP growth needed for minimum wage'
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1751345-20240501.htm

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Wednesday said authorities should give more weight to the growth of the SAR's economy in a new formula for calculating the minimum wage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council on Tuesday approved recommendations to review the minimum wage every year instead of every two years, and under the new mechanism, the minimum wage would not be reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new formula will take into account the consumer price index and 20 percent of the difference between the previous year’s GDP figure and economic growth in the past decade, with a cap of one percentage point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU chairman Kingsley Wong welcomed the change, but he said the hourly minimum wage would only increase by about HK$1 every year under the new mechanism, which is not ideal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Grassroots workers should also be able to share the results of economic prosperity. It's too low to only include [20 percent of the GDP growth difference]. This is what the mechanism is short of," he told an RTHK radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that employers, employees, officials and scholars should review the mechanism, for example, in every five years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said calculations should include 30 percent of the GDP growth difference instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on the same programme, the president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, Simon Wong, said the catering sector will not see a huge increase in operating costs because of the new mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Under the labour shortage situation, the hourly wage for the catering sector is a lot higher than the minimum wage... For temporary positions, restaurants mostly have to pay workers at least HK$50 to HK$60 per hour, and some Chinese restaurants even pay their frontline staff HK$80 or more," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, labour secretary Chris Sun brushed aside concerns that the new mechanism would undermine Hong Kong's competitiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, he said the government has considered many factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope to ensure that the wage won't be too low, while minimising the loss of low-paid jobs. We also have to consider the competitiveness of the city at the same time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We can't see how the modified minimum wage mechanism would affect the competitiveness of Hong Kong and the business sector," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, meanwhile, said on social media that the changes could protect grassroots workers. He expressed the hope that officials could work with various sectors to build a "reasonable, fair and safe" environment for workers.

 The Hong Kong Observatory warned on Tuesday evening that hail could affect the SAR after it was reported in the Pearl River Delta.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hail was reported in Macau as authorities there called on residents to stay indoors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Hong Kong, the amber rainstorm warning was issued at 9:30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The forecaster called on people to be alert and seek safe shelter, as violent gusts reaching 110 kilometres per hour affect the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department called on employers to avoid assigning workers to carry out electrical work, and protect the safety of those engaged in such tasks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by the rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent electric shock as the air would be more humid," said a spokesperson from the department.

    Negative equity cases at their highest in two decades

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The number of negative equity cases reached a 20-year high in the first quarter, figures released by Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) showed.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the HKMA, there were 32,073 cases at the end of March, up 27 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and the most since the first quarter of 2004.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA noted that the loans had mainly been taken out by bank staff or linked to mortgage insurance, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Government figures out last week showed home prices rebounded in March, snapping a 10-month losing streak. That's after Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced the scrapping of all property-cooling measures in his budget speech on February 28.

    'New changes to minimum wage fair for businesses'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association says the new way of calculating the minimum wage is fair for businesses. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751243_1_L_20240430180505.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A lawmaker and a representative of small and medium-sized firms on Tuesday welcomed the new way of calculating Hong Kong's minimum wage, which now takes into account the city's economic development and consumer prices.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Danny Lau, the honorary chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association, said the shake-up is fair for business operators and workers, but it is unreasonable there is no chance of the minimum wage being reduced if times get tough for businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The only thing that we worry is you can only [increase it], you cannot decrease the minimum wage," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new changes, the minimum wage would not be reduced but frozen even if the formula produces a negative number.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if it would put pressure on bosses in small and medium-sized firms when the economy is not doing well, Priscilla Wong, who chairs the Minimum Wage Commission, said a balance needs to be struck.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “These are the people with the lowest ability to bargain, the least bargaining power. And as a society, we are hoping that their wages do not go through vertically down and go down to the point that we lose our wage floor,” she told a media briefing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Unionist lawmaker Lam Chun-sing welcomed the new mechanism, but he told RTHK the administration should give greater weight to GDP in the calculations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope the proportion that [accounts for] the growth in GDP can be more. This means if we have a large growth of the GDP and then we can have an increase in minimum wages level, that's very important because it allows our grassroots workers to share the fruit of economic development," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Liberal Party's catering sector lawmaker, Tommy Cheung, earlier said the minimum wage could hurt the SAR's competitiveness, calling on authorities to scrap it altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But labour minister Chris Sun dismissed the suggestion, saying the new changes ensure there is room for low-paid workers to maintain their purchasing power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design of the formula is to make sure that while we remain competitive, we have to also take care of the needs of those at the very low level. We're just talking about a small number of workers. And as a society, we should help them to make sure that at the very low level, we have enough room for them to be able to earn.”

    HK to adopt new way of calculating minimum wage

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a shake-up of the way Hong Kong's minimum wage is decided, with the wage floor to be reviewed every year in future instead of every two.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Calculations will include the SAR's economic growth rate in the previous year, as well as consumer prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There'll be no chance of the minimum wage being reduced regardless of what the figures suggest, with any negative calculation leading to a freeze instead.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said it is making the changes based on recommendations from the Minimum Wage Commission, which consulted labour and employer groups as well as academics on the matter last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The first minimum wage under the new mechanism will be set in two years' time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The recommendations of the [commission] have struck an appropriate balance between the objectives of forestalling excessively low wages and minimising the loss of low-paid jobs, while giving due regard to sustaining Hong Kong's economic growth and competitiveness," said Labour Secretary Chris Sun.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong's minimum wage is currently set at HK$40 per hour. The Minimum Wage Commission is to submit a report by the end of October on its recommendations for any change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials on Tuesday warned that an extended flu season would continue for some time, with more outbreaks and serious cases.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Centre for Health Protection urged the public to remain vigilant as Hong Kong has seen a rise in flu infections, with more than 500 adults suffering serious complications or dying since January. Most of them are over 65 or have chronic illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  There have been 22 severe flu cases among children, including three deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, from the Centre for Health Protection, said health authorities were closely monitoring the situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The predominant flu strain has shifted from H3 to H1, resulting in another wave of infections. We expect this wave to continue for a few weeks, but it's difficult to say exactly how long," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are closely monitoring other regions of the world, as Hong Kong residents travel a lot. Influenza B is still circulating in some parts outside Hong Kong, so we cannot rule out the possibility of a further change in the flu strain."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Health authorities urged the public to seek medical attention if they experience flu-like symptoms.

 Scores of movie lovers on Tuesday bade farewell to President Cinema in Causeway Bay, bringing the curtain down on almost six decades of showing films.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its operator, Newport Circuit, had announced last week that the theatre on Jaffe Road was closing after Tuesday, though it did not say why.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, Newport Circuit thanked customers for their support throughout the years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While some people were just there to snap pictures, others bought tickets for the final shows at the theatre that first opened in 1966.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, an actor, said it was a pity that a platform which showcased cinematic productions was disappearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I've been here one or two times many years ago," he said. "I don't care if it's old or if the seat is good or bad, I just want to [catch a film] for the last time in this cinema."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another movie-goer, Alice, said she was watching a film at the cinema for the first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This kind of old cinema is very rare. They disappear when the industry is on decline and not many people are buying tickets, so I think if I have the chance to sit down and watch a movie [here] once, I'd like to go," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A regular customer, meanwhile, said the cinema brought back a lot of memories for her, from the days when people could still buy grilled squid before going into the theatre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's nothing we can do. Now everyone watches movies at home," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, a Golden Harvest cinema in Kai Tak also closed down, following the end of its tenancy contract.

 Police on Tuesday said they have arrested and charged a man and were searching for another over a crane collapse that killed three workers at a construction site in 2022.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers announced the arrest of a 35-year-old former project manager with the main contractor involved in the building construction in Sau Mau Ping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has been charged with manslaughter and will appear in Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a warrant was issued for a 72-year-old structural engineer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Aggressive Construction Company, the contractor for the site on Anderson Road, confirmed earlier that a former employee had been arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The company added that it is being prosecuted over the crane collapse.

    'More support needed for carers in subdivided flats'

    <![CDATA[<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Scholars on Tuesday called on the government to offer more support for people who look after children or elderly relatives while living in subdivided housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a survey conducted by Lingnan University and Chinese University, 95 percent of the 315 caregivers surveyed, who live in subdivided homes, were found to be stressed out, while 20.5 percent of respondents exhibited signs of depression.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press conference, Ruby Lai from Lingnan University's Department of Sociology and Social Policy said caregivers had been struggling with stress from the unsuitable living conditions, expensive rents and excessive workloads.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What we see is that there are many spatial constraints at home, like there's no separations of kitchen and toilet, or there's no independent cooking place, so that they have to set up a makeshift cooking space for them to cook every time and then to pack up all the things to leave this space for their children to do homework," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai called on the government to ensure better quality of life for caregivers living in such conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also called on authorities to roll out cash subsidies to relieve the stress faced by caregivers in subdivided housing, and strengthen community support.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said there's plenty for tourists to do in Hong Kong during the Labour Day Golden Week holiday, even if Wednesday night's pyrotechnic display might be cancelled due to weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Authorities had warned that the 10-minute show at Victoria Harbour on May 1 could be called off if rain and thunderstorms happen as predicted. A decision would be made on Wednesday afternoon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The display is scheduled to be the first in a series of occasions marking the city’s mega events and festivals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said weather would not affect other events during the national holiday this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We want to do the best to ensure that [the show] will be most welcome and enjoyed by everybody, tourists and Hong Kong people. But of course, the weather is always unpredictable," he said ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are a wide range of activities that have been arranged to welcome visitors during Golden Week."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said people are getting to grips with a ban on single-use plastic utensils, a week after it took effect.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Exco meeting, he said there are signs of people steadily changing their habits, citing a media report that said two-thirds of people are no longer taking plastic utensils in restaurants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On complaints from some people that alternative cutlery products are of low quality, Lee said he thinks suppliers and restaurants will get better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Of course during the process there's always room for us to make improvements. For restaurant operators and alternative [utensil] suppliers, I believe [they] will continue to improve their work and they will continue to supply different types of alternatives to disposable tableware," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that Secretary for Environment and Ecology Tse Chin-wan will continue to explain the new policy, after questions arose as to whether plastic containers can be used for takeaway food.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said authorities will keep an eye on the way people adapt to the initial phase of the ban, as well as the supply of substitute products, before deciding what to do next.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While restaurants are now banned from giving out plastic utensils like straws and cutlery, the government had earlier said that plastic containers and cups – which are still allowed for takeaways at the moment – will be banned completely in the next phase.

    Loss of immunity extending flu season, HKU medic says

<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Tuesday that Hong Kong's flu season is running longer than normal this year, with cases still increasing rather than tapering off as expected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine told RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  </a>
  programme that the extended flu season reflected a global phenomenon, with people's immunity against viruses falling when measures were imposed during the Covid pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He says Hong Kong now faces what he called a tridemic, with people threatened by flu, Covid and another respiratory infection, RSV respiratory syncytial virus, as well as other conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked when the flu season would conclude, he told RTHK's Janice Wong: "We cannot make a prediction yet because the number is still rising and we are still seeing so many of the severe cases. Unfortunately, we hear about the news of another fatal case yesterday. This is very sad.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I cannot make a prediction at this moment, but I just hope that the citizens can just go and have the flu vaccine if they have not yet received the vaccine."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kwan said acceptance of the flu vaccine remained relatively low in Hong Kong. He also suggested people wear masks in crowded areas, use proper hygiene and stay home if they have the flu.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of an NGO said on Tuesday that many Hong Kong social workers are experiencing burnout as they face a range of challenges, including an increasing workload as more people in society face difficulty with their mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=949557&livetime=20240430000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  programme,  Chou Wah-shan from the mental health group Dreams Possible said a survey conducted with University of Hong Kong academics found that 93 percent of the 255 social workers interviewed experienced a moderate level of work-related stress.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the study also found signs of depression in 68 percent of the interviewees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The issue of burning out is becoming more and more alarming," he told RTHK's Samantha Butler. "Because I think in the past couple of years, Hong Kong has been facing huge challlenges in many aspects: socio-economic, political.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Also, many people are feeling frustrated and are having emotional and mental illness issues. That's why the workload of social workers, as the helping profession, has immensely increased, together with the intensity of clients' emotional issues, including emotional issues, depression, anxiety disorder or even suicidal issues."

    Inquest experts differ over patient's liver failure

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Professor Henry Pleass says Tang Kwai-sze’s acute liver failure was absolutely because of a hepatitis B flare-up. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751062_1_L_20240429173646.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A transplant surgeon has stressed that a second organ transplant for a liver disease patient was the only way to keep her alive, as the Coroner’s Court heard conflicting explanations as to why the patient developed acute hepatic failure before her death.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tang Kwai-sze, a hepatitis B carrier, underwent two liver transplants at Queen Mary Hospital in April 2017 and died in August that same year at the age of 44.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two doctors who treated Tang at United Christian Hospital, Lam Chi-kwan and Chan Siu-kim, were later found guilty of professional misconduct for failing to prescribe an antiviral drug she needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Henry Pleass, a transplant surgeon in Australia, said it was unfortunate that medical practitioners did not give Tang medication needed along with the steroids she was taking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It’s our modern system with many other doctors looking after one individual. There’s no continuation,” he told the inquest's five-person jury and coroner Monica Chow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We made the assumption that people have thought about the issue, and thought about the risks.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang had experienced medical issues after the first transplant and Pleass said while doctors could have treated her conservatively, the surgery for a new organ gave her a chance of survival.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the cause of Tang’s liver failure, Pleass said it was “absolutely” because of a hepatitis B flare-up, ruling out the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis as suggested by another expert witness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, histopathologist Wilson Tsui said it was more likely that Tang suffered from autoimmune hepatitis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the high count of plasma cells and the absence of serologic markers, which are used to identify antibodies formed following an infection, indicated that a hepatitis B flare-up was less likely to have been the case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “To differentiate between a reactivation of hepatitis B and autoimmune hepatitis, [the count of plasma cells] is a relatively important index,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But James Fung, an expert witness called to give evidence again after Tsui’s testimony, said the majority of patients with an acute hepatitis flare-up would still test negative for such serological markers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fung, a transplant hepatologist at Queen Mary Hospital, also noted that while a higher count of plasma cells is commonly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, there could be exceptions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Especially with very severe acute flares of hepatitis B, [plasma] cells themselves are often seen in these severe cases,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hearing continues.

    Govt to adopt new heatstroke rules for outdoor workers

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Labour Department says its updated guidelines on when outdoor workers should take a break under hot weather conditions will take effect next month. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1751046_1_L_20240429163232.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour officials on Monday said they were updating guidelines on when outdoor workers would be advised to stop working when it's very hot.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would enable the department’s heat stress warning system to be in line with the observatory's warnings about hot weather.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The observatory’s "extremely hot special alert" is issued when it's generally 35 degree Celcius and above.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some environmental and workers' groups had called for such a linkage between the two alert systems last year when the department’s guidelines were introduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Labour Department said the updated guidelines would apply next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The guidelines also set out the varying lengths of breaks workers should be given every hour when the heat stress warnings are in effect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The new rules state that if employers adopt a certain amount of measures to prevent heatstroke - such as reducing workload, providing shades and using mist fans to improve ventilation - they can completely cut the hourly breaks for workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If insufficient measures were adopted, the guidelines said, employers would be required to give longer breaks to workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Employers would be given flexibility to alternate break times for different workers, and they can split break periods into shorter ones so as to minimise the effects on work progress.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Undersecretary for Labour and Welfare, Ho Kai-ming, on Monday said jail terms for professionals who fail to report suspected child abuse cases should be kept in the draft legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to the Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill, which is currently making its way through the Legislative Council, the maximum penalty for not reporting suspected severe child abuse cases would be a three-month jail term and a fine of HK$50,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Several lawmakers have suggested removing the prison term, saying it is too harsh.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a Legco's bills committee, Ho reassured lawmakers that professionals, who work with children, would only face prison if they fail to report extremely severe cases.
  <br/>

  "Professionals will only face imprisonment in extremely severe cases. This means that professionals, who genuinely suspect that a child has suffered significant harm - or is facing actual risks - yet fail to report it without meeting any exemptions for reporting or providing any reasonable justifications, only then will prosecution be initiated," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho warned that scrapping a prison sentence from the bill would lower the effectiveness of the legislation, and society would have to bear the consequences.

 Chief Secretary Eric Chan said on Monday that a "soft sell" approach will be adopted when it comes to promoting patriotism in Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chan, who chairs the new Working Group on Patriotic Education, said the group is aimed at integrating patriotism into core values of the community, but this will not involve "hard sell" tactics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Patriotism is not something that can be learnt by repeating from memory. Getting to understand is the first step. The ultimate goal is to achieve emotional identification. Sincerely identify with the country, feel proud of the country and then consciously love and protect the country," Chan told reporters after an inaugural meeting of the working group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said the group will make reference to the mainland's patriotic education law and come up with appropriate and suitable proposals for the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he said the government has no plans to legislate patriotism and will rely on policies and activities to promote it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the government will organise various activities and celebrations in the run-up to October's 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, to enable young people to learn more about their country.

    Art 23 places no limits on press freedom: Paul Lam

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Monday said national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law places no "extra and unreasonable" restrictions on press freedom and the media can still sharply criticise the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an op-ed published in Ming Pao Daily, the minister said there was no move to introduce restrictions on the press through the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the administration wants the media to pass on accurate, fair and positive information so that officials can lead society to make changes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, [officials] need to comprehensively know the ideas, needs and demands from the public [through the press]," Lam wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said so long as the media continue to be impartial, objective and fair in adhering to fundamental professional codes in seeking the truth, there is no need for journalists to be particularly concerned about violating the security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the piece titled "Change and no change", Lam said while the enactment of the homegrown security law last month marked a major change, there are also things that have remained constant such as the values of common law and the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the one hand it improved the legislation on safeguarding national security. It also fully respects fundamental human rights and freedoms on the other," he wrote.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Lawmakers and families of pupils at Rosaryhill Secondary School say students are left on their own after the school decides to cease operations early. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1750934_1_L_20240428184716.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers and families of pupils at an aided Catholic school in Wan Chai on Sunday accused education officials of inaction over the institution's decision to shut earlier than it had originally planned.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Rosaryhill Secondary School on Stubbs Road first announced last September that it would cease operations after the 2025-26 academic year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government-aided school later said it would arrange for Form One to Five pupils to transfer to Yu Chun Keung Memorial College No 2 this September. Rosaryhill Kindergarten and Rosaryhill (Primary) School, meanwhile, will be combined with Dalton School Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The brother of a Form Five pupil – a former Rosaryhill student himself – expressed concerns about his sister's education at her new school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”The Education Bureau was relatively passive and not willing to help us on this issue... Pupils are not as simple as assets that you could transfer to others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother of a Form Three student condemned the Education Bureau for not having met parents over the issue, which she said weighed heavily on her son.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Election Committee legislator Doreen Kong urged the administration to address the issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We don't want this to happen again. The [Education Bureau] must explain to the public what the principles are and what the policies of the government are in handling all these similar situations,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They have to come out to help the students and to ensure that there is a smooth transition for all the students, especially to overcome their psychological distress."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Third Side lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen, for his part, said he would file a complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I find that the school is not professional enough to take care of the students. And the administrative side is also not totally concerned about the rights and interests of students and parents... I want to clarify, during the process, what role did the administration play," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tik said he would also talk to authorities on pushing back the school’s shutdown, to let senior secondary pupils finish their studies there.

 Police on Sunday arrested a mother on suspicion of leaving her three children at home alone in Tung Chung.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they received a call from her son, 9, shortly after 10am, saying his mother "went downstairs" from the flat at Yat Tung Estate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said when they arrived at the scene, they found his brother, 2, and sister, 6, were also there.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The children were not hurt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police arrested the woman, 36, on suspicion of child neglect.
