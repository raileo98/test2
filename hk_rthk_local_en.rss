<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has accused a charity that runs a college helping young people quit drugs of harbouring former directors on the police's wanted list.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In January, the authorities arrested four directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others who were not in Hong Kong were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday said narcotics officials have met the association's directors, but the board members' words do not match their actions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities questioned the directors' claim that they have cut ties with former college head Alman Chan and founder Jacob Lam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, the two on the wanted list [Chan and Lam] are still directors of Christian Zheng Sheng Association Ltd and/or Zheng Sheng Charity Fund Limited under the association, and they can even operate the bank accounts under the association and its subsidiary companies," the government said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesman said the board passed a motion not to recover millions of dollars the college had raised, which the two had allegedly transferred overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said this is suspicious, and also shows that the board had no intention of helping students at the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government said law enforcement officers will investigate the matter.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Four varieties of watermelon will be featured at the upcoming Local Organic Watermelon Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The annual event, organised by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, kicks off on Friday at the Maritime Square Farmers Market in Tsing Yi, where people can buy local produce and interact with farmers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The four varieties featured this year include Super Sweet Black Angel 168, Diana, Huang Yu and seedless 3F-2728.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Mun-wai, an agricultural officer, said people could also purchase local produce through the Local Fresh website and app or through local farmers directly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added the festival aimed to promote local agriculture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The festival is to promote the local organic produce, to strengthen the sustainability of local agriculture, and to build a platform for the farmers to connect with the public and share their harvest with the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mrs Liang, a farmer, started growing watermelons last year and used a shed this year to minimise the weather's effects on crops, leading to a better harvest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that watermelons which were locally produced were fresher compared with imported watermelons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the morning we harvest the watermelons and in the afternoon they will be sold at the festival, so I hope everyone can support us farmers," she said.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757924_1_20240618122041.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong climbed two places to fifth in an annual global ranking of the world's most competitive economies, with an improved economic performance helping the SAR move up the table.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2024 was unveiled by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development on Tuesday, after researchers assessed data from 67 countries and regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The list ranked economies based on four main factors: economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong returns to fifth place mainly because of improvements in economic performance, business efficiency, and infrastructure. In government efficiency, it slightly drops from second to third," the report said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report attributed Hong Kong's rise in economic performance, from 36th to 11th spot, to "steep increases" in the domestic economy and employment sub-factors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The city topped the rankings in the international trade and business legislation sub-categories, while placing within the top five in five other areas - international investment, tax policy, finance, basic infrastructure and education.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Hong Kong government spokesperson said the city's economy continued to recover after the pandemic, thanks to the "staunch support" from the central authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman also noted the administration had introduced measures to boost market confidence and organised mega events to encourage tourism and spending, while working to attract overseas enterprises and talent to come to the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a social media post, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said the latest rankings were "a recognition of the brilliant achievements" of the SAR government, alongside local and foreign talent and enterprises, in the city's development and economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said high-quality talent and strategic companies from all over world had "voted with their feet" by coming to Hong Kong to seek opportunities, adding that officials had received more than 300,000 applications to various talent schemes by the end of May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 120,000 people had arrived in Hong Kong, far beyond the initial target of attracting 35,000 per year, Chan added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Singapore returned to the top spot for the first time since 2020, followed by Switzerland and Denmark, which placed first in the previous year's rankings. Mainland China climbed seven spots to place 14th.

    Principal of closing school welcomes govt intervention

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The principal of a Wong Tai Sin school which is set to close in two years says she welcomes the Education Bureau’s decision to step in, adding that she hopes the bureau will clarify what a "management failure" means.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On Monday evening, the bureau announced it will appoint managers to Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, citing a "management failure" at the institution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's sponsoring body – the Confucian Academy – said over the weekend that the school will cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school's principal, Yuen Poon Suk-han, told reporters on Tuesday that the academy is to blame for not consulting everyone involved regarding the decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The problem now is the Confucian Academy fails to conduct extensive consultations with various stakeholders on the plan. So I hope the Education Bureau will clarify what management failure means, to prevent some people from making a big fuss and misleading the public," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some parents told RTHK they are disappointed by the closure and hope the government can provide help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My kids study in an English class. You know there are not many English primary schools available. The ones I can find are mostly Chinese primary schools. I asked my kids whether it's possible to switch back to a Chinese primary school and they said they are worried they can't handle it," said one parent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A primary five pupil said he hopes the closure can be delayed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm a bit unhappy. I wish the school could wait a few more years, maybe five, before closing down... I think the school offers a learning environment that other schools can't provide, because there are many recreational facilities," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Investors will still be able to trade in the city's financial market under typhoon signal number eight or above and during black rainstorm warnings from September 23.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee made the announcement ahead of his weekly Executive Council meeting, saying Hong Kong has no valid reason to stop the financial market operating during severe weather conditions, when other major financial hubs are able to continue trading in such circumstances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Other securities markets around the world such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, they maintain trading even under severe weather conditions. Hong Kong is the only exception. Hong Kong is an international financial centre and there is no reason for us not to align with international standards," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said the move would consolidate the competitiveness of HKEx and raise Hong Kong's role as a trading corridor with the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing a public consultation exercise carried out by HKEx, Lee said about 90 percent of brokerages and banks support keeping the financial market open under severe weather conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the implementation date in late September will give the trade enough time to prepare, and the relevant authorities will offer support to small brokerages to cope with the change.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee says airport officials followed their contingency procedures to handle an emergency that closed a runway for hours on Monday, with a plane operator asked to submit a report to the authorities.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hundreds of flights were delayed after a cargo plane experienced a flat tyre during an emergency landing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive on Tuesday said the authorities kept the public informed, made alternative transport and flight arrangements, and brought in extra manpower.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said the plane's operator has been told to submit a report on the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am a believer that, for any matter, there's always room for improvement. I'm glad that the incident was handled safely. That is the most important principle in any emergency incident, that's the number one priority," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will scrutinise reports and see whether any extra action can be taken by the airline, by the [Airport Authority] and other parties concerned."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that similar incidents could be dealt with more efficiently in the future when the airport's third runway is fully in operation at the end of this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Monday said it will appoint managers to the Confucian Tai Shing Primary School, which is set to close in two years, citing ineffective management at the institution.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The sponsoring body of the Wong Tai Sin school – the Confucian Academy – announced over the weekend that the school would cease operations from the 2026-27 academic year and stop accepting primary one pupils from 2025-26.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a press conference on Monday, the school's principal Yuen Poon Suk-han said she and the management committee were not consulted on the academy's decision to suspend the school beforehand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the academy said the school's chancellor had informed its managers and principal in April, and that the decision was "carefully considered".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to media enquiries, the bureau said it had met with the school's principal and sponsoring body multiple times and that the two parties had failed to reach a consensus on a transition plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it will appoint managers to the school to ensure that it is managed properly and that the closure aligns with existing mechanisms and procedures.

    Govt announces strategy on hydrogen development

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Monday announced its strategy on hydrogen development, saying it is to address climate change and help achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a ceremony, officials said 14 trial projects are in the pipeline, such as using hydrogen to power street-cleaning vehicles and to generate electricity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment Secretary Tse Chin-wan said the strategy is an important milestone that will help build a carbon-free city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “When we are pursuing carbon neutrality, it is necessary for us to acquire what we call the zero-carbon energy in order to support the green transition. Hydrogen is one of the zero-carbon energies,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We believe that hydrogen has a great potential to develop a new green economy in Hong Kong, because its production, its storage and also its application in different sectors will enhance the employment of labour and the setting up of new industry,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that changes to the law will be proposed in the first half of next year to ensure safe storage and supply of the highly combustible gas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR already has a hydrogen double-decker bus and the MTR will trial a hydrogen-powered light rail vehicle later this year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority on Monday afternoon said that the north runway at Chek Lap Kok was up and running again after a cargo plane, that had burst a tyre, was towed away at around 3 pm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The jet made an emergency landing at around 7:30 am, forcing the closure of the runway for almost eight hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only one runway remained in operation, and around 450 flights were delayed as a result.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Passengers said their itineraries were badly affected, with some complaining that they had missed their onward connections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said even though both runways had since resumed operation, some flights could still be disrupted as a backlog was being cleared.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It urged passengers to keep tabs on the latest flight information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Late on Monday evening the Airport Authority said the Airport Express Link would run more frequently after midnight, with the last train to Hong Kong Station departing at 1:30 am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said the airport's Automated People Mover System and customer service counters would stay open until 3 am.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Tourism Board on Monday said tourists made nearly 3.4 million trips to Hong Kong in May, a 20 percent increase from a year ago.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It said initial figures show that some 2.6 million trips were made by mainlanders, which was a 15 percent rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trips by travellers from outside the mainland jumped by some 43 percent, to more than 771,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Cumulatively, a total of 18 million visitors arrived in Hong Kong from January to May this year, increasing by 80 percent from the same period last year," the board said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The border between Hong Kong and the mainland fully reopened in early February last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the DAB said Hong Kong can consider making use of its culture of martial arts novels and TV series to attract tourists, together with fellow Greater Bay Area cities like Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Party vice-chairman Holden Chow told reporters the SAR can think about hosting activities around "intangible assets", like novels written by the late Jin Yong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said they are still very attractive to many people around the world, including those from South East Asia.

    No civil servant tests on security laws: govt

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Ingrid Yeung told lawmakers there will be national security training, but not examinations, for new and existing government workers." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757780_1_20240617140633.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil Service Secretary Ingrid Yeung on Monday said there are no plans to test government workers on how familiar they are with national security legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of tests was brought up by lawmakers at a Legco panel meeting to discuss the updated Civil Service Code, which sets resolutely safeguarding national security as a core value of government staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said there will be plenty of national security training for new and existing government workers, but not examinations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Training is about integrity and attitude. You can't really test that in an examination," she told lawmakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Yes, you can ask them to quote many examples, but can they actually deliver? That's more important. That's why we will assess their day-to-day performance and their conduct as we appraise colleagues."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The updated code also states that in their official capacity, civil servants cannot criticise any government policies or support opposing views, and they must be loyal to the chief executive of the day and the Central People's Government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau Siu-chung, from the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, asked for clarity on this, saying it's hard to know when someone is speaking whether it's in their official or personal capacity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He argued that if government workers are not allowed to make public criticism in a personal capacity, it may not be good for overall governance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said this is something for civil servants to work out for themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister also stressed that if a policy is in the consultation stage, government workers can speak more freely, but once a decision is made they should be extra careful.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the same meeting, lawmakers also discussed a planned across-the-board three percent pay rise for civil servants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung dismissed a claim from the federation's Lam Chun-sing that the government has been under pressure from employers to keep rises in check, so that private sector staff don't demand bigger increases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister reiterated that the latest pay decision was made based on several factors, including the government's budget deficit.

    Consumer watchdog warns of hidden fees at pet hotels

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Pet owners should study the fine print carefully when choosing a lodging for their furry friends and avoid those which are unlicensed, according to the Consumer Council.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The council randomly selected 18 licensed pet hotels across Hong Kong for study earlier this year. Only five had their fee structures published online, meaning consumers had to make enquiries, a process which could be tedious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different operators also had varying charging schemes. Some charged up to double the normal rate during peak periods such as the Lunar New Year holiday, while the administering of medicines or nutritional supplements all came at a cost.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the event of injury, illness or even death, only four hotels would provide compensation of between HK$300 and HK$5,000. Eight others stated they would assume no legal liability through disclaimers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apart form urging pet hotel operators to be more transparent in their fee structures, the watchdog also hoped the government could amend the rules so that all licensed animal boarding providers were published on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department's website.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the council conducted a survey of private camping sites in Hong Kong and found that nearly 40 percent of them were suspected of operating illegally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only three of the 22 venues covered in the study carried a proper licence or compliance certificate to operate a holiday camp. Authorities were verifying if any operator had breached rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also studied another seven "glamping" sites which provide extra amenities. Only three were covered by third-party liability insurance, meaning people staying at other sites may not have adequate protection in case of emergencies or accidents.

    Government plans to raise university tuition fees

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Government plans to raise university tuition fees" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757765_1_20240617124143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Monday said the government plans to raise university tuition fees in the next few years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Local undergraduate students at University Grants Committee-funded institutions pay an annual tuition fee of HK$42,100 – an amount that has remained unchanged since 1996.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK marking the second anniversary of the current term of government, Choi said a fee increase for such students will be implemented in stages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After all these years... there's been 40 percent inflation, but we haven't raised tuition fees at all. So we think it's time for a review and to maintain fiscal discipline," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the government will make an announcement in advance so that universities can introduce more grants and bursaries for students in need.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the minister said she expects more institutions to offer applied degree programmes that combine theory and practical skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee proposed in his policy address last year to develop Hong Kong into an international hub for post-secondary education and to facilitate the establishment of universities of applied sciences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that each university has its own strengths, so there should be a division of labour regarding the courses they offer in the future.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of rush-hour commuters had to be evacuated from an MTR train on Monday morning, after a 40-centimetre snake was seen slithering through one of the carriages.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Police said they were notified at around 7:30am that a black and white snake was spotted on a Tsuen Wan Line train that was approaching Admiralty station from Central.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All passengers were asked to disembark at Admiralty, and no one was injured in the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A snake catcher was called in soon after, and the serpent – believed to be a nonvenomous California Kingsnake – was captured and sent to Kadoorie Farm.

    Better labelling for air purifiers needed: watchdog

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Monday called on manufacturers of air purifiers to clearly indicate how much clean air their products can deliver per minute.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said clearly stating the clean air delivery rate would help buyers make better choices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council tested 10 air purifiers, and found big differences in their performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The best performing model was 12.3 times better than the worst at removing formaldehyde, while variations in their effectiveness in removing smoke ranged up to 2.7 times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, the council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said the clean air delivery rate could act as a convenient metric for consumers to compare different air purifier models.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Because the standards of filtration is quite different among different countries, no matter it is dust or pollens or cigarette smoke, it's quite diverse,” she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It is easier for consumers to compare based on the CADR - the clean air delivery rate.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Health reminded consumers to clean their purifiers regularly to minimise the risk of diseases, while the Hong Kong Medical Association reminded people to maintain air circulation by keeping windows open to ensure indoor air quality.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Airport Authority said on Monday morning there could be disruptions to flights in and out of Hong Kong for a few hours due to the closure of the north runway.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The closure followed an emergency landing by a cargo plane at around 7:30am, during which the jet experienced a flat tyre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority said only one runway remained in operation for the time being, and flights schedules may be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It called on passengers to watch out for the latest flight information.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hundreds of thousands of erectile dysfunction pills, anti-depressants and other psychotropic drugs have been seized in Hong Kong this month with four people arrested on suspicion of running a medication mail service without a permit, customs officers said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 1.4 million pills, found in a remote village house in Mui Wo and at a subdivided factory unit in San Po Kong, are believed to be worth around HK$80 million in total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said the hauls mostly comprised of generic drugs from India.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's believed the pills were being posted to dozens of places around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A senior customs investigator, Hong Yan, said they were looking into whether the two cases are linked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We found that the two syndicates operate in a very similar fashion. They both rented a unit as a centre for packaging and storing the medicines," he told a press conference.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They also hired foreigners to package and post the medicines overseas. Furthermore, inside the units, the ways the drugs were categorised and stored were very similar."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said two women arrested in Mui Wo at the start of the month had since been released on bail, while two women arrested in San Po Kong were still in detention.

 Fifteen men and five women have been arrested on suspicion of loan sharking and illegal debt collection, police said on Sunday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force said that during an operation, officers seized HK$300,000 in cash, bank cards, phones, computers and debt collection notes, as well as cars and watches suspected to be the proceeds of crime.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said more than a million dollars was loaned to nine people in Sau Mau Ping in recent months, and a group threatened and harassed those who failed to repay the money on time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Our intelligence indicated that the syndicate used various illegal debt collecting methods, including splashing red paint to debtors’ flats, damaging the door locks and criminal intimidation to force the debtors to repay their loans,” said Inspector Leung Ho-ching.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police added that they have identified a bank account linked to the case that was allegedly used to launder at least HK$5.8 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An NGO on Sunday said a survey it has carried out suggests the majority of people living in poor housing support the government's goal of ridding the city of low-quality subdivided units, but they're also concerned about where they would move to if it happens.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Caritas Community Development Service said it spoke to 231 tenants of subdivided flats and cubic apartments from December to April, and found that 70 percent think the government should regulate low-quality subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But 60 percent said they worry they wouldn't be able to find an affordable home if such a move was taken.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They think that if the government takes the action to regulate subdivided housing, it means that there would be fewer subdivided flats in the urban areas. So they may need to afford a higher rent, and they may not find suitable units," said Kelvin Lee, a social worker with the NGO.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government's Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units has been asked to come up with proposals on minimum living standards for such homes, as well as how those that are substandard can be eradicated altogether.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last week, officials announced that applications for Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing will open from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said single non-elderly people are less likely to secure a place under a points system that prioritises families living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The social worker added that building more public housing is the long-term solution to the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government needs to consider using the vacant land reserve to build more public housing, especially in the urban areas, since most of the low-income talents are living in those urban areas, which is near their jobs and schools for the children," Lee said.

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757649_1_20240616122050.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) on Sunday said more than half of shop operators it spoke to in Kowloon City want to move back to the neighbourhood after a makeover designed to beautify the area and preserve its culture.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The ongoing project, covering three sections of Carpenter Road and Nga Tsin Wai Road, will see the Kowloon City wet market relocated and some of its surrounding areas demolished to make way for more than 4,000 new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority's managing director, Wai Chi-sing, wrote on his blog that the URA held 15 meetings with wet market food vendors and Thai restaurant operators to brief them on relocation and transitional arrangements.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They shared with the team that they have been doing business in the 'Dragon City' district for many years and are attached to the district, hoping to pass on the friendship," he wrote.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some operators also hope to pass on the regional characteristics to the next generation through the relocation arrangement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wai said the authority will reserve some shops for these vendors after the area is rebuilt and offer concessionary rent for them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The URA earlier said it hopes the new Kowloon City Market can be completed by 2030 while most of the other proposed facilities can be ready by 2037.

    Officials greet first overnight high-speed trains

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first overnight high-speed trains from Beijing and Shanghai to Hong Kong arrived on Sunday morning, with tourism minister Kevin Yeung saying passengers were generally positive about the “sleep and arrive” arrangement.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Yeung and MTR CEO Jacob Kam welcomed passengers at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station and handed out souvenirs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The tourism chief said passengers told him they thought it was good to be able to sleep on the train and arrive refreshed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe it provides an extra option. In the past, most travellers from Shanghai and Beijing would choose to take a plane. Even if they took high-speed trains, that would be during daytime,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Now that the option of taking an overnight train is available, passengers can make better use of their time. They can sleep on the train and when they arrive in Hong Kong in the morning they can do the things they want. They have a whole day to travel.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A passenger from Shanghai, who brought his son along to experience a sleeper train for the first time, said he was satisfied with the facilities, but his son had trouble sleeping.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The noise level is a bit high. Otherwise it's quite good. There's no problem for an individual to fall asleep. During the trip the train passed through some tunnels that generated a big noise," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kam said while demand for the first few trains was really positive, it is still too early to discuss the possibility of increasing the frequency of services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We need to consider the passenger needs and the needs for various destinations. Also we need to consider that the sleeper trains pass through various railway tracks and they require maintenance. We need to strive a balance between maintenance work and the passenger need,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the first Beijing-bound sleeper train from Hong Kong arrived in the capital on Sunday morning. Secretary for Transport Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, said he really enjoyed his meal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I had grilled beef with king trumpet mushroom rice. The portion of the beef is quite large and there are many varieties of the side dishes. There are vegetables, meat and sauce, and the rice is also warm. Therefore I highly recommend it,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said he was not worried that the new services will encourage more tourists not to stay in a hotel when they visit the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four sleeper trains run every Friday to Monday night, with two travelling from Hong Kong to Shanghai and Beijing and two going in the opposite direction.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Top Hong Kong officials on Sunday celebrated Father's Day by sharing stories about them and their children, as they wished all dads a good day.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee posted a photo online of a card his son made him decades ago when he nominated him for a "top ten modern day father" award.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he felt warm and proud to see it again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's wife had written a message on the card saying "although he is very busy with work, he spends time every week chit-chatting with me. He also encouraged me to take part in more community work."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said it was unfortunate he couldn't attend the fathers' award ceremony at the time because of work, and nowadays he also loses time with his family because he is busy in the office.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee thanked his family for supporting him so he can focus on work and make good policies for the people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said he spent the weekend playing football with several fathers and their sons, saying many fathers are often too busy to play with their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan wrote on his weekly blog that the government has been putting a lot of resources into sports facilities in recent years, from five-a-side football pitches to the Kai Tak Sports Park, which will be the biggest ever sports infrastructure project in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the park is due to open in the middle of next year and said it should hopefully bring business opportunities as well as spectacular sport and other performances for locals and tourists alike.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is investigating a case of suspected mad honey poisoning, after a 35-year-old man became dizzy and started vomiting about half an hour after eating the honey on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The following day he went to the accident and emergency department at Kwong Wah Hospital and was admitted with low blood pressure and a slow heart rate. He is in stable condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mad honey poisoning is caused by ingestion of honey containing grayanotoxins derived from plants belonging to the Ericaceae family - including rhododendrons, a CHP spokesman said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initial enquiries show the patient had consumed honey mailed to Hong Kong by a friend from Nepal. Investigations are ongoing.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The first high-speed sleeper train from Hong Kong to Beijing departed on Saturday evening, with the transport minister calling the new overnight services a "breakthrough".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung, who was onboard, also said the administration would look to see whether it was possible to increase the number of sleeper trains.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Now we get four days of sleeper services. But it depends on how it goes. And I would say that if it is welcomed by the general public, we'll push for more," he told reporters prior to departure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The train for Beijing left at 6.24 pm on Saturday, and passengers will arrive at their destination about half a day later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm very happy and excited that I can take the first train to Beijing. I haven't been to Beijing for a long while. I'll be able to see the bustle and the prosperity of our nation's capital," a lady surnamed Chung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This train is really good. It is fast. I only need to sleep one night and then I will arrive when I wake up. It saves a lot of time."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China Travel Service was among the travel agencies allotted tickets for the trip. Its managing director, Chen Rui-dong, said all of its 35 tickets were quickly snapped up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Following the chief executive's announcement, the tickets were sold out in half a day. We hope that there will be more sleeper train services in future," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another sleeper train bound for Shanghai was set to depart from Hong Kong at 7.49 pm on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the new regular services, which will have trains running between Friday and Monday, trips from Hong Kong's West Kowloon terminus will take about 12.5 hours to get to Beijing, and around 11 hours to Shanghai.

    Heavy rain fails to dampen dragon boat race enthusiasm

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Thousands of spectators on Saturday flocked to the Tsim Sha Tsui East Promenade to watch the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in spite of the heavy rain.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 4,000 competitors, representing over 170 teams from 12 countries or regions, are taking part in the two-day sporting event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Singaporean rower said he was enjoying the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's a new experience for us because we don't normally race out in the sea. I think in Singapore, we normally train in the reservoir, so the water is much calmer. I think it's a totally new experience for us," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's very great, very lively. I think we do not have such big international competitions back in Singapore."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A mainland tourist, Mr Shao, said the showers hadn't dampened the atmosphere.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The weather is cool. It is nice to have the dragon boat races here, whether it be from the spectators' or rowers' point of view. Probably because the race venue is close to the city centre, there are many tourists here. I think everyone can feel that Hong Kong is promoting Chinese traditional culture," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The races were organised by the Tourism Board and the Hong Kong, China Dragon Boat Association.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A fireworks display over Victoria Harbour scheduled for 8 pm was cancelled in light of the three Amber Rainstorm Warning Signals issued by the Observatory on Saturday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Housing secretary Winnie Ho has played down suggestions that people who are single will be less likely to secure a Light Public Housing unit under a points system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Applications for the first batch of the modular temporary housing flats in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long begin on June 24. Only those who have been on the waiting list for public rental housing for at least three years can apply, and they will remain on the public housing list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the points system, families living in poor conditions, households with infants and the elderly, and people with disabilities would be given extra marks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme on Saturday, the minister said single-person households still have a chance for a light public housing unit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our entire social structure is centred on the family. Families take care of elderly people and children. They often have greater burdens and face situations which are more complex. So it's designed with families in mind," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Individuals, who are single, can still apply for light public housing because they can still qualify in certain circumstances."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the majority of flats designed for one or two people, Ho said the provision of different home sizes was based on an earlier study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Two people could already be considered to be a family. There are also households that have a single parent with a child. They are two people and that's a small family," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to results from a study on subdivided flats in 2021, around 70 percent are households with one or two people. Households of three, four or more accounted for 30 percent. So based on this ratio, and because our measure is aimed at taking care of people living in such conditions, the design is based on the actual situation."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With regard to the recent government clamp down on better-off people taking advantage of public housing, the minister said 14 tenants, who had failed to return a declaration form to authorities, would be told to vacate their units. They were among the first batch of 88,000 public housing tenants required to make declarations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And for a second group of 250,000 tenants told to make declarations, Ho said more than 90 percent had returned their forms, while officials had repossessed around 1,400 units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Ho said a task force on subdivided units would submit a report in August after collecting views on the matter. She said some had suggested such flats should be a minimum of seven to 10 square metres in size.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government remains committed to large-scale developments despite challenges brought about by the geopolitical and economic situation, a top adviser for Chief Executive John Lee has said.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Stephen Wong, who heads the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, also said the city's leader hoped the administration would work more closely with the market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We don't underestimate the challenges... but also, on balance, we are very optimistic and we obviously have faith in the future, which is why the government is committed to large-scale developments, for example, in San Tin, a science and tech city, and the Northern Metropolis," Wong told RTHK's Your Home Address programme on Saturday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These are big developments that are saying that we have faith in our future. We trust that the future will bring further development to Hong Kong. So I think as long as there's a capable government that works closely with society, with the efficient market, then we can bring opportunities to a very special place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In 2022, Wong was appointed the head of the policy unit, which serves as a think-tank for the Chief Executive in formulating policies by conducting research and gathering opinions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday expressed strong dissatisfaction and rejected criticism from the United States and  other Western countries over Hong Kong's decision to revoke the passports of six people accused of national security crimes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said in a statement that people who threaten national security often flee to other countries and continue to pose a threat to national security in various ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People who endanger national security often abscond overseas to avoid criminal liability and continue to endanger national security through various means, such as colluding with forces outside Hong Kong to put pressure on the central government and the Hong Kong government, or setting up organisations to endanger national security outside Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The measures taken against the fugitives are aimed at combating, deterring and preventing such conduct and facilitating their return to Hong Kong to face law enforcement and judicial proceedings."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said that the United States and other Western countries have made false and irresponsible statements to confuse the public.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) on Friday said a woman is in critical condition in intensive care with botulism after receiving botox injections at a beauty clinic in Zhuhai.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The centre said the 57-year-old woman, who was in good health, received the jabs between April 27 and May 15. About three days after the final shot, her speech became slurred and she had difficulty swallowing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CHP said she was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on May 22 but was discharged, against medical advice, the same day. The following day she was admitted again to Queen Mary after her symptoms worsened and then discharged two days later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On June 2, she was admitted to intensive care at Tseung Kwan O Hospital due to a shortage of breath, choking, and limb weakness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The centre says Botox, or botulinum toxin, injections should only be prescribed and performed by registered doctors. It said the case had been reported to mainland authorities.

    Govt confident in Kai Tak park transport facilities

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Govt confident in Kai Tak park transport facilities" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=65&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757463_1_20240614174518.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan on Friday said he's confident transport facilities would be able to cope with crowds heading to and from the Kai Tak Sports Park, as there will be various modes of transport to the venue.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An inter-departmental working group held its first meeting on Friday, and Chan said the main facilities of the park would be completed by the end of this year, and would open to the public in the first half of 2025.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The main stadium of the park can accommodate up to 50,000 spectators, and Chan said transport facilities, including the nearby Sung Wong Toi and Kai Tak MTR stations, would be able to cater all of them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If there are large-scale events, we will increase the frequency of MTR trains to boost passenger capacity. We will also arrange taxis and buses. People can also walk further to other stations, like Choi Hung MTR Station. We are confident that order will be maintained," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that authorities were planning test runs ahead of the park's opening, and they would simulate a crowd of people leaving the park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about noise complaints after a recent music festival, Chan said the main stadium of the sports park has a retractable roof, and authorities would conduct noise assessments to ensure it meets proper standards.

    Time for Hong Kong to diversify portfolio: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong must not put all its eggs in one basket and should step up efforts to explore new market opportunities, according to Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The minister acknowledged that despite high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, the SAR's economy was on target to grow by 2.5 to 3.5 percent for the full year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau felt there was a need for businesses to diversify their investment portfolio.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are seeing many opportunities around, especially in new economies in central Asia, central Europe, eastern Europe," he told reporters at a press event.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also revealed he was planning an upcoming duty visit to Peru in November, while there are plans to set up government outposts in Egypt and Turkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will be helping the motherland for inviting investment from all those new economies using Hong Kong as a gateway into the mainland," Yau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at the same event to promote Hong Kong's industries, Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry Sun Dong said a sprawling technology park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop is going ahead full steam.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He confirmed that the first three buildings within the park would be completed later this year, and authorities were still deciding how to carve out 87 hectares of space.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The park will be developed in two phases - the western side will provide around one million square metres of office space for different sectors such as artificial intelligence," Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There will also be accommodation and ancillary facilities for professionals."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The I&T minister had previously said that dozens of tech enterprises had expanded their businesses in the territory, with many of them in the life and health, new energy and microelectronics sectors.

    GBA has edge over San Francisco in finance: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's status as an international financial hub has provided a "competitive advantage" to the Greater Bay Area in financial services over its counterpart in San Francisco, according to the financial chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  One distinctive feature of the SAR, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a media interview, was the opportunity for companies to list on the city's stock exchange.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have Hong Kong, in the Greater Bay Area, being an international financial centre. We can marry both technological innovation and financial services to prosper. And this is the distinction between Hong Kong and San Francisco," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When you want to develop and grow the innovation and technology sector, you need a lot of capital... But also you need to have an [international financial centre], a listing platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Despite that, Chan said there were similarities between the two bay areas in southern China and California, with the two being "economic powerhouses".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On foreign investment to the Greater Bay Area, the financial chief said the SAR remained attractive and competitive amid the current geopolitical situation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Given this geopolitical tension, the capital market would be more volatile. Certain funding, say for example, funding from the US, may reduce their allocation to this part of the world," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But in our engagement with the investing sector in the US, they are still very keen in the Greater Bay Area and the development of China, because they believe this is the growing future. And using the Greater Bay Area is not just for the Chinese market, but also for the Asia market as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said local authorities were working hard to reach out to the international community and host mega events to clear up misunderstandings about the city, while also bringing about more than HK$10 billion into the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The financial chief also said the number of arrivals this year had risen thanks to the expansion of the solo travel scheme, allowing mainland residents to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis instead of in tour groups.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combined with a rise in consumption, hopes of lower interest rates in the near future, and the resumption of international flights, Hong Kong's economy is estimated to grow between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's property prices, which plunged by almost a quarter from its historic high in September 2021 to February this year, Chan said it's normal for housing costs to adjust amid high interest rates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He pointed out that both home prices and the number of transactions had risen after the government scrapped all property-cooling measures in February.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Friday said he believed there were many opportunities to explore in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Hong Kong could contribute with its unique strengths as an international financial centre.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking with the media on the issue, Lee said Hong Kong would achieve greater benefits through cooperation with mainland counterparts in terms of technology and talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Technology integration is important. We contribute what we have been good at, such as research, such as high quality education, and then we combine that with the high quality research and talent in the mainland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong has a strength of attracting both international talent, as well as mainland talent, and Hong Kong has been nurturing local talent. So Hong Kong has again the advantage of having the beauty of three areas, local, mainland and international. And that I think is a unique strength of Hong Kong in developing talent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the city's future role as a financial hub amid growing concerns about geopolitical tensions between East and West, Lee expressed confidence in the investment and market sentiment despite the uncertainty and added risk.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Wise investors look at markets in the long term. They know at the end, the market is always right. Politics doesn't affect the market in the long term. It will have an effect, but smart investors will find a way to absorb that political consideration and make very wise decisions based on economic development and economic opportunities," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added he accomplished two important tasks in the two years since he took office, including enacting national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law and completing the District Council elections.

    Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Cigarettes ban won't affect tourism: Lo Chung-mau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757432_1_20240614152746.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Friday brushed aside lawmakers' concerns that banning vaping and flavoured cigarettes would make Hong Kong a less attractive destination.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government last week put forward 10 measures to cut the number of smokers in the city, including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a Legco panel meeting, DAB lawmaker Starry Lee said Hong Kong would be less competitive when compared with other international financial centres which allow smoking, such as London, while retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu said the ban would discourage travellers from visiting Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, Lo said people did not come to Hong Kong just to smoke.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Most tourists who come to Hong Kong are non-smokers. Non-smokers always outnumber smokers. When they come to Hong Kong, they don't come to Hong Kong just to smoke. They come to Hong Kong to identify business opportunities. They want to experience our culinary experiences, tourism experiences, and so on,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So when we have a tobacco-free, vibrant, and healthy Hong Kong, it’s always better to have a city that is [free] of smoke.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmakers also raised concerns about the limitations in enforcement, with election committee sector lawmaker Chan Pui-leung saying there were staff shortages at the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office, and the definition of a queue was ambiguous.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, catering sector lawmaker Tommy Cheung said the government should allocate more resources to educate the youth about the dangers of smoking, rather than solely focusing on banning cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister explained that creating a tobacco-free Hong Kong would require more than just enforcement efforts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In fact, it's not just about relying on law enforcement, but also about using certain enforcement measures to establish a culture, a norm, so that everyone will know in which areas smoking is prohibited. It can also be said that everyone is a smoking control ambassador.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo added the government aims to reduce the smoking prevalence rate from the current 9.1 percent to 7.8 percent next year.

    ICAC arrests 20 over vehicle testing

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The ICAC has arrested 20 people in connection with an alleged vehicle-testing scam.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The anti-graft body accused staff of a designated private testing centre of accepting advantages from garage proprietors or middlemen, and helping private cars that did not meet the required standards to pass the exhaust emission test.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among those arrested were staff of a designated testing centre, owners of three garages in the New Territories, middlemen as well as contract workers of the Transport Department.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ten private cars were also seized in the operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the Transport Department’s requirements, all private cars manufactured for over six years must undergo an annual examination at designated test centres in order to renew their vehicle licences.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The genuine fee for the examination is HK$585. What was happening was that the owners were paying a one-stop shop price for all the service. That was between HK$2,000 and HK$3,000,” said ICAC principal investigator David Williams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the difference between those two prices is the benefits that were made for both parties in either the garage owner would get business from the customers or the testing centre staff would be receiving some of that in bribery money.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Williams said staff at the testing centre substituted the results of cars that they knew would fail with those that had already passed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ICAC said about 20 cars were referred by the garages to pass the examination fraudulently every month, and it's still trying to find out how long the syndicate has been in operation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the Transport Department said it was very concerned about the incident and would cooperate with the ICAC in the investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department said vehicle testing at the centre has been suspended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it would strengthen the management and supervision of vehicle testing centres as advised by the ICAC.

    On World Blood Donor Day, fresh appeal for donations

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Red Cross on Friday held a blood donation drive to mark World Blood Donor Day, with transfusion centres set up around town.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The chief executive and medical director of the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Dr Lee Cheuk-kwong, called on the public to donate blood with inventory being low in the past few weeks due to weather, adding that blood has a limited shelf life.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Whenever there is rain, particularly heavy rain, people may just stay at home or go to shopping malls instead of going out to donations, so this is one of the limiting factors. Also, in rainy days, some companies may not be able to work with us in arranging the blood donation drive," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Blood donations are still needed for many types of medical treatment and at the moment there's no replacement, so we need people to come out for donations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He especially called on people with blood types O and A to come forward.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the service has been targeting young people, especially university students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past few years after the pandemic, we have resumed some programmes in the young donors recruitment, in particular in the university," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Visiting schools remains one of our main objectives in our current recruitment strategies. Only the problem for us is fewer classes and students in the secondary schools, with those eligible mostly in form four, five and six."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The service collected a total of 210,103 units of blood in 2023, with just over 124,000 donors. Both figures were up from the year before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the donation process is straightforward and rewarding, adding that each donation saves three lives.

    Govt slams 'biased' European Commission report

File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757394_1_20240614120446.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong government has rejected an annual report on the SAR by the European Commission, saying it had "unfounded and biased content" on issues such as safeguarding national security and human rights.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late on Thursday, the administration also urged the European Union (EU) to stop interfering in the territory's affairs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail," a government spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The report by the commission outlined the political and economic developments in the SAR in 2023, pointing to the city's national security law and relevant court trials, as well as district council elections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These developments undermine trust in the rule of law in Hong Kong and affect Hong Kong’s standing as an international business hub," said commission vice-president Josep Borrell.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the report also noted "hopeful signs of progress on the rights of LGBTI+ people in Hong Kong, mainly carried forward by the judiciary", as well as substantial commercial links between the SAR and the EU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The administration stressed that the city's national security laws were "precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also better safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents of the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and other people, including those doing business, in the city," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Heavy rain of up to 100 millimetres an hour was recorded in parts of Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long as bad weather hit the city on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 50 millimetres of rain was recorded in other parts of the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The red rainstorm warning was in effect from 10am to 11.30am, before it was downgraded to the amber rainstorm warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Observatory said serious road flooding and traffic congestion could disrupt normal school hours and people should carefully consider the conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Education Bureau said all afternoon schools have been suspended. It also said morning and whole-day schools that were in session should continue until the end of school hours, and ensure that conditions are safe before allowing students to return home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Classes of evening schools are expected to proceed as usual.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Drainage Services Department is calling on members of the public to report any flooding, while the Labour Department said employers should ensure the safety of workers.

    LPH quality same as public housing, says NGO

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The deputy director of NGO Society for Community Organization says the quality of the first batch of light public housing matches that of standard public housing, while the rental levels are much cheaper than subdivided flats and 90 percent of standard public housing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Actually, they're quite similar to public housing... only the kitchen is open," said Sze Lai-shan while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze also said the facilities were similar to transitional social housing, which is provided by government-supported NGOs. She said in some cases it was even better as the units were new and there were electrical appliances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday the government said applications would open later this month for 4,400 of the temporary units in Ngau Tau Kok and Yuen Long. The temporary modular units are intended for people in the queue for public housing, and those who take up the offer of light public housing will remain on the public housing list. Priority will be given to those with urgent needs, such as those living in poor conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sze said some potential tenants were concerned about how many buses they would need to take, as the new units weren't linked to the MTR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, first introduced the idea of light public housing in his policy address two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the new units will range from HK$740 to HK$2,650.

 The Chinese University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies on Thursday said the personal information of more than 20,000 students, staff, faculty and visitors has been hacked.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school said it found out last week that its online learning platform had been breached, compromising data such as names, emails as well as student numbers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it was contacting those affected and that their personal details were not appearing on the dark web.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has been notified.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The school added that it is improving cybersecurity to try to prevent a repeat of the incident.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Department of Justice said on Thursday that it has filed an appeal against the acquittal of one of the defendants in a subversion case relating to an opposition plot to take control of Legco to disrupt government operations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former district councillors Lawrence Lau and Lee Yue-shun were cleared of conspiring to commit subversion under the national security law last month, with three High Court judges saying in their verdict that they were not sure if the pair had intended to subvert state power.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice said it has filed an appeal against Lau's acquittal, but that it won't challenge the judgement regarding Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fourteen others were found guilty of the subversion offence and 31 pleaded guilty earlier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mitigation hearings for those convicted will begin later this month.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) on Thursday said there are no plans to keep a makeshift hospital in Lok Ma Chau open longer than originally planned, despite its high usage and positive responses from patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital in the Lok Ma Chau Loop area was originally designed to treat Covid-19 patients. It was later turned into a temporary hospital as part of a trial to improve public healthcare services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The temporary facility began operation in April 2023 and is scheduled to run until 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Sin Ngai-chuen, clinical stream coordinator of the New Territories East Cluster, said the plan is to operate “as long as we can” and follow the directions of the government.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Central Government-Aided Emergency Hospital, by default, is a temporary building in nature. Of course, it can last for a bit longer in terms of years, but it's not going to be long-lasting because this infrastructure and all the basic facilities are going to be just temporary,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But certainly the result we have obtained here is very encouraging in terms of a pilot scheme. So we will wrap up the findings and experience and we'll try and come up with a possible future development plan.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital offers a variety of medical services, including diagnostic radiology, endoscopy, drug-resistant organism screening and sleep studies, and is now extending services to include vitamin D pathology tests.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HA said as of the end of May, the hospital had conducted more than 18,000 tests with its medical-imaging services, about 4,000 more than originally planned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The median waiting times for patients to get a CT scan, MRI scan and ultrasound scan have all been reduced, from up to 140 weeks to as short as 25 weeks, it noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And about 690 patients have taken part in the sleep studies at the hospital, with the waiting times up to three years shorter than at a general public hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sin said the HA will learn from its experience with the makeshift hospital and study the possibility of diverting more patient care to outpatient facilities, to help reduce the pressure on hospitals.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Thursday said the government will ask an independent consultant to investigate CLP power outages over the past three years, and the electricity company will have to pay for the cost of the probe.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Tse met the managing director of CLP, Joseph Law, after more than 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said the frequency of glitches has led to concerns that the service quality of CLP has declined.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) will hire an independent consultant to investigate voltage dips and power interruptions in the past three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will examine aspects such as safety designs, the power supply system's ability to resist external factors, repair work and preventative maintenance measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consultant will recommend improvement measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Tse said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The EMSD has ordered the company to hand in a detailed report on the Wong Tai Sin outage within a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP, for its part, apologised again for the inconvenience caused by the power outage.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also said it will set up a special working group with the EMSD to review how it manages the power system, and a report will be submitted to the government within one year.

    Six in 10 happy with their family life: survey

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Nearly six in 10 people have given positive feedback in a survey of family happiness conducted by Hong Kong University.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The research team, which also includes academics from the department of social work at Baptist University, invited around 4,500 adults to answer an online questionnaire between July and August 2023.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Respondents were asked to rate, on a scale of one to 10, a series of indices, including family "xingfu", a broad Chinese term for happiness and contentment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While 58 percent of participants gave a score of seven or higher, compared to a mean of 6.53, the results varied according to their socio-demographic characteristics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Higher-income individuals and homeowners tended to be more content with their lives, as well as those who were 55 or older.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Kelvin Wang, who led the study, said the findings differed from similar polls such as the World Happiness Report jointly commissioned by the United Nations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think (the World Happiness Report) is not able to 100 percent capture the xingfu ... in Chinese groups," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the West, we all know that many things which [people] do are to pursue happiness on an individual level. But for China ... the traditional wisdom is that family is almost in a higher position than individual well-being."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers also compared the results with a separate survey measuring the so-called 3Hs in family life - health, harmony and happiness. They noted a "moderate to high" correlation between the two sets of attributes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang suggested that people make an effort to communicate with their family members and be generous in offering praise, either face-to-face or through instant messaging apps.

    HK's first LPH flats open for application on June 24

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing (LPH) will open for applications from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of modular units for people waiting for public housing was introduced during Chief Executive John Lee's policy address in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters following a media visit to the flats, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said it showed the government's determination in addressing the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is only the first batch. Our target is to provide 30,000 light public housing units by the years 2026 and 2027. All the projects are in full speed. All the projects are being pushed forward on the site," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the flats range from HK$740 to HK$2,650, and tenants were expected to move in as early as the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said priority would be given to families living in poor conditions, based on a points system, adding that people in urgent need were encouraged to submit their applications before July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example families with young children... Many organisations tell us that the changes that can bring to these families are really remarkable and very obvious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because children when they grow up, like from four years old to 10 years old, this is a very critical period...if you leave them in sub-divided units in such a poor condition, it really affects their learning, their growing up and their social abilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister added that people with disabilities, families with infants and the elderly, and those who choose remote LPH sites, would also be given extra marks under the points system.

    CLP urged to explain recent power outages

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have called on CLP to give the public an explanation regarding recent power outages in the city, after over 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company says the latest blackout was caused by a faulty cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman who lives in Lung Kwong House said she struggled with the heat when her air conditioning went off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to turn on two portable fans. It lasted for four hours. I was feeling so hot. I haven't experienced such a situation since I lived here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another resident said he couldn't understand why the power company did not activate a backup system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to walk all the way up to my flat. There was no electricity, no air conditioning, and the food inside my refrigerator turned bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said there have been multiple power outages in the city in recent months and this is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expect the government to try to intervene in the situation and ask the company [CLP] to give us the full report on how to, in the long term, make the power supply become more stable," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not looking into an individual incident. We are looking at a full picture, whether they need some fundamental changes or essential improvements, so that we can guarantee the power supply is stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, who chairs Legco's panel on environmental affairs, said the threshold in the current penalty system for power companies is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said CLP would face a penalty of HK$20 million if it recorded 15 million minutes of power disruption to its customers in a year. Wednesday night's outage would have caused around one million minutes of disruption, he added.

    Lawmakers welcome East Kowloon transit system plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The smart and green mass transit system will have eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East. Photo courtesy of the Transport and Logistics Bureau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757264_1_20240613134659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday welcomed a proposal for an elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, with the project expected to be completed in 2033.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport and Logistics Bureau submitted a proposal to the Legislative Council on Wednesday to build a seven-kilometre-long system in the area, which would include six kilometres of viaducts and one kilometre of tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The smart and green mass transit system would mainly operate on an elevated corridor, and there would be eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Bill Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, said the elevated mass transit system could solve traffic congestion in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a very, very significant step that the government has already made a decision to satisfy our Kowloon East residents' long-term request to improve our traffic needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said the network needed to be fully integrated into the areas it served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government must ensure that each station is well connected with the residents, including setting up multiple different entries and also the interconnection system with the related housing estates," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said pedestrian facilities would be built to link the existing Choi Hung MTR Station with the proposed Choi Hung East Station, and Yau Tong MTR Station with the proposed Yau Tong East Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is expected to be completed in 2033, but Ngan hopes the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government should also look into possibilities of linking the system up with the Kai Tak area, such as Tsz Wan Shan and Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities would seek about HK$262.5 million of funding approval from Legco’s public works subcommittee next Wednesday.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee told lawmakers that the government's hydrogen development strategy will be unveiled next week." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757256_1_20240613130238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that officials will role out a development strategy on hydrogen next week, involving the development of hydrogen energy and vehicles powered by the gas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a question and answer session in Legco on the country's initiatives to develop new quality productive forces, Lee said the Environment and Ecology Bureau will announce its hydrogen plan on June 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said some laws may have to be changed to allow the safe storage and maintenance of the gas, which is easily combustible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will look into new facilities such as hydrogen gas stations, and officials have already approved several pilot schemes involving hydrogen-powered vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We already have [hydrogen fuel cell, HFC] buses on trial now running on the streets, and you will also be seeing the launch of several other projects," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we have plans to launch a trial project on HFC street washing vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and trams and so on. There will be trial projects too using hydrogen energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive also said the government is facing problems developing a "low-altitude economy", which is currently popular on the mainland, noting that the SAR is filled with high-rise buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB's Elizabeth Quat said there are several things Hong Kong can look into, such as helicopter transit services from the airport directly to business buildings in the Greater Bay Area, local food delivery with drones, and low-flying air tours for travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the legislature also discussed the development of cultural tourism in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Councillor Kenneth Lau, who heads the Heung Yee Kuk, proposed that the government give more funding to rural committees to promote rural cultural activities to tourists, as in-depth cultural tours are becoming more popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed that rural representatives know how to design travel itineraries, and government sponsorship would depend on particular projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, lawmaker Gary Zhang, who used to work at the MTR Corporation, said there are many transport enthusiasts in the Greater Bay Area interested in the local transport culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on the authorities to build an extra rail line connecting the planned Hung Shui Kiu Station with Sunny Bay and the Airport Express, so that travellers can get to Lantau and the airport easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he agreed with connecting the Airport Express to more lines, saying officials will seriously look into whether this would be feasible.

    The Green Earth calls for more composting capacity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Founder Edwin Lau quoted current daily composting capacity at being about a fifth of what was required. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757223_1_20240613111509.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of environmental group The Green Earth, Edwin Lau, has welcomed the government's plan to have a food waste recycling bin for each and every public housing block within two years but he says there is still room to expand the composting of waste once it is collected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Lau said government data from 2022 pointed to Hong Kong's daily food waste disposal at being over 3,300 metric tonnes but that current composting capacity was less than 20 percent of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to match both the total amount of food waste collected from the housing estates and also, at the back end, all the facilities or the food waste composting system," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the Organic Resources Recovery Centre at Siu Ho Wan in North Lantau, known as O-Park 1, was currently up and running and that O-Park 2 at Sha Ling in North District was undergoing trial runs before being operational later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two added together will be 500 tonnes of food waste capacity per day. And, besides these two, there are two sewage co-digestion plants operating, that all together total 100 tonnes per day capacity. So you add up all these four facilities and there is a maximum of 600 tonnes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said he thought the government had most likely done the calculation to match the front-end and the back-end to prevent any kind of bottle-neck from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, around 90 percent of public estates share some 700 smart recycling bins, and every estate will have at least one bin by next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment minister Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Wednesday that the plan was to match the number of blocks with the same amount of bins within two years. Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year and that more bins would be added to estates where there was strong demand.

Photo:" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757214_1_20240613095143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Engineering professor and lawmaker William Wong says one of the reasons The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) chose start-up "SmartMore" for its inaugural investment was its plan to base future research in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the financial return, part of it is the promise to create more positions for researchers. The Smart-More company promised to actually establish an research centre, an AI research centre, in Hong Kong and all these things are actually favourable to Hong Kong developing into an international information technology hub," Wong said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government investment vehicle and SmartMore signed a cooperation deal on Wednesday. The company is involved in artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC's CEO Clara Chan has said there will be different investment themes with AI in June, life sciences in July, and new energy technology in August. Professor Wong, who is the associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the Chinese University, was also asked for his views on these investment themes and whether they would suit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From this particular case, you can see the government is working very hard step by step... to satisfy the KPIs," he said referring to the investment term 'Key Performance Indicator'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Financial Secretary Paul Chan hailed the partnership between the government-owned investment vehicle and the local tech unicorn, saying it would help boost Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Parts of Wong Tai Sin plunged into darkness for four hours on Wednesday evening, with CLP saying a faulty cable was to blame for cutting off power to more than 2,200 customers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos on social media showed a number of residential buildings and shopping malls were affected by the blackout at around 8pm. Power was eventually restored shortly after midnight. Temple Mall North, Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate and Mei Tung Estate were among the areas affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said it was very concerned about the outage. "Residents were trapped in lifts and might have an uncomfortable night under this hot weather," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency shelters were set up at Tung Tau Community Centre and Wong Tai Sin Community Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Fire Services Department, there were at least four reports of people trapped in lifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power outage was caused by a malfunction in an 11,000-volt cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm apologised to those affected, adding that urgent repair work was being carried out, with emergency generators taken to the site.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Regina Ip backed the government's move to impose sanctions against six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences, saying it was necessary to demonstrate to the public that there are consequences for breaking the law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I doubt very much whether these absconders will actually come back to Hong Kong to face the law," the former security minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it will demonstrate to any potential absconders that the government takes absconding highly seriously, and there are punitive measures directed against them if they do run away from the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another former security chief-turned-lawmaker, Lai Tung-kwok, said the purpose of revoking the fugitives' passports was to limit their mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted they could still visit countries using other travel documents, such as a British National (Overseas) passport which is not recognised in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that anyone who joins paid subscriptions of websites or channels run by the six persons may be seen as providing financial aid to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said people may still fall foul of the law by simply "following" such pages, as this may indirectly help the wanted persons generate revenue through advertisements.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Education minister Christine Choi on Wednesday said a government taskforce set up to look into a  public spat involving top management at the University of Hong Kong will help with internal communication, rather than investigating specific incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang and the head of the university's governing council, Priscilla Wong, have been in conflict over senior appointments and management issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday announced the formation of the taskforce, comprising of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and head of the University Grants Council Tim Lui. It said their role will include coordinating cooperation and communication within HKU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the pair will contact or meet people involved in the matter, to find out more about the issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group doesn't have a timetable...we hope to gradually show results to the public in the process," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aim is not just to come up with a written report on the matter, we want to play an actual role."

    'Food waste bins to feature at all public housing'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="About 700 smart recycling bins for food waste have been installed at about 90 percent of public housing estates across the territory.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he expects each public housing block to have a food waste recycling bin within two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers at a Legco meeting, he said about 700 smart recycling bins for food waste were installed at about 90 percent of public estates across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the smart recycling bins would be installed at all public estates in Hong Kong by next month, which was a month ahead of the original schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added more bins would be installed at public estates, with the goal of installing a bin at each public housing block within two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmakers questioned if the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some old residents told me that there are 11 blocks in their estate, with 380 units, but there are only three food waste smart recycling bins in the whole estate... Can we expedite the process and have one bin in each block within one year?" lawmaker Kitson Yang asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said discussions would be made with the Housing Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see which residential buildings have higher usage of food waste smart recycling bins, and we will install more bins at those estates with higher usage. We will also replace the inner bins of the recycling bins more often to enhance its capacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    Woman loses final appeal over Quarry Bay shootings

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's top court has dismissed an appeal by a woman who was jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle and wounding two other relatives. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757064_1_20240612115331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle lost her final appeal against her convictions for murder on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former bodyguard Tsim Sum-kit also shot and wounded two other relatives in the attack in Quarry Bay Park in 2018, following a family lunch to discuss dividing up the estate of her late grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a High Court trial in 2021, the defence failed to the convince the jury that Tsim had suffered from an abnormality of the mind which resulted in an impairment of mental responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her latest appeal, Tsim argued that the legal requirement for a defendant to prove they suffer from diminished responsibility – if this is to be used as a partial defence to murder – infringes upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a written judgement, a panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges said the question of diminished responsibility does not affect the presumption of innocence as it is not an ingredient of the offence a defendant is charged with, but an extenuating mitigating circumstance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said diminished responsibility is a factor that only comes into play if and when prosecutors have proven a defendant's guilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The partial defence of diminished responsibility does not in any way reduce the burden on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence of murder," the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is only when a defendant is prima facie guilty of murder that the plea of diminished responsibility becomes relevant. If the prosecution has not already discharged the onus of proving the actus reus and mens rea of murder, the defendant will be entitled to an outright acquittal on the charge of murder and the plea of diminished responsibility will have no further relevance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsim had also asked the court to consider whether the requirement under the Homicide Ordinance for the defence to prove diminished responsibility is proportionate and justified, or whether offering some evidence to support the claim ought to be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this point, the judges said the ordinance has "the legitimate aim of alleviating the prosecution from an unworkable burden arising from the practical difficulties of proving a matter so personal to the accused".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that a number of factors support this conclusion, including "the fact mental disorders and their effects are not part of ordinary life experience of a jury [and] the fact an accused cannot be compelled to be subject to medical examination by the prosecution."

    CUHK unveils novel bladder cancer surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dr Jeremy Teoh (seated) says the new surgery technique can remove the whole tumour in one piece rather than fragmenting it, reducing the chance of the cancer returning. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=70&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757084_1_20240612145650.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese University’s Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it had identified a new surgery technique that was better at preventing bladder cancer from recurring in patients compared with traditional procedures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three hundred and fifty bladder cancer patients participated in the clinical trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of them underwent a new surgery technique called en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) and the other half underwent traditional procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jeremy Teoh, who led the research, noted that the one-year cancer recurrence rate for patients who had received traditional surgery was between 30 and 40 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, Teoh said the recurrence rate in those who had received ERBT dropped to about 28 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Essentially during the [new] surgery, we try to preserve the whole tumour, try not to touch it, avoid fragmentation of the tumour, and also the whole specimen can be retrieved in one piece to ensure a complete resection by histology,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is currently available at 13 hospitals in Hong Kong, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teoh said all bladder cancer patients with a tumour size of less than three centimetres could consult with their doctors about having the new surgery.

    'Retailers must maintain their competitiveness'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Wednesday urged the retail sector to enhance its efforts in maintaining its competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at the Hong Kong Retail Summit, organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Yau said economic activity in the city had returned to normal and tourist numbers were growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau said the retail sector still faced various challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must also confront the various new challenges facing the retail industry, as the preferences and behaviour patterns of tourists - and Hongkongers - are changing," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Retailers must keep pace with these changes, continuously innovate, and adjust their operational strategies in order to maintain their competitiveness and advantage in an ever-changing market environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the summit, the chairwoman of the city’s retail management association, Annie Yau-Tse, said the retail performance in both the tourist and local markets had been disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We [have been seeing] the trend of [budget travel] since last year. That's why we see that the tourists are actually focusing on enjoying their time in Hong Kong, like taking photos, but not really buying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This trend is actually really affecting our industry, because in the past we have been making a lot of business out of the tourists who are actually coming for shopping. But nowadays, you don't really see too many people carrying their suitcases for shopping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau-Tse said retailers in Hong Kong should leverage technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to understand consumer patterns better and create tailored promotion plans to adapt to the changing market dynamics.
