<div class="itemFullText">
 It would be unrealistic to try to stop people from spending their free time across the border and abroad, Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday, amid complaints from local retailers and restaurants over flagging business as more Hongkongers choose to spend their money elsewhere.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee advised the retail industry to acknowledge the structural change in consumption patterns, and address the problem by seeking reform.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a joint radio phone-in programme, one day after delivering his third Policy Address, Lee said the SAR is undergoing a period of transition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It’s time to stop dwelling on the past success, he told businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Overall speaking, the retail industry isn’t doing really well. Even as we boost inbound tourism, we must first acknowledge the structural change of their consumption pattern," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Everyone needs to keep improving – not just the one in front of you or next to you. Start with yourself. Of course the government will try to help, but there will be ups and downs," he said, adding that he aims to compress this "transition period" as much as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many Hong Kong retailers and restaurants also say they are struggling to compete for customers against rivals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and other parts of the Greater Bay Area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly one and half million Hong Kong residents left the city via various land borders over the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend, dealing a fresh blow to local businesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Lee said this is only normal market behaviour, and the government will do its best to help local businesses, including looking at ways to tackle high rent and costs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that being as Hong Kong’s economy is undergoing a period of change, one of the government’s roles is to look for new growth areas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities will now look into building a commodity trading ecosystem, leveraging on Hong Kong’s safe and free environment, he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A “global trader” has signalled its intention to establish a metal warehouse in Hong Kong, Lee said, describing this as the perfect starting point.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a separate note, the chief executive pledged to forge full speed ahead with a plan to regulate subdivided homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He has proposed a bill which will set a minimum size and other conditions for the units, and landlords which don't register their properties will be prosecuted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With an estimated 110,000 such units, Lee said one headache would be deciding how long the registration period should last.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm an impatient man...I said, how about 12 to 18 months? But with 110,000 units to deal with, and divided by 12 months, we have to register about 9,000 each month. Is this pragmatic? I would need to discuss this with my colleagues," he said.

    'New HOS rules help people climb housing ladder'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee says the Housing Authority will allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774925_1_20241017101330.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An analyst at a local think-tank has welcomed this year's Policy Address as one focused on improving the quality of people's lives, saying the increased chances for young people to attain an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme would motivate them to climb up the housing ladder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jason Leung, the Head of Land and Housing at the Our Hong Kong Foundation, made the comment on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme on Thursday after Chief Executive John Lee said the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the past, if we are talking about Home Ownership Scheme flats, the numbers offered for sale each year is very low. It's about 3,000 to 4,000 a year perhaps. Now it's getting more and more and moving to about 8,000 to 9,000 per year. So it's slightly easier to get a flat in the balloting right now and especially with the new mechanism that people who previously were unsuccessful in the balloting could get you know more ballots," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Youths could get a more preferential treatment as well. So the Home Ownership Scheme flats, these are more accessible to these people right now, and I think that this will be a positive direction for people to attain home ownership."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Leung said residents living in subdivided units that do not meet the minimum standards could potentially be moved to transitional housing given its flexible conditions, after Lee said the government would propose a new set of standards which include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If you look at the distribution of transitional housing, actually there are quite a number of them that are in the urban areas as well, and as the government constructs more light public housing and public rental housing in the coming few years, existing tenants in the transitional housing could move on to these government-run housing programmes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The space in these transitional housing in the urban areas can then be released and hopefully used to house these people that could be affected by these subdivided units."

    Beijing relaxes visa rules for non-Chinese HKers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland authorities on Wednesday further relaxed visa rules for non-Chinese Hong Kong residents, allowing for more people to apply for multiple-entry visas that allow individual visits of up to six months.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Back in July, mainland authorities announced a five-year card for non-Chinese permanent Hong Kong residents, allowing them to travel to the mainland. The card allows stays of up to 90 days and use of the speedier e-gates at immigration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Commissioner's Office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said that with immediate effect, both permanent and non-permanent residents of Hong Kong who are non-Chinese can apply for the visas of up to five years, with each trip lasting a maximum 180 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[This is] to facilitate personnel exchanges between Hong Kong and the mainland, [and] support Hong Kong’s integration into the overall development of the country," the office said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said that this applies to applicants going to the mainland for business, travel, visiting family members, as well as cultural and academic exchanges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applicants will not need to submit a receipt for return transport tickets and hotel bookings. They also will not have to get their fingerprints recorded again if they underwent the procedure during a previous visa application.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The office added that the new policy does not apply to foreign domestic workers.

    Principal moratorium will help SMEs: chamber

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Patrick Yeung of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce says the measures unveiled in the Policy Address will help small and medium enterprises address their financial challenges. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774834_1_20241016173752.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday welcomed the measures unveiled in the Policy Address to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think most important to note is that the proposal to revive the mortgage moratorium, to allow the SMEs to repay the interest rather than the capital for the month borrowed for the mortgage," the chamber's CEO Patrick Yeung told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's a way to help them to address the current financial challenges."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee announced in his policy blueprint that SMEs can apply for a principal moratorium for up to 12 months to ease their cash-flow pressure, if they borrow money under government-backed loan schemes. Authorities will also offer partial principal repayment options.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On government plans to kick-start the city's low-altitude economy by exploring the use of aerial technology, such as drones, Yeung said officials need to overcome technical challenges if they are to make use of low-altitude airspace for economic activity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have to look into the infrastructure, then where will be the good place to put up a space, and where to put up charging facilities, et cetera," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, it's a good idea, but definitely not an easy one to tackle with all those technical challenges possible facing this low-altitude economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will set up a cross-departmental task force led by the deputy financial secretary to explore the use of technologies at the airspace within an altitude of up to 1,000 metres.

    'Liquor duty cut won't have big effect on prices'
   </title>
   <link>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The wine and spirits industry on Wednesday said Hong Kong's reduction in duty on premium spirits won't have a huge effect on the sector, or the public.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The duty on liquor with an alcohol content above 30 percent and with an import price of over HK$200 has been cut from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong General Chamber of Wine and Spirits welcomed the move, but said the change will only be noticed when it comes to luxury products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it's not easy for the industry, also for the catering sector to slash prices at this moment. I think it only benefits those expensive items, for example, [those with a] retail price of over HK$1,000," Raymond Luk, who chairs the chamber's economic policy and social affairs committee, told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Man, general manager at Wai Shing Wine and Spirits, said only around 20 percent of customers buy spirits that are priced over HK$1,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We originally hoped that citizens would be able to use around HK$500 to HK$800 to buy and enjoy liquor of better quality. But the policy now... consumers will still have to increase their budget to get better spirits, it is hard to tell whether they will be willing to do that," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Man said he would like to see the HK$200 threshold for the duty cut reduced by half, so more kinds of liquor would be covered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk added that such a move would increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's liquor market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the current rates under the new policy, we are still the highest in East Asia. But in the long term, I think it's possible that we'll gain an increased appeal as a high-end spirit destination due to the reduction in taxes, as well as the speeding up of the development of activities related to high-end prestige spirits like trading, distribution and auctions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said officials moved to slash the tax on hard liquor because they saw market opportunities similar to the ones that followed after the duty on wine was abolished in 2008.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press conference, Lee said officials made the decision considering that around 85 percent of hard liquor in the market is priced under HK$200.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the objective was to boost the trade in high-end liquor and hoped it would have a similar effect to the abolition of wine duties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee noted the import and re-export value of red wine last year rose by 375 percent compared to 2007, the year before the product became tax free in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over one year after wine duty has been reduced, we saw an increase of about 350 operators of wine, and an increase of about 1,000 jobs. The income for that sector increased by about 35 percent," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee stressed the government isn't encouraging people to drink, saying it has struck a balance between public health and the need to develop the hard liquor market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Licensed Bar and Club Association, meanwhile, said that though bar operators support the tax cut, it might not bring immediate benefits.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's founding president, Ben Leung, said he thinks the measures can boost Hong Kong's competitiveness in the global liquor market in the long run, because more brands and different types of spirits would enter the local market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But bars cannot benefit immediately because above them [in the chain], there are importers and agents, they themselves might need some time to digest [the news] and make adjustments. They might not have room to lower prices immediately," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung also called on the Chief Executive to review how to better promote the local night economy, saying that would "expand the room for survival" for small to medium enterprises.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A concern group says the government needs to think of ways to settle affected residents. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774796_1_20241016154136.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Reactions to the government’s plan to eradicate poor quality subdivided units (SDUs) were largely supportive, although there were also calls for the administration to ensure adequate follow-up actions to support affected tenants during the transition.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The proposed new laws require each unit to be at least eight square metres, or 86 square feet in size and have its own toilet and windows.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A concern group said it estimates that 20 percent of the city's 110,000 subdivided units would be affected under the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Kenny Ng from the Concerning Grassroot Housing Rights Alliance called on the government to come up with ways to make sure affected tenants had a place to live.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The government didn't mention how to relocate those residents who are living in subdivided flats who will be affected under this scheme."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Will they be arranged to some other housing for their relocation, or will they just let them rent other private housing themselves? If so, I think those deprived groups will rent some other subdivided flats which will be illegal,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ng said the government could consider using unused public housing or transitional housing units to settle affected residents.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, an NGO that connects deprived groups with landlords said the government should establish a clear timeline for when the law will be in place.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lai Kin-kwok from the ComHome Social Housing Platform also called for more detailed criteria regarding the minimum living standards for subdivided units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We can't find the timeline, especially when the law will be established and then how long the grace period is."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I think from the information now, we don't know whether the windows can be opened or not... And regarding the eight square metres, I think that's the minimum standard, but it depends on how many residents are inside the eight square metres,” Lai said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He anticipated that landlords of subdivided flats not affected by the proposed laws would consider increasing rents, saying he was disappointed the Policy Address did not address the need for a rent cap.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sources said a two-month consultation will take place in December, with the aim of submitting related legislative proposals to Legco next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in a media briefing after the Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said it would take a few years to root out the problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "First of all, we'll have to pass the legislation, which I think the earliest will probably be next year. Then, we will introduce the registration period. My suggestion is either 12 months or 18 months," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Then we'll introduce the tolerance period for adjustments, structurally, to be made. That may be one year, two years, again subject to discussion by Legco."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the sources, penalties for landlords who fail to make improvements after the grace period would include possible imprisonment and fines.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But for a subdivided tenant surnamed Au, the law enforcement actions might not pose a deterrent effect to her landlord.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She pays a monthly rent of HK$2,500 for 20-square-foot room with no individual toilet and kitchen, a space that falls in the sub-standard SDU category.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In this flat, if they combine two rooms and provide more than 90 [square] feet, I’m fine. They have a window, I’m fine. I don’t mind if there is no air conditioning. But I think my landlord will not change, he'll just pay the penalty without doing anything if the government penalises him,” Au said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The environment I have now, if I have to be honest, what difference is there from sleeping on the streets? It’s bad that there is no air con on the streets and dust and dirt is emitted from cars, but at least you feel more comfortable and have more space,” she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Au said she had doubts about whether the government could carry out its plan successfully and would stay in her unit until she gets allocated public housing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. Like if tomorrow I buy a lottery ticket, I don’t know if I will win,” she said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The property sector on Wednesday welcomed the government's move to ease mortgage restrictions, saying it will significantly boost the property market and the overall economy.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his third Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee announced that the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for homes will be adjusted to 70 percent regardless of their value, while the maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) will be raised to 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hannah Jeong, from real estate services firm CBRE, said she thinks the relaxation will boost transaction volumes, especially in the luxury market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will give a better liquidity for the homebuyers, the people who are looking for the upgrading demand, or they want to enter the market [for the] first time given the good discount offering from the developers. And their down payment amount has been reduced by utilising this LTV ratio increase," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So this improvement will affect, in a possible way, the luxury residential [market] more, because previously it was only 60 percent."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Joseph Tsang, chairman of real estate services company JLL, said the LTV move will boost transaction volumes for new residential projects, but it won't be strong enough to reverse the downward trend in housing prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The future trend of Hong Kong housing prices will largely depend on the effectiveness of economic stimulus measures introduced by the mainland government," he wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Real estate and construction sector lawmaker Louis Loong also welcomed the changes, adding that he is happy to see the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit back to pre-2009 levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This sends a very positive message to the entire property market. We have always told the government that a weak property market is not beneficial for Hong Kong's overall economy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe this will have a very positive effect on Hong Kong's entire property market and even on the economy as a whole."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Still, the founder and chief executive of Centaline Property Group, Shih Wing-ching, said some remained concerned about potential declines in property values despite the relaxation in mortgage rules.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "What now worries people is no longer the difficulty to get a mortgage loan. People worry about the risk of further declines in property value. So quite a lot of people now choose to rent rather to purchase. If they choose to rent, the relaxation of this ratio could not do them any good," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This policy of course can help a little bit, but the property market is more complex. You need to also look at interest rates, supply and demand. The problem now is that people have not really established their faith in the future, so they are not willing to commit too much at this moment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shih added the move alone is not enough to boost developers' appetite for land because it also depends on improvements in transaction volumes and inventory levels in the primary market.

    Govt to subsidise care-home spots in Guangdong
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is launching a new pilot scheme to subsidise elderly welfare recipients to live in care homes in Guangdong, while it will also expand an existing subsidy programme to include more facilities in the province.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said in his new Policy Address that a three-year pilot programme will allow up to 1,000 elderly people who are currently receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) to receive monthly subsidies of HK$5,000 to live in designated residential care homes in Guangdong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The existing Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong, meanwhile, will be expanded, with seven more residential homes joining the programme in November 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government is also providing more help to needy elderly people who want to remain in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said there will be a 20-percent increase in the number of vouchers given out to elderly people in need of care, but are still waiting for a subsidised spot in a home.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six-thousand vouchers will be given out to allow beneficiaries to be admitted to homes of their choice without the need to wait further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive also announced other poverty-alleviation measures in his Policy Address, including more than doubling the number of schools offering after-school care services for primary students to allow their parents to work; and expanding its existing “Strive and Rise” programme, where underprivileged children are matched up with mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The School-based After-School Care Service Scheme will increase from 50 to over 110 schools, Lee said, and more schools will be encouraged to join, such that there’s no planned cap to the number of students who can benefit from the programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An additional 100 day child care services will be provided at new child care centre, and service places under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project will be increased by 25 percent, to 2,500.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Wednesday that the government will step up its support for young people hoping to buy subsidised flats.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He announced in his Policy Address that the Housing Authority would allocate an extra ballot number to young families and single-person applicants aged below 40, to increase their chances of getting an apartment under the Home Ownership Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that starting from the next White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) exercise, the quota for those flats will increase by 1,500 -- all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants under the age of 40.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And in a bid to encourage more public housing tenants to buy Home Ownership Scheme units, the government said it will revise the allocation between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants from its current ratio of 4:6 to 5:5.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, as part of efforts to crack down on tenancy abuse, the Housing Authority will launch the "Cherish Public Housing Resources Award Scheme" in January next year, offering rewards to anyone providing intelligence that helps to identify such cases.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also said the government hopes to cut the average waiting time for public rental housing from the current 5.5 years to 4.5 years in 2026-27.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The principal moratorium scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) will be relaunched as part of efforts to help businesses as Hong Kong undergoes economic restructuring.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee said in his Policy Address on Wednesday that firms will be allowed to apply for principal moratorium for up to 12 months under the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum loan guarantee periods of the 80 percent and 90 percent guarantee products will be extended to 10 years and eight years respectively, while the partial principal repayment options will be offered to new loans under the two guarantee products.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures to support SMEs include a HK$1 billion injection into the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Sales to help them upgrade their operations and develop new markets, as well as fresh efforts to further promote Hong Kong brands.

    Loan-to-value ratio for mortgages to be relaxed: CE
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The loan-to-value ratio will be relaxed to 70 percent. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774730_1_20241016122657.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 In a bid to encourage more people to purchase a home and to stimulate the city's property market, Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government would relax the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of mortgage loans.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This would allow people to borrow more against the value of a property they want to buy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Outlining the proposal in his Policy Address, Lee said the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would adjust the maximum LTV ratio for homes to 70 percent, regardless of their value, whether the properties were for self-use or not, or were being purchased by first-time buyers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum debt servicing ratio (DSR) would be adjusted to 50 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For non-residential properties, the maximum LTV ratio and the maximum DSR would be adjusted to the same levels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HKMA said the adjustments apply to provisional sale and purchase agreements signed from Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Taking into account the latest market developments, the HKMA has decided to adjust the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans and revert the maximum LTV ratio and DSR limit to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced," HKMA chief executive Eddie Yue said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Even with these adjustments announced today, the Hong Kong banking sector has ample buffers to cope with any challenges from a sharp correction in property prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I would like to remind the public that buying a property is a long-term financial commitment. Prospective buyers should carefully assess the risks involved and their ability to afford a property."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also announced that the government will relax a policy granting residency to people who invest a minimum of HK$30 million in different forms of assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starting from Wednesday, purchases of property worth HK$50 million or more will be counted as fulfilling a third of the requirement for the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme. The amount of real estate investment to be counted towards the total capital investment is capped at $10 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV forum, Lee brushed off concerns that the relaxation could lead to an overheating of property prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because their investment will not affect the willingness of our citizens to buy houses. We only allow them [investors] to buy properties valued over HK$50 million," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now, the property market is starting to stabilise. We are not worried that will result in any negative impact. I think that will attract more investment while benefiting the growth of our real estate market."

    Culture, sport and pandas to bring visitors to HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Wednesday said the government is working on a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's status as a cultural, sports and tourism magnet.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his Policy Address, Lee said the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) will release a blueprint later this year on promoting Chinese culture, the development of arts and culture with an international perspective, fostering arts and cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, and driving industry development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency is incubating cultural and creative projects with a potential for industrialisation and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and leveraging market resources to help the sector explore business opportunities, the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Turning to the West Kowloon Cultural District, Lee said the authority running the arts hub will take a leading role in building Hong Kong's strengths in arts trading and the restoration and exhibition of high-end private art collections.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the authority will promote the district as a prime destination for major international cultural events, while also curating arts programmes and exhibitions to be staged on the mainland and overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will continue to foster sports development by enhancing the development of athletes and coaches, and promoting sports in the community by providing more facilities, including a swimming complex suitable for international competitions and a sports arena with fencing facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the government will develop a "host city economy" in the sports industry, so local athletes can compete in international events on home soil.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE noted that Kai Tak Sports Park will open in the first quarter of next year and said the site will "boost sports development and inject impetus into related industries such as recreation, entertainment and tourism and also mega-event economy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On tourism, Lee said the government will develop Hong Kong into a premier destination through innovative thinking and by making better use of rich and unique resources such as Victoria Harbour, the outlying islands, rural areas, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles and historic buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These elements, combined with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture and more will help to instil the concept of 'tourism is everywhere'", he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CSTB will publish a blueprint for the tourism industry later this year, which among other things will cover developing eco-tourism such as "island-hopping tours", and attracting tourists from the Middle East and Asean members with measures such as information in Arabic at the airport, a list of halal restaurants, and encouraging hotels to provide worship facilities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other plans include the promotion of "yacht tourism", "panda tourism", "horse-racing tourism" and a gourmet guide covering all 18 districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A working group led by the chief secretary is also going to be set up to identify and develop tourist hotspots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said Beijing is studying SAR government proposals to enhance visas for visitors from the mainland, including the resumption of a multiple-entry arrangement for Shenzhen residents, while the criteria for multiple-entry visas will be relaxed for people from Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar.

    Govt to improve standards of subdivided units

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chief executive said in his Policy Address on Wednesday the government would introduce legislation for a system to govern the renting of subdivided flats, with the goal of helping people improve their conditions by insisting on standards that ensure the health and safety of those that live in these types of units.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sub-divided units (SDUs) which meet the required living standards would be named as Basic Housing Units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  John Lee said the government would propose the standards of Basic Housing Units should include the provision of windows, an individual toilet, and a floor area of no less than eight square metres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said current SDUs differ significantly in standards and it was necessary to set a minimum standard to eradicate subdivided flats which are not fit to live in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under appropriate regulation, the market demand for SDUs would be satisfied by introducing these revamped Basic Housing Units which meet the required standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SDUs that are of poor quality must be converted into Basic Housing Units that meet the required standards. Upon conversion, certified professionals must give their approval to ensure the conversion meets the minimum standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Owners who continue to rent out substandard SDUs under the new system would be held criminally liable, while tenants would not be held liable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government would allow time for owners of existing SDUs to carry out the necessary renovation works to meet the new standards. A grace period would be implemented during which enforcement action would not be taken against the illegal renting of subdivided flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Secretary for Housing would be empowered by law to decide, upon expiry of the grace period, when to take enforcement action against sub-standard SDUs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The deputy financial secretary and secretary for housing would announce further details and seek the views of Legco and other stakeholders for drawing up the legislative proposals and related measures.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee has outlined proposals to attract more overseas students to study in tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774725_1_20241016122037.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee outlined plans to develop Hong Kong into an international tertiary education hub in his Policy Address with various measures such as creating the "Study in Hong Kong" brand and encouraging more local students to pursue advanced studies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The government will encourage local post-secondary institutions to enhance collaboration with their counterparts around the world in promoting the "Study in Hong Kong" brand on a global scale, with an aim to attract more overseas students to study here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added Hong Kong will strive to host international education conferences and exhibitions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE also announced the setting up of the Hong Kong Future Talents Scholarship Scheme for Advanced Studies from the 2025/26 academic year, offering scholarships each year to up to 1,200 local students enrolling in designated postgraduate programmes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With a projected shortage of 180,000 workers across different sectors in Hong Kong in the next five years, Lee said the government will reform its talent admission schemes to try to attract more staff from overseas.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It'll add 13 top mainland and overseas universities to the list of institutions under the Top Talent Pass Scheme, raising the total to 198, and the validity period of the first visa of high-income talent will be extended from two to three years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the other measures is the introduction of a new mechanism under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme, inviting top talent to come here for development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government will set up a new committee – the Committee on Education, Technology and Talents – to coordinate the integrated development of those fields. It'll be led by the chief secretary.

 Duty on spirits has been reduced to help promote the liquor trade, Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The government has made reference to the successful experience of driving the wine trade through exemption of wine duty and will, starting today, reduce the duty rate for liquor with an import price of over HK$200 from 100 percent to 10 percent for the portion above HK$200," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The move applies to liquor with an alcoholic strength of more than 30 percent, and the duty on spirits with an import price of HK$200 or below remains unchanged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In recent months, industry representatives had called for a reduction in the duty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the cut will boost the development of high value added industries including tourism and logistics and storage, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption.

    Govt sets sights on developing low-altitude economy
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is looking to kick-start Hong Kong’s low-altitude economy by launching a new working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services from transporting goods and people, to assisting in rescue work and providing high-resolution surveys.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In his latest Policy Address, Chief Executive John Lee said “formulating a management system for low-altitude economy will help drive development in areas such as telecommunication technologies, AI and the digital industry, unlocking the low-altitude airspace as a new production factor for our economy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The group will be led by the deputy financial secretary and focus on kick-starting projects with good prospects, as well as develop broader strategies and action plans, and work out regulatory issues and infrastructure needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It will be tasked with launching pilot projects to explore the best applications – including drones for delivery, surveys, building maintenance, aerial photography, performances as well as for search and rescue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many mainland cities have been working to develop low-altitude economies – encompassing services like delivery drones or flying taxis and other aerial vehicles within airspace below 1,000 metres – and Hong Kong has been under pressure to keep up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another group led by the deputy chief secretary will bring various government departments together, and leverage community efforts to identify and develop “tourist hotspots of high popularity and with strong appeal in various districts”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Two other groups will focus on promoting the “integrated development” of education, technology and talents, and accelerate the development of the “silver industry” to help meet the daily needs of the elderly.

    John Lee starts Policy Address with call for change

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee started his third Policy Address on Wednesday morning with a call to embrace change, noting Beijing’s support for Hong Kong’s development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Sporting a green tie designed by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University showcasing Hong Kong’s iconic skyline, Lee opened his speech at the Legislative Council by noting the resolution adopted at the third plenum of the Communist Party in July to further deepen reform to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The Resolution calls on Hong Kong to fully harness the institutional strengths of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ while consolidating and enhancing its status aas an international hub for high-calibre talents, to exert a greater role in our country’s opening up to the world, and to deepen collaboration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area through better harmonisation of rules and mechanisms,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said from the time he was running for the top job, he has been emphasising the need to embrace reform, and had put in place a series of measures to tackle issues such as enhancing district services, cutting waiting times for public housing, and addressing intergenerational poverty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that we must maintain our development momentum and self-renewal, and that we must embrace changes while staying principled, innovative and flexible in meeting challenges and opportunities.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE had earlier said his latest policy blueprint will focus on lifting the economy and on livelihood issues. The official theme for the address is “Reform for Enhancing Development and Building Our Future Together.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Organisers on Tuesday confirmed that four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will compete in the Hong Kong Open tennis championships later in October.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Osaka, who won the Australian Open in 2019 and 2021 and the US Open in 2018 and 2020, is the first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam and the first player from Asia to hold the singles' top ranking, claiming the World No. 1 spot in January 2019, which she held for 21 weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She will be joined by Russia's Diana Shnaider and Anastasia Potapova, who is ranked 37th in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Twenty-year-old Shnaider is the youngest player currently ranked in the world's top 16, and has won three titles this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At the 2024 Olympic Games, she partnered with Mirra Andreeva to capture the silver medal in the women's doubles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other international stars already confirmed to compete in the event include defending champion Leylah Fernandez of Canada, two-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania and Britain's highest-ranked player Katie Boulter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  China's Paris Olympic mixed doubles silver medalist Wang Xinyu, and rising stars Yuan Yue and Wang Xiyu will also feature in the field competing for a total prize purse worth US$250,000. (Xinhua)

 Police said dozens of turtles were stolen from an industrial building in Tsuen Wan on Tuesday.

  Officers received a report at 10am that the front door of a unit had been forced open and there were signs the interior had been ransacked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They estimated about 50 eastern box turtles were missing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said three men, aged in their early 40s and who reportedly wore black clothing, are suspects in the case.

    Gym chain customers urged to be wary of new deal

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged former members of the now-defunct gym chain Physical Fitness to think carefully before signing a new agreement with perFIT, the operator who took over the business.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The gym chain is offering former Physical Fitness members free access to reopened locations in Mong Kok and Wan Chai, along with any remaining private training sessions they had paid for, provided that they sign an agreement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the clauses state that the free period only lasts for up to three years and there will be a monthly fee afterwards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The consent form also requires members to grant perFIT access to their previous contracts and personal information.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, GIlly Wong, said about 10 percent of complaints regarding the closing down of Physical Fitness involved losses exceeding HK$100,000, adding that those affected should consider their personal situation and legal rights before deciding whether to sign the consent form.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Obviously we spotted that because of the diverse range of packages, classes, terms, expiry period of membership, the situation of every individual could be quite different. But in general, for those with shorter terms and also lesser amount, it’s more easy for them to accept the new proposal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “On the other hand, for those customers who have a bigger amount with a much longer duration and have many private classes, that may require review on every individual,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said the council will continue to hold talks with perFIT and work on a mutually agreeable solution for everyone involved.

    Keep an eye out for 'shrinkflation': watchdog
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged consumers to stay vigilant when shopping in supermarkets, noting retailers are taking advantage of downsized products to effect price hikes.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it surveyed 62 supermarket products, including food, daily necessities and pet food with volume or weight changes over the past 3.5 years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It found that nearly all of them had seen weight or volume reduction ranging from about one percent to as much as 30 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost 40 percent of products showed a de facto price increase, with the highest reaching 26.2 percent based on the average per-unit recommended retail price, the council noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong said while it is reasonable for retailers to seek profit-making measures, they should also be fair to consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because usually for this kind of little change, consumers may not easily spot it except you follow the product for a long, long time. You are so loyal to that, then you follow," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Otherwise, when there's a modest change, like this time, [a drop of] only three grams of instant noodle or maybe 20 grams of body lotion, it's really hard for consumers to keep track of that."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted that while some countries, like South Korea, have implemented legislation to increase transparency regarding changes in product size, such as listing the unit price, this may not be the optimal solution for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The reason is Hong Kong is a very open market. We import a lot of products worldwide. We don't have our self-production that much. So, if we ask the government to legislate according to what other markets have been doing right now, we have to consider whether it is the most effective measure," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council advised consumers to pay close attention to a product's volume or weight, and compare products using unit pricing, if they want to objectively assess their expenses.

    Vitamin C serum claims can be misleading: watchdog

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Consumer Council on Tuesday urged people to select beauty products carefully after it found inconsistencies in some products boasting vitamin C content.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The watchdog said it tested 17 serums and 10 of them had a lower concentration of vitamin C than the manufacturer claimed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While one actually had more vitamin C than advertised, another one had none whatsoever.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council’s chief executive, Gilly Wong, said they have referred their findings to the authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have already shared this report to the Customs and Excise Department. So if there is any alleged infringement of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, they would take an independent enforcement action on that,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The watchdog urged manufacturers to improve their labelling practices, noting that five of the products tested failed to list the vitamin C concentration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In addition, the label for one serum didn't mention an expiry date, while six others didn't have a list of ingredients in either English or Chinese.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The council also discovered that seven of the serums contained fragrance allergens with restricted use in the EU, saying eczema sufferers or individuals with allergies could develop contact dermatitis or rashes from overexposure to the products.

    Officials getting to the bottom of monkey deaths: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that officials need to make sure that parts of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens are properly sealed off, following the deaths of nine monkeys there.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officials have been investigating the mysterious deaths, as they held a meeting on Monday chaired by Kevin Yeung, the culture, sports and tourism minister.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee told reporters that officials need to focus on several things, and one of them is ensuring the affected area of the zoo doesn't expand further.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The relevant section has been closed off. Disinfection has been conducted. So we have contained the area," he said before the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The second step is to control. Apart from the cleaning and disinfection, we have to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that the problem will not spread."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said autopsies, tests and toxicology analyses should be completed as soon as possible so that experts can find out the reasons behind the deaths.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Workers need to wear protective gear properly, Lee added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said Yeung is in charge of the issue, and officials will provide an update once there is a new development.

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said the number of mainland visitors during the recent Golden Week holiday showed a "good increase".
 <br>
  <br/>
  Talking to reporters ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said 1.22 million visitors came to Hong Kong during the holiday period.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It was up 27 percent compared with the Golden Week last year, and it was also an increase of 13 percent compared with the Golden Week in May," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were... over 1,000 mainland tourist groups visiting Hong Kong. The actual figure is 1,050. Eighty percent of these tour groups actually stayed overnight."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Citing industry figures, the chief executive said restaurants saw increased turnover during the week, as they also benefited from events to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The catering business was doing quite well because the association indicated that there was about 2 billion dollars of business during Golden Week, which was a five percent increase," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A lot of representatives of different sectors and businesses have indicated that during the Golden Week, there were larger numbers of visitors, customers, and also there was an increase in the business turnover."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the National Day fireworks display attracted over 330,000 people, and about 190,000 movie-goers took advantage of half-price tickets that day, up 22 percent year-on-year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said 60,000 people visited museums and art spaces managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department on October 1, when admission was free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that 4.43 million people also enjoyed free or discounted journeys that day on a number of modes of transport.

 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday that carrying out reforms together is among the themes of this year's Policy Address, which he will deliver on Wednesday morning.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He said the cover of the blueprint's hard copy will be in green again, because this reflects the sustainability of government policies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that the colour can also mean harmony, vitality and prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know that everybody's very keen to know about the content of the Policy Address. The theme of the Policy Address is we will reform for enhancing development and building our future together," he told reporters ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE added that there will be a supplement in place of a document on policies implemented in the past couple of years, which he hopes people don't overlook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee's predecessor, Carrie Lam, introduced supplements for her blueprint in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Lee said new amendments that Beijing and local officials signed as part of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) last week didn't come easy, as he once again thanked the central government for making it happen.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the idea to amend the agreements, which cover various service industries, was led by the Ministry of Commerce and was backed by the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Monday said they smashed a fraud syndicate which allegedly made use of deepfake technology to persuade people to invest in cryptocurrency.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said they raided a premises in a Hung Hom industrial building and arrested 27 people, including core syndicate members.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said the total amount of losses exceeded HK$360 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the victims were not only from Hong Kong but also the mainland, Taiwan and Singapore, among other places.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 21 and 34, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and possessing offensive weapon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior superintendent Fang Chi-kin said the syndicate made use of deepfake technology to build relationships online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They got in touch with the victims on social media, and sent them photos generated by AI, shaping a character who had a very appealing appearance, personality, career and academic qualifications," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Men from different regions were among the victims... Although the victims had video calls [with the character], they falsely believed that they were dating a high-quality person."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Fang added that the syndicate hired people with high academic qualifications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The syndicate hired graduates from local universities who majored in digital media, and used them as technology specialists. From our investigation, they also collaborated with overseas fraudsters and IT experts to build a fake cryptocurrency investment platform."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Superintendent Iu Wing-kan said the syndicate had been operating for more than a year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They set up a performance board. The teams and members who successfully fooled the most victims were listed on the board. The one who topped the chart last month gained US$266,000," he said.

    FTU calls for govt to roll out more fast EV chargers

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) on Monday called on the government to increase the number of fast chargers, to encourage motorists to switch to electric vehicles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The federation said it surveyed over 300 electric vehicle users in July and found that about 75 percent relied on public chargers, of which there are around 5,000 in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FTU lawmaker Michael Luk said the majority of government-run chargers have a slow or medium speed and require at least a few hours to fully charge a vehicle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's more appropriate to set up fast chargers at government-run venues. Normally, they are for the public to use, such as when people are going to sports grounds, sports centres or town halls," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They may only stay there for about one to two hours. If there are fast chargers, their vehicle will be fully recharged."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Luk added that the government should provide incentives for petrol stations to set up superchargers.

 The contractor linked to Sunday's fatal accident in Ho Man Tin, has been suspended from bidding for public works projects and has been required to carry out an independent safety audit.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A worker fell to his death at the construction site on Sunday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Development Bureau (DEVB) said the government attaches great importance to construction site safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in buildings category with immediate effect," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the contractor had to demonstrate that it had an effective safety management system before any decision to lift the suspension could be considered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also warned that it could extend the length of the suspension and even remove the contractor's eligibility to bid for public works contracts in future, pending the outcome of an investigation by the Labour Department.

    Govt urged to improve Strive and Rise programme

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Alliance for Children Development Rights on Monday called for measures in the policy address to improve youth upward mobility and address intergenerational poverty.
 <br>
  <br/>
  From August to September, the alliance polled 114 young people aged 12 to 24, with nearly 70 percent coming from families earning less than HK$20,000 a month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thirty percent of them were part of the Strive and Rise Programme, which pairs underprivileged pupils with volunteer mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey found that around 70 percent of youngsters had little confidence in escaping poverty soon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong Man-ling from the alliance urged the government to further improve the one-year mentorship scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I guess the policy has its limitations because the programme only lasts for one year... We also look forward to seeing if the government will have more follow-up programmes after the Strive and Rise scheme ends," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, when graduates join the alumni group, will there just be events? Or will there be ways to keep helping these low-income young people with government resources?"
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Jayden, an 18-year-old university student from a single-parent family, said he hopes the government will provide more support for young people to pursue their dreams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the current government policies don't help us move up in society enough. They [officials] invest relatively little money for people with dreams," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government could start a child development account to help young people save money for future businesses. They should also streamline the application process for self-financed degree programmes," he said.

    DAB launches new office to help talent settle in HK

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The DAB says talent will also seek assistance from its office instead of only heading to relevant government departments. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=1&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774425_1_20241014153654.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB announced on Monday it would set up an office to offer more assistance to talent who have moved to Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Veteran DAB member Starry Lee said the office would also help the city's ambitions to attract more talented professionals from around the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We believe that, as a party in Hong Kong, we have a relatively wide network in our community, we can play a more active role in supporting talent. Therefore, we would like to set up a talent hub, it is a platform, not only an office," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee believes getting the word out about the new office would not be difficult.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Based on my understanding, they have different WeChat groups to exchange information... I believe this information will be easily spread among their group."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the Policy Address on Wednesday, the DAB suggested the government set up a special student visa for the children of those who have come to Hong Kong on various talent schemes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is among the 12 suggestions it made to make the city more attractive for global talent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB said the visas could offer a buffer for children to complete their studies even when their parents fail to get their visas renewed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their children are now in our Hong Kong education system. If you ask a student to leave immediately in the middle of the term, it will not be good for the talent, and it would pass a very bad message to those who want to come to Hong Kong," said Lee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Therefore we would like to suggest at least for that term or if possible, why not for the whole year to let those students to finish their studies, and then their parents can make appropriate decisions to settle their children. Because we all know that whether or not they will stay in Hong Kong, their children's education is one of the very important concerns."

    Panda twins growing up stably: Ocean Park

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park on Monday said its baby twin pandas are now two months old and are growing up stably.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The park said the pair's eyes have fully opened and they have started developing their hearing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the female now weighs 2.7 kg and her brother weighs about 2.5 kg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Howard Chuk, head of the park's zoological operations and conservation, said staff have been sharing the job of looking after the cubs with the pandas' mother, Ying Ying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although we have all the nursery facilities, including the incubator, we try to maximise the opportunities to allow Ying Ying to take care of the cubs. This benefits the behaviour, as well as the health of the cubs," Chuk said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But... we need to ensure Ying Ying is capable, and also we are pretty sure the babies are safe after we return or rotate the cubs back to Ying Ying."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Elke Wu, an assistant curator of zoological operations, said Ying Ying is about 80 percent recovered from giving birth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "She's a first-time mum and she's not young anymore, so her recovery is really slow and she's very picky at her appetite," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our whole husbandry team spends so much time looking for food that she likes, or making food into different forms that she will be willing to take in, and we literally just feed it into her mouth sometimes."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wu said it is still difficult to tell the twins apart but they have different characteristics, with the female having messy fur and the male having rounder dark circles around his eyes.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A participant of the annual Hong Kong Cyclothon on Sunday made waves on social media after he was seen completing the 50km course with a rental bike that anyone can pick up on the city’s streets.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos and videos of the rider putting a Locobike through its paces across Stonecutters Bridge and nearby highways went viral online.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Many cyclists confirmed spotting the rider along the route, adding they were humbled by the light-blue bicycle that was never designed for long-distance riding, let alone competing in races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A real rider does not need top equipment. Does this put some people to shame?" One user wrote on Facebook.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Others suspected it was a publicity stunt, as the man was also seen wearing a jersey bearing Locobike's logo.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the company insisted it had no part to play in the feat and was still "thinking of ways" to reward the rider.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bike-sharing platform also posted a log sheet on Facebook, suggesting the man completed the race in two hours and 28 minutes, translating to an average speed of 20.2km per hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What happened to the bike after the race, as some might wonder?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He took the train and returned the bike safely by locking it," the company revealed.

    HKUST student hall workers owed HK$2m in wages: union

<div class="itemFullText">
 Around 60 builders working on the new student residences at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology are owed two months' wages to the tune of HK$2 million, according to a leading union.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union added around a dozen subcontractors were also seeking more than HK$60 million in project fees from the main contractor, Paul Y. Engineering Group.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A Facebook post showed workers staging a protest at the construction site at the Clearwater Bay campus on Monday morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mr Chau, a union representative, revealed it was not the first time the workers did not receive their wages on time, with construction even halted between May and June this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He told RTHK that workers had demanded school officials resolve the dispute by the end of this week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work is still under way after a new contractor, Hip Hing Construction, took over the project last month, Chau added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to HKUST's website, construction of the HK$1.2 billion development began in 2020, and was supposed to be completed last year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The eight-storey project, designed by renowned architectural firm Zaha Hadid Architects, includes accommodation for 1,500 students, as well as communal amenities and a sport hall.

    Officials probe mystery animal deaths at HK zoo

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government is investigating the deaths of nine monkeys at the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens (HKZBG).
 <br>
  <br/>
  The dead animals were four White-faced Sakis, three Cotton-top Tamarins, one De Brazza’s Monkey and one Common Squirrel Monkey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) said it's liaising with officials from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, and autopsies and other tests are being carried out to determine the cause of death.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the mammals section of the facility in Central was closed from Monday for disinfection.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will also closely monitor the health conditions of other animals," the LCSD said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "During this period, other facilities of the HKZBG will remain open."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung on Monday convened an urgent interdepartmental meeting to discuss the matter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said officials have completed the disinfection and cleaning of animal cages involved, and staff working at the park are in healthy conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said it is uncommon to have multiple animal fatalities within a short time-frame, and an investigation was needed to pinpoint the cause.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It hoped the results could provide clarity and insight into the incident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Florence Tang, from the Chinese University's School of Biomedical Sciences, said there was a low possibility of infectious diseases being spread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the [death of the] monkeys were caused by infectious diseases, there should be an incubation period. During the incubation period, they should show symptoms," she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But there were no signals for those keepers to alert those monkeys were sick. The other monkeys are very happy in the cages."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that some visitors might have fed the monkeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang reminded park visitors to avoid having close contact with animals there, and operators should step up sanitation measures to prevent similar incidents from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Park visitors, meanwhile, were left disappointed with the temporary closure of the mammals section.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man and his granddaughter visited the gardens on Monday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I was a bit disappointed. Of course I think the closure was unfortunate. For us adults, the closure was not a big problem. But for children, they are more interested in the animals and they are more curious," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For me, I am reaching retirement age soon. I just take my granddaughter out to play when I am free."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chhavi and her family came all the way from Australia just to find that the mammals section of the gardens was closed temporarily.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[I] feel a bit disappointed obviously, and it just started from today," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will probably see the birds and whatever we can."

    'Two HK medical schools need to step up training'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau on Sunday called on two medical schools in Hong Kong to step up their training for doctors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lo's remarks came after two blunders involving the incorrect placements of feeding tubes in patients at public hospitals.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Lo said the repeated mishaps involving intern doctors could no longer be viewed as individual cases, but reflected a systemic problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will examine the teaching of the two medical schools, especially in clinical training, to see whether the training for some common medical procedures is adequate. We will communicate with the schools to ensure our graduates are fit to practice," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the health minister said the SAR government has contacted the mainland authorities to look for a life-saving heart transplant for three-month-old baby girl Whitney in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I know mainland authorities have been actively responding to us, but we must understand that there are not many organ donations, especially for a three-month-old baby girl. The donor's body size has to be similar to hers. Due to heart sizes, it is not that easy," Lo added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "However, our country has a population of 1.4 billion. That even makes rare diseases no longer rare. We still hold onto the hope that there could be a miracle to help baby Whitney."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The baby girl is suffering from a condition of an enlarged heart chamber that has affected blood pumping to the rest of the body.

    Look out for thyroid eye disease, experts warn

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Experts say people should keep an eye out for symptoms like double vision, eye discomfort and visual dysfunction. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774308_1_20241013161617.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts have called on people to pay special attention to thyroid eye disease – a disorder that causes inflammation and damage to the tissues around the eye.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The College of Ophthalmologists and the Ophthalmology Society said while the disease is primarily associated with an over-active thyroid gland, it can sometimes occur in patients with an under-active or normally functioning thyroid gland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Kelvin Chong from the College of Opthalmologists said people should keep an eye out for symptoms, such as bulging eyes and double vision, as it is typically harder for Asian patients to identify the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[Patients] of Asian descent, their skin colours are darker, their skin is thicker, and they have a higher pain threshold. Many of the symptoms do not present until there are obvious deformities of the eye, for example, proptosis or double vision,” Chong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Common symptoms include double vision, eye discomfort, visual dysfunction and disfigurement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Doctors added that the disease can cause permanent damage to patients’ eyesight and physical appearance. It may also lead to severe complications like nerve compression, corneal ulcer, and even cause blindness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  High risk groups include men, smokers, people aged 50 or above, those with a stressful lifestyle, as well as patients with thyroid gland disorders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chong said there are different ways to treat the condition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Depending on the stage and the severity, it ranges from medical treatment that modulates the immune functions, all the way to having surgery that expands the socket, realign the eye or eyelid,” he noted.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A 90-year-old man surnamed Chau was diagnosed with thyroid eye disease in mid-2023, after being found to have hyperthyroidism a year ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chau’s son said his father developed symptoms like dry and swollen eyes, and was treated with steroid therapy, radiotherapy, and immunosuppressants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He now feels more confident working in front of the computer, and he’s still writing a book. The appearance of his eyes looked much better and he said his eyes don't feel dry anymore.”

    Chris Froome and Sarah Lee among HK Cyclothon riders

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome and Hong Kong's two-time Olympic medallist Sarah Lee were among those who took part in this year's Hong Kong Cyclothon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 50-kilometre race kicked off in Tsim Sha Tsui at around 5.15am on Sunday, and the route includes Tsing Ma Bridge, Ting Kau Bridge and Stonecutters Bridge, as well as several tunnels.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Froome said he very much enjoyed his first Cyclothon, as the ride in Hong Kong is very different from racing in Europe.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Seeing Hong Kong by bike through all the main roads, it's just such a pleasure. I think these are roads that cyclists would never normally get the chance to enjoy," the British rider said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So to be able to really take in the city, take in the surroundings, yeah, just such an amazing experience."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee, for her part, said while it's her third time taking part in the Cyclothon, this is the first time where she wasn't going for speed and has more time to enjoy the experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think the most beautiful part of the route is the Stonecutters Bridge. Usually you look at the bridge from the pier, you already find it beautiful -- but when you actually ride a bike on the bridge it's a different feeling," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In terms of difficulty, it's really the general situation in Hong Kong, you have to make sharp U-turns in many places [along the route]. If there are earlier traffic signs about them, it'd be better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Organisers said a record 6,000 people joined this year's Cyclothon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As part of the event, the Tourism Board also hosted a sports carnival at the West Kowloon Cultural District, with local food stalls, yoga sessions and freestyle cycling performances all part of the programme.

File Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774282_1_20241013121030.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Alliance for Advocacy Against Alcohol on Sunday urged the government not to cut spirits tax, saying it would pose a significant public health risk.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Industry representatives earlier urged the administration to consider slashing duties from the current 100 percent to 20 percent to stimulate the market and boost sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the group’s honorary secretary, Regina Ching, said over 3.7 million people die each year around the world because of alcohol, noting that alcohol is linked to over 200 diseases and injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're really very concerned, especially in the healthcare sector. That's because spirits have a very high alcohol concentration. For example, even if you drink a small amount of spirits, the alcohol concentration is the equivalent of drinking several cans of beer,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ching, who’s also a former assistant director of health, warned that young people may be tempted to try strong alcohol if the price is lowered.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That's very dangerous. It's simple - when things are cheaper, people tend to buy more. It's particularly concerning for those who should be more protected—the young people—who are more sensitive to the prices of alcoholic products. Therefore, if you reduce the prices, they will be tempted to try it,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted that the government had formulated the Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in 2018, with the aim of significantly reducing the rate of alcohol consumption by next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government should fully implement its policies related to alcohol control, including raising alcohol taxes, limiting sales and enhancing promotion for non-drinking, if it still aims to reach this goal, she stressed.

    Changes to CEPA would boost HK's competitiveness: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday hailed recent amendments to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) as a significant enhancement to Hong Kong’s competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The changes to the free trade agreement, signed by the SAR government and the Ministry of Commerce last week, are set to take effect from March 1 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The recent amendments to the CEPA will significantly lower entry barriers to the mainland for Hong Kong enterprises and relax qualification requirements in sectors such as finance and legal arbitration,” Chan wrote on his weekly blog.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This is expected to attract more foreign companies and professional service firms to use Hong Kong as a base for entering the mainland market.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance chief also revealed that as of early October, over 48,000 applications have been submitted for a new travel permit which allows non-Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents to travel to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the National Immigration Administration, around 16,000 such permits have been issued so far.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The travel document, rolled out in July, allows permit holders to enter the mainland multiple times within a five-year validity period, with each stay not exceeding 90 days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Providing easier entry for non-Chinese permanent residents of Hong Kong will encourage more overseas individuals to choose Hong Kong as their place of residence, facilitating their access to the mainland,” Chan said.

 Executive councillor Jeffrey Lam on Saturday said Hong Kong's economy now is at its best for five years, but warned the government against lowering its guard.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Lam said many factors had helped the city's economy in recent months, including the start of the US Federal Reserve interest rate easing cycle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he noted that the SAR should not only rely on external factors, as he urged the authorities to further roll out favourable policies to stimulate the economy when the Chief Executive delivers his Policy Address next Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are talking a lot about how to attract talent and investment into Hong Kong, so policy is one thing that will attract talent and investments to come to Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When investment comes to Hong Kong for the first time, we need some efficient policies to help them to get settled in Hong Kong. I think efficient and maybe a one-stop office should be set up as soon as possible to help the foreign investors to do everything within one office in one day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong and mainland earlier signed an agreement to amend the CEPA framework on trade in services, and changes will take effect from March 1 next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another member of the Executive Council, Chan Kin-por, said the arrangement would lower the threshold and reduce qualification requirements, allowing Hong Kong firms to enter the mainland market much more easily, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.

 Police on Friday said five firefighters were injured after a van collided with a fire truck in Tseung Kwan O.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fire truck was passing by Clear Water Bay Road in the morning, when a wild boar suddenly jumped into traffic and was hit by a private car, which killed the animal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The fire truck then made a stop to alert other vehicles, but a van failed to stop in time and collided with the fire truck, injuring five firefighters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were sent to the United Christian Hospital.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong residents flocked to the mainland on Friday for the Chung Yeung Festival long weekend holiday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  RTHK spoke to some residents queuing for a bus to Heung Yuen Wai Control Point at Fanling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will explore around Liantang, just to walk around, and I will return today," a man surnamed Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, a woman surnamed Yip said she travels to Shenzhen every month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am going to Shenzhen to have fun, maybe I'll get hotpot. I'm heading there because it's a holiday today, and my mom is with me. I want to relax myself, because I always stay in Hong Kong. I want to go to other places and walk around."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Special transport arrangements were made to accommodate travellers. The transport department said the vehicle clearance plaza towards Zhuhai direction at Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge remained busy, and waiting times for the shuttle bus were extended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department reminded residents travelling to Zhuhai or Macau to plan ahead and allow more time for journeys.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At West Kowloon station, announcements were made to remind the public to leave sufficient time to complete immigration procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police earlier called on the public to make use of different ports to enter the mainland, as waiting times for cars to cross the border at Shenzhen Bay Port may exceed one hour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  MTR said train services will be strengthened during the long weekend period, with waiting times shortened on the East Rail Line and Island Line.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Immigration Department, more than 570,000 people left the city on Thursday, which was more than 1.5 times the number the day before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the people who made their departures, around 480,000 of them were Hong Kong residents.

    Asian Dragon Boat Championships returns to HK

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The 15th Asian Dragon Boat Championships on Friday made its splash in Hong Kong, returning to the SAR after 28 years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Staged at the Kwun Tong Promenade, the three-day event has drawn 800 participants from 13 countries and regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arnold Chung, chairman of the event organiser - Hong Kong China Dragon Boat Association - said with its deep water level, calm waters, and long coastline, the venue meets international standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe during the event, it can also boost the economy of east Kowloon. Because from our findings, all six hotels in the Kwun Tong districts are already fully booked. It can also help the catering sector be more vibrant," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung hopes the event will act as a pilot run for the World Dragon Boat Racing Championships 2027.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At that event, the city will roll out the carpet for 3,500 participants. Chung believes it can offer a bigger boost to the economy and lure tourists from the Greater Bay Area and around the world.

    Three-month-old girl needs urgent heart transplant: HA

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority said a 3-month-old baby girl is in need of a life-saving heart transplant after developing a condition of an enlarged heart chamber that has affected blood pumping to the rest of her body.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Authority has urged the public to actively support organ donations and consider donating the heart of deceased relatives to give new life to others.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It made the call on Friday after the baby, named Whitney, is said to be in critical condition at the paediatric intensive care unit of the Hong Kong Children's Hospital in Kowloon Bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suffers from dilated cardiomyopathy - a heart muscle disease that causes the heart to be unable to pump enough blood due to a weakened heart muscle.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The infant is relying on a ventilator machine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She is now at the top of a heart transplant waiting list for patients of similar body size, that weigh 6kg to 18kg. Even though it hopes to look for donor with blood type B+ or O+, the authority said other blood types are also suitable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesperson in a statement added that it will seek help from the mainland as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When a patient willing to donate an organ has passed away and no suitable patient is identified on the Mainland, the cross-boundary organ donation and matching mechanism will facilitate a transplant in Hong Kong to bring hope to a critically ill patient."

    'Plain-clothes security can only use minimum force'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Police have classified the case as common assault after a woman was allegedly grabbed by the neck by two plain-clothes security guards in Tsim Sha Tsui. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1774095_1_20241011130023.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A former director from a security workers union said on Friday that plain-clothes security guards should only use minimum force when it comes to making legal arrests.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The comment came after a woman said on social media she was accused of theft at a Mannings branch in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She wrote in the post that she paid for the two boxes of cough syrup at a self-checkout counter, but was allegedly grabbed by the neck by two plain-clothes guards and dragged back into the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The store apologised to the woman in a statement, saying that the guards from a third-party company had been fired.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It had also ended the contract with the security company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The police have received the report filed by the woman. The case has now been classified as common assault.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Kevlin Yuen, former director of the Hong Kong Buildings Management and Security Workers General Union, pointed out that both plain-clothes and ordinary security guards require the same kind of licence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said uniformed security guards aim to prevent crimes, while plain-clothes guards aim to not let people discover their existence, unless there is a case of theft.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen, who's also a security trainer, emphasised that plain-clothes guards can only perform their duty of stopping suspects after they leave the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They then have to identify themselves, before asking for receipts from the suspects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only if the suspects try to run away can the guards chase after them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In theory, plain-clothes security guards can only use the minimum force necessary to achieve the aim of arresting suspects - which is not to let them run away," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You don't have to grab the person by the neck or drag them back to the store. You don't have to confine or lock the person up."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen also said once the suspects give up trying to flee the scene, guards have to stop using force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the same programme, lawmaker Peter Shiu from the wholesale and retail sector emphasised that guards could be at risk of breaking the law if they use excessive force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He quoted reports from the Security Bureau, saying that shoplifting cases have increased in the past six months, especially with the availability of self check-out kiosks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiu said once the guards suspect customers of theft, they should report to the police immediately.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their role is supposed to stop such a situation. If they have to use force, they should be careful. Because they should call the police at once when they suspect a customer of shoplifting," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they have to stop the suspect, they should only use appropriate force. If their use of force exceeds a certain level, they might be at risk of breaking the law."

    HKU plans to increase student diversity

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Thursday said it will continue to work on increasing the diversity of its students and enhancing the balance of students from different countries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The university said there were about 1,200 newly admitted non-local students this year, higher than the 900 recorded last year. About half of the non-local students were from the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Professor Bennett Yim, director of undergraduate admissions and international student exchange, said there were fewer applications from Europe and North America than other regions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Mainland students, being much closer to Hong Kong, they will have a much better understanding of the University of Hong Kong, [about] what we can offer. I think it's not surprising to see that quite a lot of our students are actually coming from mainland China," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our goal is always to continue to increase the diversity. And so right now, we are putting a lot of effort, going to everywhere in the world to try to promote Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about instances of students securing their admission to HKU with fake degrees, vice-president Ian Holliday said he is not worried that similar situations will happen again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We now have very robust procedures for identifying fake qualifications. We know what to look for in URLs. We know what to look for in terms of certificates that are sent to us," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have a team of kind of forensic experts who are confident in unearthing any of the questionable qualifications that we receive. We feel that every student that we ultimately do admit to HKU does merit, does deserve a place here."

    'Medical intern training needs to be strengthened'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A legislator and a patients' rights advocate on Friday said there is a need to enhance the training for doctors following a medical error at Pamela Youde Eastern Hospital.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It came a day after the Hospital Authority said it will deliver a report within eight weeks, after a houseman wrongly placed a feeding tube into the lung of a 76-year-old patient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient ended up in intensive care after medication was delivered through the tube into his lung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK radio programme, Tim Pang, an advocate for patients' rights from the Society for Community Organisation, said the incident is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking at the results, it is definitely unacceptable. However, considering the situation, it can be understood. We should not blame this houseman too much. Of course, this incident also reflects a need to strengthen the training at medical school," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Or, when housemen enter a new work environment, they may need to be given sufficient basic information beforehand to get more experience."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident followed a similar blunder in June, when medical staff inserted a tube into the airway of a 61-year-old man at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Medical sector lawmaker, Dr David Lam, said authorities have to review the training for doctors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have two incidents in a short period of time that indicates seriously that there is a fault either in the training or in the system," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, I would think it is reasonable to put a stop to that and require all medical officers to see the x-ray films for an isometric tube intubation before further orders are made. That should be the new norm until we can be certain that effective training for interns is in place."

 A lawmaker on Friday called for banks to provide as much financial assistance as possible to small and medium sized enterprises while maintaining the stability of Hong Kong's financial system.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the banking industry met with the business sector earlier to understand the situations businesses face when fundraising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Peter Shiu said businesses are finding it more difficult to raise capital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Previously, if some companies had projects in mind and talked to the banks about borrowing money, the banks were very willing to lend them money. But nowadays, the banks are less willing to lend money. I believe during the approval process, banks take more time and ask businesses more questions," Shiu said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I understand that Hong Kong is now in its economic transformation period. A lot of industries are not meeting their expected performance targets after the pandemic, and the global economy is slow. I hope banks can help businesses in a more humane way," he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shiu also said the earlier situation of businesses having their loans called in and their credit limits reduced had improved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some companies took out a mortgage, or used some of their credit, but then property prices dropped these past few years, and the companies were required to bring more money to the bank or have their credit limits cut, or even being asked to take out another mortgage so they could continue to borrow from banks," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that another meeting with the banking industry will be held later this month, in the hope of discuss more ways to help the business sector.

    Feeding tube wrongly inserted at Eastern Hospital

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority on Thursday said a houseman at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital mistakenly inserted a feeding tube into a patient's bronchus.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The authority said medical staff injected the medication via the tube into the lung of the 76-year-old man on Wednesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The patient was later sent to the intensive care unit and his condition is now stable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the hospital, the chief executive of the Hong Kong East Cluster, Loletta So, said the houseman might have misread the X-ray image due to a lack of clinical experience.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So said the authority has formed a committee to investigate the incident and it will deliver a report within eight weeks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have met with the patient's family to explain the incident. We have extended our heartfelt apologies to them. Our medical team will closely monitor the patient's condition and provide the necessary treatment. We are committed to supporting the family, and we hope that the patient will recover soon," she added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The incident follows a similar blunder in June, when medical staff inserted a feeding tube into the airway of a 61-year-old male patient at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

    'National Day discounts bring crowds for businesses’

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Discounts offered during National Day enticed customers to spend and dine out, catering and retail industry leaders said on Thursday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They also said their business boomed during the October 1 holiday period, with some reporting a double-digit rise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nearly 3,700 restaurants, stores, supermarkets and hotels dished out promotions to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In my best dreams, I couldn’t dream that we have this result this year, compared to what we did last year. This is more than I have expected,” said lawmaker Tommy Cheung.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I haven’t heard any complaints, which is rare. Everybody that went [out to dine] said even though they had a line of 30 minutes, people still thought it’s worth to wait in line.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the trade was planning to roll out similar discounts again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We’re aiming to have more other sectors and aiming [for] more outlets, and obviously within these outlets, we’re aiming to have more items where they could do 30 percent off,” Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are not planning anything other than July 1 and October 1 yet. As we say all along, we are doing this to celebrate July 1 and October 1.”

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Customs officers on Thursday said they had arrested a 35-year-old woman who is suspected of smuggling a tonne of agarwood into Hong Kong from Nansha.
 <br>
  <br/>
  It was the largest seizure of agarwood in history and the first case of smuggling the product by sea, Customs officers told a joint press conference with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they seized the endangered species in a 20-foot container at the Tuen Mun River Trade Terminal, with a market value of around HK$18 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, we noticed that agarwood is a kind of very rare wood, and its demand is very high and its value is very high," said Lau Yuk-lung, an acting senior superintendent with customs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It can be used to produce different kinds of products like essential oil, some ornaments or decorations, so it has been used by different criminals for making profits."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the AFCD said it would step up inspections at border checkpoints to combat the smuggling of agarwood.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We also conduct regular education campaigns to educate the public about the regulation of agarwood and other endangered species," said the AFCD's endangered species protection officer Chan Hon-ki.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that agarwood is protected under Hong Kong law and trees are often illegally cut down due to their high value and demand.

    Govt urged to halt Green Form subsidised homes scheme
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors is calling on the government to suspend the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme, saying doing so would allow resources to be allocated to those most in need.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Under the scheme, public housing tenants and other eligible people can buy flats at prices lower than other subsidised units.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But on an RTHK radio programme on Thursday, institute chairman Francis Lam said these Green Form units should instead be used as public rental flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the government will need to find temporary homes for people in subdivided units that are found to be unfit for living in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is also related to the government's plan for tackling the issue of subdivided flats. If it sets minimum standards for size, construction, hygiene and fire safety, there will be tens of thousands, or at least 10,000 to 20,000, subdivided flats that fall below standards that will have to be vacated temporarily for renovation," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Tenants who are affected have to be housed, we cannot let them be homeless. Therefore, the demand for public housing units will only be greater and more pressing."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The call to suspend the Green Form scheme is among the institute's proposals for Chief Executive John Lee ahead of his policy address on October 16.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute is also suggesting the government review its policy of allowing subsidised homes to be sold on the open market if the seller first pays a premium to the Housing Authority.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Castle Peak Hospital has unveiled a board game designed to help children who were reluctant to seek help from adults with their emotional and mental health concerns.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The game was distributed to about 500 secondary schools in Hong Kong and was designed to enhance students' knowledge of mental health issues while giving them the skills to deal with different emotions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jessica Wong from the hospital's institute of mental health said the kit was different from other materials for schools.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Most of the teaching materials are for the teachers and social workers to apply to the students, whereas our kit is for students to use themselves. Even when students are not willing to speak up, they could at least have some skills," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Inside the kit, there is information available, for instance, the website of 'Shall We Talk'. That contains many information, including online psychological support, so students could have access to this information, even when they are not willing to talk to the teachers about it."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that social workers and teachers could help identify students who might benefit from the game.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Mannings on Wednesday said it is highly concerned about an incident where a customer was believed to be wrongly accused of theft and mistreated by security guards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a social media post on Tuesday, a woman said she was accused of theft after buying two boxes of cough syrup at a Mannings branch in Tsim Sha Tsui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the post, she paid for the items at a self-checkout counter, but was allegedly grabbed by the neck by two plain clothes security guards and dragged back into the store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Mannings apologised to the customer and said the security guards were from a third-party company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chain store said the guards had been fired and that it had ended its contract with the security company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At the same time, we have established a task force to follow up on the incident, including reviewing store security and related processes to prevent similar incidents from happening again," the statement read.

 Police say they will close some major roads on Sunday for the Hong Kong Cyclothon.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The race routes will cover thoroughfares including Canton Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, West Kowloon Highway and the Tsing Ma Bridge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Various roads will be shut in phases from 1am, with some expected to remain closed to traffic until around 3.30pm.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Event organisers say some 6,000 cyclists will take part.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We'll hold the first Cyclothon Carnival at the West Kowloon Cultural District. To cope with this new carnival, the finishing line will be on the bridge above Jordan Road. Cyclists can go to the carnival right away," Raymond Chan, general manager of event and product development at the Tourism Board told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan also said the 50-kilometre race will feature retired cyclists Lee Wai-sze and Wong Kam-po, while fencer Yeung Chi-ka will join the 32-kilometre race.

    SAR, Commerce Ministry sign amendment to CEPA

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Paul Chan (centre) says the CEPA amendment will make it easier for local professionals to tap into the mainland market. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=75&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1773830_1_20241009165900.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Local enterprises and professionals will be able to access mainland markets more easily thanks to the latest amendment to the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  He made the comment after the SAR government and the Ministry of Commerce signed an agreement to amend the CEPA framework on trade in services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The free trade agreement, first signed between the SAR and the mainland in 2003, allows qualifying Hong Kong companies and residents to enjoy preferential access to the mainland market.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The changes, which will take effect from March 1 next year, include removing or loosening restrictions on business scope in setting up enterprises, and relaxing qualification requirements for professionals from certain sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm sure for the professional sectors, people are very keen to expand their foothold into the mainland by using the Greater Bay Area as the starting point. So this will be a very positive impact on Hong Kong," Chan told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the relaxation agreement, there are certain industries directly benefiting, including the testing and certification sector, telecommunications, filming, television, financial services, and tourism."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Under the amendment, local surveying enterprises will be allowed to provide services in Guangdong province through the filing of records, and Hong Kong telecom service suppliers can sell international phone cards which cannot be activated in the mainland across the border.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For tourism, the 144-hour visa-exemption policy for foreign tour groups entering Guangdong from Hong Kong will be optimised.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In banking, foreign bank branches set up by Hong Kong companies will be allowed to offer bank card services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the recent fluctuations in the stock market, Chan said the financial market is affected by many factors including external interest rates, adding that investors should manage risks carefully.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A construction workers union on Wednesday said there has been a sharp drop in private sector building projects and the government should take up the slack.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Construction Industry Employees General Union said local construction workers fear for their jobs, and salary freezes are widespread.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union said it recently polled over 2,000 members and 35 percent of respondents reported being underemployed. Over 70 percent rated employment prospects this year as being worse than last year.

  The union's chairman, Chau Sze-kit, said the industry is facing challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The number of private sector construction projects has fallen. Although the number of government projects remains unchanged, the amount of construction expenditure in both markets is half-half. Last year project volumes were already down, but this year they have decreased by two-thirds," Chau said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have architects and engineers who have seen cuts to their salaries or who have been made redundant, meaning even those higher up in the construction industry are being affected. If they have nothing to do, the prospect for construction workers will also not be good in the coming one to two years."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 80 percent of workers surveyed said the government's labour importation scheme has led to unemployment and a reduction in salaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union urged the government to roll out public work projects, expedite the implementation of redevelopment and maintenance projects to boost job openings in the short term, and make timely adjustments to the labour importation scheme to protect local workers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union also said it has received dozens of requests for assistance regarding monetary disputes, involving hundreds of workers. The complaints mainly involve holiday rights and unpaid wages, the union said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that since July this year, it has handled around 20 cases of unpaid wages caused by a major contractor owing payments to a subcontractor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The union urged the Legislative Council to quickly pass the Construction Industry Security of Payment Bill to protect workers, saying a dispute can take around 1.5 years to be settled at the Labour Tribunal.

 Customs officers on Wednesday said they had arrested three people aged between 44 and 55 last month after finding more than HK$130 million worth of suspected cannabis buds inside a shipment of soya beans at Kwai Chung Customhouse.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They said the consignment from Canada contained about 500 kilos of the drug.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The drugs were hidden in 83 packs of soya beans among 500 packs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers intercepted the shipment when it arrived in the city on September 27, with the sender claiming it was a garment company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the syndicates placed the dugs at the bottom of the cargo and used large amounts of soya bean packets to conceal the narcotics and avoid custom checks.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A man who went to the customhouse to retrieve the shipment on the day was arrested.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This was followed by the arrest of a man and a woman, both of whom were a staff member of a local delivery company.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said investigations were still ongoing and more arrests may be made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The department's senior investigator Tom Cheung said up until September this year, cases involving cannabis had already surpassed last year's total.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As of September this year, Hong Kong customs has seized more than 2,600 kilogrammes of cannabis buds, which is already more than the total number last year," Cheung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the effective enforcement actions taken, the supply of cannabis buds in the market has been decreasing, and at the same time, the price of the drug has been increasing by more than 30 percent in the past few months," he added.
