<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's first batch of light public housing (LPH) will open for applications from June 24, with 4,400 units available in Yuen Long and Ngau Tau Kok.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The idea of modular units for people waiting for public housing was introduced during Chief Executive John Lee's policy address in 2022.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters following a media visit to the flats, Secretary for Housing Winnie Ho said it showed the government's determination in addressing the city's housing crisis.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is only the first batch. Our target is to provide 30,000 light public housing units by the years 2026 and 2027. All the projects are in full speed. All the projects are being pushed forward on the site," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Monthly rent for the flats range from HK$740 to HK$2,650, and tenants were expected to move in as early as the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ho said priority would be given to families living in poor conditions, based on a points system, adding that people in urgent need were encouraged to submit their applications before July 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example families with young children... Many organisations tell us that the changes that can bring to these families are really remarkable and very obvious," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because children when they grow up, like from four years old to 10 years old, this is a very critical period. These five years if you leave them in sub-divided units in such a poor condition, it really affects their learning, their growing up and their social abilities."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The housing minister added that people with disabilities, families with infants and the elderly, and those who choose remote LPH sites, would also be given extra marks under the points system.

    CLP urged to explain recent power outages

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A faulty cable cut power to parts of Wong Tai Sin on Wednesday evening.  File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757275_1_20240613152106.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers have called on CLP to give the public an explanation regarding recent power outages in the city, after over 2,200 customers in Wong Tai Sin were left without power for around four hours on Wednesday evening.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The power company says the latest blackout was caused by a faulty cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman who lives in Lung Kwong House said she struggled with the heat when her air conditioning went off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to turn on two portable fans. It lasted for four hours. I was feeling so hot. I haven't experienced such a situation since I lived here," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another resident said he couldn't understand why the power company did not activate a backup system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I had to walk all the way up to my flat. There was no electricity, no air conditioning, and the food inside my refrigerator turned bad," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said there have been multiple power outages in the city in recent months and this is unacceptable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I expect the government to try to intervene in the situation and ask the company [CLP] to give us the full report on how to, in the long term, make the power supply become more stable," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are not looking into an individual incident. We are looking at a full picture, whether they need some fundamental changes or essential improvements, so that we can guarantee the power supply is stable."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Lau, who chair's Legco's panel on environmental affairs, said the threshold in the current penalty system for power companies is too high.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said CLP would face a penalty of HK$20 million if it recorded 15 million minutes of power disruption to its customers in a year. Wednesday night's outage would have caused around one million minutes of disruption, he added.

    Lawmakers welcome East Kowloon transit system plan

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The smart and green mass transit system will have eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East. Photo courtesy of the Transport and Logistics Bureau" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757264_1_20240613134659.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmakers on Thursday welcomed a proposal for an elevated mass transit system in East Kowloon, with the project expected to be completed in 2033.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Transport and Logistics Bureau submitted a proposal to the Legislative Council on Wednesday to build a seven-kilometre-long system in the area, which would include six kilometres of viaducts and one kilometre of tunnel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The smart and green mass transit system would mainly operate on an elevated corridor, and there would be eight stations between Choi Hung East and Yau Tong East.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Bill Tang, who represents the Kowloon East Constituency, said the elevated mass transit system could solve traffic congestion in the area.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is a very, very significant step that the government has already made a decision to satisfy our Kowloon East residents' long-term request to improve our traffic needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan said the network needed to be fully integrated into the areas it served.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government must ensure that each station is well connected with the residents, including setting up multiple different entries and also the interconnection system with the related housing estates," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said pedestrian facilities would be built to link the existing Choi Hung MTR Station with the proposed Choi Hung East Station, and Yau Tong MTR Station with the proposed Yau Tong East Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The project is expected to be completed in 2033, but Ngan hopes the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government should also look into possibilities of linking the system up with the Kai Tak area, such as Tsz Wan Shan and Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities would seek about HK$262.5 million of funding approval from Legco’s public works subcommittee next Wednesday.

    Hydrogen development plan to be unveiled next week: CE

    <![CDATA[<img alt="John Lee told lawmakers that the government's hydrogen development strategy will be unveiled next week." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757256_1_20240613130238.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that officials will role out a development strategy on hydrogen next week, involving the development of hydrogen energy and vehicles powered by the gas.
 <br>
  <br/>
  During a question and answer session in Legco on the country's initiatives to develop new quality productive forces, Lee said the Environment and Ecology Bureau will announce its hydrogen plan on June 17.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said some laws may have to be changed to allow the safe storage and maintenance of the gas, which is easily combustible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said the government will look into new facilities such as hydrogen gas stations, and officials have already approved several pilot schemes involving hydrogen-powered vehicles.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We already have [hydrogen fuel cell, HFC] buses on trial now running on the streets, and you will also be seeing the launch of several other projects," the CE said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, we have plans to launch a trial project on HFC street washing vehicles, refuse collection vehicles and trams and so on. There will be trial projects too using hydrogen energy."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive also said the government is facing problems developing a "low-altitude economy", which is currently popular on the mainland, noting that the SAR is filled with high-rise buildings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The DAB's Elizabeth Quat said there are several things Hong Kong can look into, such as helicopter transit services from the airport directly to business buildings in the Greater Bay Area, local food delivery with drones, and low-flying air tours for travellers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the legislature also discussed the development of cultural tourism in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Councillor Kenneth Lau, who heads the Heung Yee Kuk, proposed that the government give more funding to rural committees to promote rural cultural activities to tourists, as in-depth cultural tours are becoming more popular.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee agreed that rural representatives know how to design travel itineraries, and government sponsorship would depend on particular projects.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For his part, lawmaker Gary Zhang, who used to work at the MTR Corporation, said there are many transport enthusiasts in the Greater Bay Area interested in the local transport culture.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He called on the authorities to build an extra rail line connecting the planned Hung Shui Kiu Station with Sunny Bay and the Airport Express, so that travellers can get to Lantau and the airport easier.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said he agreed with connecting the Airport Express to more lines, saying officials will seriously look into whether this would be feasible.

    Green Earth calls for more composting capacity

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Founder Edwin Lau quoted current daily composting capacity at being about a fifth of what was required. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757223_1_20240613111509.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The founder of environmental group Green Earth, Edwin Lau, has welcomed the government's plan to have a food waste recycling bin for each and every public housing block within two years but he says there is still room to expand the composting of waste once it is collected.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Lau said government data from 2022 pointed to Hong Kong's daily food waste disposal at being over 3,300 metric tonnes but that current composting capacity was less than 20 percent of that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "You need to match both the total amount of food waste collected from the housing estates and also, at the back end, all the facilities or the food waste composting system," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said the Organic Resources Recovery Centre at Siu Ho Wan in North Lantau, known as O-Park 1, was currently up and running and that O-Park 2 at Sha Ling in North District was undergoing trial runs before being operational later this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These two added together will be 500 tonnes of food waste capacity per day. And, besides these two, there are two sewage co-digestion plants operating, that all together total 100 tonnes per day capacity. So you add up all these four facilities and there is a maximum of 600 tonnes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lau said he thought the government had most likely done the calculation to match the front-end and the back-end to prevent any kind of bottle-neck from happening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Currently, around 90 percent of public estates share some 700 smart recycling bins, and every estate will have at least one bin by next month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Environment minister Tse Chin-wan told lawmakers on Wednesday that the plan was to match the number of blocks with the same amount of bins within two years. Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year and that more bins would be added to estates where there was strong demand.

Photo:" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757214_1_20240613095143.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Engineering professor and lawmaker William Wong says one of the reasons The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC) chose start-up "SmartMore" for its inaugural investment was its plan to base future research in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "Apart from the financial return, part of it is the promise to create more positions for researchers. The Smart-More company promised to actually establish an research centre, an AI research centre, in Hong Kong and all these things are actually favourable to Hong Kong developing into an international information technology hub," Wong said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government investment vehicle and SmartMore signed a cooperation deal on Wednesday. The company is involved in artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKIC's CEO Clara Chan has said there will be different investment themes with AI in June, life sciences in July, and new energy technology in August. Professor Wong, who is the associate dean of the Faculty of Engineering at the Chinese University, was also asked for his views on these investment themes and whether they would suit Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From this particular case, you can see the government is working very hard step by step... to satisfy the KPIs," he said referring to the investment term 'Key Performance Indicator'.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, the Financial Secretary Paul Chan hailed the partnership between the government-owned investment vehicle and the local tech unicorn, saying it would help boost Hong Kong's innovation and technology industry.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Parts of Wong Tai Sin plunged into darkness for four hours on Wednesday evening, with CLP saying a faulty cable was to blame for cutting off power to more than 2,200 customers..
 <br>
  <br/>
  Photos on social media showed a number of residential buildings and shopping malls were affected by the blackout at around 8pm. Power was eventually restored shortly after midnight. Temple Mall North, Lower Wong Tai Sin Estate and Mei Tung Estate were among the areas affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, the government said it was very concerned about the outage. "Residents were trapped in lifts and might have an uncomfortable night under this hot weather," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Emergency shelters were set up at Tung Tau Community Centre and Wong Tai Sin Community Centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to the Fire Services Department, there were at least four reports of people trapped in lifts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CLP said the power outage was caused by a malfunction in an 11,000-volt cable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The power firm apologised to those affected, adding that urgent repair work was being carried out, with emergency generators taken to the site.

    Show of force necessary for absconders: Regina Ip

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Lawmaker Regina Ip backed the government's move to impose sanctions against six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences, saying it was necessary to demonstrate to the public that there are consequences for breaking the law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I doubt very much whether these absconders will actually come back to Hong Kong to face the law," the former security minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But it will demonstrate to any potential absconders that the government takes absconding highly seriously, and there are punitive measures directed against them if they do run away from the law."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another former security chief-turned-lawmaker, Lai Tung-kwok, said the purpose of revoking the fugitives' passports was to limit their mobility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But he admitted they could still visit countries using other travel documents, such as a British National (Overseas) passport which is not recognised in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, barrister and Executive Councillor Ronny Tong warned that anyone who joins paid subscriptions of websites or channels run by the six persons may be seen as providing financial aid to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said people may still fall foul of the law by simply "following" such pages, as this may indirectly help the wanted persons generate revenue through advertisements.

 Education minister Christine Choi on Wednesday said a government taskforce set up to look into a  public spat involving top management at the University of Hong Kong will help with internal communication, rather than investigating specific incidents.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang and the head of the university's governing council, Priscilla Wong, have been in conflict over senior appointments and management issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government on Tuesday announced the formation of the taskforce, comprising of Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li and head of the University Grants Council Tim Lui. It said their role will include coordinating cooperation and communication within HKU.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi said the pair will contact or meet people involved in the matter, to find out more about the issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The group doesn't have a timetable...we hope to gradually show results to the public in the process," she told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The aim is not just to come up with a written report on the matter, we want to play an actual role."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Environment minister Tse Chin-wan on Wednesday said he expects each public housing block to have a food waste recycling bin within two years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking to lawmakers at a Legco meeting, he said about 700 smart recycling bins for food waste were installed at about 90 percent of public estates across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He expects the smart recycling bins would be installed at all public estates in Hong Kong by next month, which was a month ahead of the original schedule.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added more bins would be installed at public estates, with the goal of installing a bin at each public housing block within two years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But lawmakers questioned if the process could be shortened.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some old residents told me that there are 11 blocks in their estate, with 380 units, but there are only three food waste smart recycling bins in the whole estate... Can we expedite the process and have one bin in each block within one year?" lawmaker Kitson Yang asked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse said discussions would be made with the Housing Authority.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will see which residential buildings have higher usage of food waste smart recycling bins, and we will install more bins at those estates with higher usage. We will also replace the inner bins of the recycling bins more often to enhance its capacity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tse added that more than 400 smart recycling bins for food waste would be put into service at private housing estates in this financial year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 An insider trading case against Asian hedge fund Segantii Capital Management, its British founder Simon Sadler and a former trader has been moved to the District Court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Eastern Magistrates' Court approved the prosecution’s request to transfer the case to a higher court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The next hearing is scheduled to take place at the District Court on July 2, the court ruled.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum prison term a district court judge can impose is seven years, versus two to three years for the magistrate's court.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The case marks a turning point for one of Asia's biggest and oldest hedge funds as well as a step toward heightened scrutiny of trading activities in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said last month it had started criminal proceedings against Segantii, its founder and chief investment officer Sadler and former trader Daniel La Rocca on suspicion of insider dealing in the shares of a Hong Kong-listed company before a block trade in June 2017.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The accusation relates to insider information about Hong Kong-listed fashion chain Esprit Holdings, the court readout revealed, adding Segantii received the information from Tony Psarianos, a person connected to Esprit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Psarianos was an investment banker at Merrill Lynch from 2007 to 2021, according to SFC licence records.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sadler, dubbed Asia's "block trade king", is also the owner of his home-town soccer team, Blackpool Football Club. (Reuters)

    Woman loses final appeal over Quarry Bay shootings

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong's top court has dismissed an appeal by a woman who was jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle and wounding two other relatives. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757064_1_20240612115331.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A woman jailed for life for shooting dead her aunt and uncle lost her final appeal against her convictions for murder on Wednesday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former bodyguard Tsim Sum-kit also shot and wounded two other relatives in the attack in Quarry Bay Park in 2018, following a family lunch to discuss dividing up the estate of her late grandmother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a High Court trial in 2021, the defence failed to the convince the jury that Tsim had suffered from an abnormality of the mind which resulted in an impairment of mental responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In her latest appeal, Tsim argued that the legal requirement for a defendant to prove they suffer from diminished responsibility – if this is to be used as a partial defence to murder – infringes upon the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But in a written judgement, a panel of five Court of Final Appeal judges said the question of diminished responsibility does not affect the presumption of innocence as it is not an ingredient of the offence a defendant is charged with, but an extenuating mitigating circumstance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said diminished responsibility is a factor that only comes into play if and when prosecutors have proven a defendant's guilt.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The partial defence of diminished responsibility does not in any way reduce the burden on the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence of murder," the judges said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is only when a defendant is prima facie guilty of murder that the plea of diminished responsibility becomes relevant. If the prosecution has not already discharged the onus of proving the actus reus and mens rea of murder, the defendant will be entitled to an outright acquittal on the charge of murder and the plea of diminished responsibility will have no further relevance."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsim had also asked the court to consider whether the requirement under the Homicide Ordinance for the defence to prove diminished responsibility is proportionate and justified, or whether offering some evidence to support the claim ought to be enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On this point, the judges said the ordinance has "the legitimate aim of alleviating the prosecution from an unworkable burden arising from the practical difficulties of proving a matter so personal to the accused".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They added that a number of factors support this conclusion, including "the fact mental disorders and their effects are not part of ordinary life experience of a jury [and] the fact an accused cannot be compelled to be subject to medical examination by the prosecution."

    CUHK unveils novel bladder cancer surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Dr Jeremy Teoh (seated) says the new surgery technique can remove the whole tumour in one piece rather than fragmenting it, reducing the chance of the cancer returning.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Chinese University’s Faculty of Medicine on Wednesday said it had identified a new surgery technique that was better at preventing bladder cancer from recurring in patients compared with traditional procedures.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Three hundred and fifty bladder cancer patients participated in the clinical trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Half of them underwent a new surgery technique called en bloc resection of bladder tumour (ERBT) and the other half underwent traditional procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Jeremy Teoh, who led the research, noted that the one-year cancer recurrence rate for patients who had received traditional surgery was between 30 and 40 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In contrast, Teoh said the recurrence rate in those who had received ERBT dropped to about 28 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Essentially during the [new] surgery, we try to preserve the whole tumour, try not to touch it, avoid fragmentation of the tumour, and also the whole specimen can be retrieved in one piece to ensure a complete resection by histology,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is currently available at 13 hospitals in Hong Kong, including Prince of Wales Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Princess Margaret Hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Teoh said all bladder cancer patients with a tumour size of less than three centimetres could consult with their doctors about having the new surgery.

    'Retailers must maintain their competitiveness'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Algernon Yau, on Wednesday urged the retail sector to enhance its efforts in maintaining its competitiveness.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Delivering his speech at the Hong Kong Retail Summit, organised by the Hong Kong Retail Management Association, Yau said economic activity in the city had returned to normal and tourist numbers were growing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Yau said the retail sector still faced various challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We must also confront the various new challenges facing the retail industry, as the preferences and behaviour patterns of tourists - and Hongkongers - are changing," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Retailers must keep pace with these changes, continuously innovate, and adjust their operational strategies in order to maintain their competitiveness and advantage in an ever-changing market environment."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at the summit, the chairwoman of the city’s retail management association, Annie Yau-Tse, said the retail performance in both the tourist and local markets had been disappointing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We [have been seeing] the trend of [budget travel] since last year. That's why we see that the tourists are actually focusing on enjoying their time in Hong Kong, like taking photos, but not really buying," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This trend is actually really affecting our industry, because in the past we have been making a lot of business out of the tourists who are actually coming for shopping. But nowadays, you don't really see too many people carrying their suitcases for shopping."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau-Tse said retailers in Hong Kong should leverage technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to understand consumer patterns better and create tailored promotion plans to adapt to the changing market dynamics.

<div class="itemFullText">
 DAB lawmaker and lawyer Holden Chow has accused Lord Jonathan Sumption of "political advocacy" over his comments in an opinion piece earlier this week that commented on Hong Kong's rule of law.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption, who recently resigned as a judge on the Court of Final Appeal, wrote an article in the Financial Times newspaper entitled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on RTHK's
  <a href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/news-programmes/this-episode.htm?cmsid=77&episode_id=957633&livetime=20240612000000" style="font-size: inherit; color: #1a0dab" target="_blank">

  programme, Chow said the judge's comments were "grossly inappropriate".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow said they would put pressure on the courts when they heard cases, and contrasted Sumption's words with the comments from two other departing justices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Earlier, Chief Executive John Lee also spoke out over the comments, saying a judge's professional duty is to interpret and apply the law, and that his or her expertise is not on politics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said the judge had expressed different views a few years ago.

    Six national security fugitives stripped of passports

    <![CDATA[<img alt="A government spokesperson said the six individuals wanted for alleged national security offences has continued to endanger national security after fleeing to the United Kingdom. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1757045_1_20240612095301.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Six people wanted here for alleged national security offences have been stripped of their SAR passports under homegrown national security legislation passed in March.
 <br>
  <br/>
  People will also be barred from providing funds and resources to the six, dealing with assets and property owned by the fugitives, or entering into a joint venture with them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those found in violation of the order against Nathan Law, Mung Siu-tat, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng, Johnny Fok and Tony Choi face seven years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mung and Choi have also been temporarily removed from their posts as company directors, while authorities also ordered a temporary suspension of qualification to practise for Fok.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, a government spokesman said security secretary Chris Tang issued the order against the six according to the national security law, after they fled to the United Kingdom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "These lawless wanted criminals are hiding in the United Kingdom and continue to blatantly engage in activities that endanger national security. They also make scaremongering remarks to smear and slander the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "More so, they continue to collude with external forces to protect their evil deeds. We therefore have taken such measure to give them a strong blow."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Tang said the cancellation of passports did not violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Immigration Department will, according to our law, cancel their passports. And there's a well-established mechanism among different countries regarding how to notify the cancellation of passports," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's absolutely no contravention to the covenant... according to all those covenants, there are exceptions because of national security grounds. This is not just applicable to Hong Kong, but applies to all civilised societies."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With some of the six active on fundraising platforms, the security secretary warned that people could breach the order by giving monetary support to them.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is an offence to provide funds or to handle funds for those specified absconders, no matter what platform it is," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang said authorities must take action against the six, whom he said Britain was harbouring, adding that officials could issue similar orders in future when necessary.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong University's faculty of medicine on Tuesday said it had developed a new technique which would make it faster to identify the precise treatment for liver cancer patients.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using three-dimensional bio-printing, researchers produced cube-shaped models which mimicked tumours or cancerous cells.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Different drugs would then be administered to see which was most effective, saving the need for patients to go through clinical trials, as well as precious time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This will be very important in developing new treatments, or screen new drugs for the cancer patients, especially in new therapy," said Professor Man Kwan, who led the study.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To produce a "liver-in-cube", researchers must first collect tissue samples from the patient. The samples are then processed into "bio-ink", the essential ingredient for bio-printing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to half a dozen cubes can be produced to speed up drug screening, as well as learn about the tumour's reaction to different treatments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Man believed the technique could be applied to other types of cancer too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This technology can be applied on different cancers - not only for liver cancer, [but also] lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer as well," the surgeon said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technique is undergoing pre-clinical studies to affirm its safety and efficacy. Man would not disclose the cost for patients, citing confidentiality agreements with potential partners.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Both the Bar Association and the Law Society on Tuesday expressed confidence towards Hong Kong's judicial independence, following an opinion piece by a former non-permanent judge of the city's top court.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lord Jonathan Sumption, who has resigned as a judge of the Court of Final Appeal, penned an article in the Financial Times which mentioned Hong Kong's rule of law and a recent ruling in a landmark subversion trial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Bar Association said the city has faced numerous challenges over the past few years and the judiciary's role has "never been more important".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The [association] has every confidence in the independence of our judiciary and we urge the public to support the work of our judges and every effort to safeguard judicial independence and to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is also important to appreciate that our judges can only decide cases on the basis of the legal arguments advanced and the evidence before them."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association added that it would not comment on specific cases, particularly those which are currently under judicial consideration.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the retirement of Madam Justice Beverley McLachlin from the top court, the legal body expressed its gratitude towards the former Canadian top judge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are grateful for her contributions to the rule of law and administration of justice in Hong Kong since she was first appointed to the [Court of Final Appeal] in 2018. We echo the sentiment in her statement regarding her confidence in the members of the court, their independence and their determination to uphold the rule of law in Hong Kong," it said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Law Society also expressed confidence in the judiciary, with its new president, Roden Tong, highlighting its independence and the city's robust legal system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When asked about Lord Sumption's opinion piece, Tong said legal professionals should refrain from making political comments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think as a legal professional, one should always remember that our duty to discharging our duties has to be apolitical – commenting simply from a legal perspective and not from any political lens," he said.

    'Cathay cadet training to resume if conditions met'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Cathay Pacific on Tuesday said solo flight training for its cadets would resume once they follow the flying school's requirements.
 <br>
  <br/>
  AeroGuard Flight Training Centre, a pilot training school in the United States, reportedly suspended all solo flights for Cathay cadets, after some failed to report incidents while out flying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The airline's general manager flying Tim Burns said training for cadets would continue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There's many different areas which need to be trained. Solo flying is just one small proportion. So the students will continue on the rest of their training," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some will have some of their solo flying delayed, while AeroGuard ensures that the cadets are aware of how to report any incidents and that everyone does follow the requirements of the flying school, and once that's satisfied, then they will resume the solo flying."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Cathay said the last of its aircraft, that was stored during the pandemic, is back in Hong Kong - marking a milestone for the airline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR’s flag carrier said 85 of its passenger aircraft were parked outside of Hong Kong due to the impact of the pandemic. One of these locations was Alice Springs in Australia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alex McGowan, the airline's chief operations and service delivery officer, said bringing the fleet back was a remarkable achievement for the company, with Cathay expecting its passenger flights to return to pre-pandemic level by the first quarter of next year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In order to rebuild, everything in the ecosystem needs to be working in harmony, so our aircraft coming back into service is one aspect. Ensuring that our pilots and our cabin crew are recruited and trained to the right standards after a long period of not flying or not flying regularly is important as well," he said.

    Exco approves 3 percent pay rise for civil servants

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Civil servants are set to receive an across-the-board pay rise of three percent, backdated to the beginning of April this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive in Council on Tuesday approved the move, with the proposal to be tabled to Legco as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Executive Council said it thoroughly considered the response to the pay rise from government staff, and balanced a number of factors under the adjustment mechanism.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These include the state of Hong Kong's economy, the government's fiscal position, inflation, pay trend indicators and civil service morale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Civil Service Bureau said the authorities had to be prudent with the adjustment, given the government's current deficit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the meantime, the vacancy level in the civil service has climbed to 10 percent under a tight labour market. Civil servants of all ranks have shouldered additional responsibilities," a spokesperson said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy has recorded actual growth with inflation over the past year. There were also pay rises in private organisations."

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Andrew Cheung says striking the right balance between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security can be difficult and outcomes are controversial at times. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756943_1_20240611145227.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Justice Andrew Cheung said on Tuesday that the judiciary is firmly committed to protecting people's fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, adding that he is confident the courts handle appeals with integrity and professionalism.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Cheung's statement came in response to an opinion piece by Lord Jonathan Sumption, who resigned as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption had said in an article published in the Financial Times that the rule of law in Hong Kong was "profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Cheung said that finding the right balance between protecting people's rights and ensuring national security can be challenging and controversial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As in other jurisdictions, a tension often exists between protection of fundamental rights and safeguarding national security, both of which the Hong Kong Judiciary is firmly committed to doing," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Striking the right balance in individual cases can be difficult and outcomes controversial at times. It is one thing to disagree with a court's decision, but it is quite another to suggest that fundamental rights have been compromised because of political concerns."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung also said that while everyone has the right to express their views, public opinions potentially put pressure on or interfere with the courts' administration of justice, and should therefore be expressed with caution.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that all judges are obliged to make impartial and independent decisions based on the law and evidence, as stated in their judicial oath.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Any suggestion that their decisions have been or may be influenced by extraneous considerations, political or otherwise, is a serious allegation that must be duly substantiated and should not be lightly made," he said.

    Privacy watchdog issues AI adoption guidelines

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung says workers should retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756939_1_20240611143448.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data on Tuesday issued a set of guidelines for organisations to protect data when using artificial intelligence systems.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The privacy watchdog said local institutions are becoming aware of the privacy risks that AI poses, as more and more of them start making use of such technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Almost half of all organisations in Hong Kong are expected to use AI this year – up from 30 percent in 2023, according to the Productivity Council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung said a lot of information needs to be collected to train or operate AI systems and people's privacy will be infringed if these details are leaked.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the new Model Personal Data Protection Framework details steps organisations should take when procuring and using any AI system that makes use of personal details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, institutions are advised to minimise the collection of personal data, conduct rigorous testing of their system, ensure data security and devise an incident response plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung said organisations should also let workers retain control when high-risk AI applications are used to help make decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If the use of the AI system involves the collection of biometric data, of course that would be a high-risk scenario. And if the AI system is to provide recommendations on the granting of credit to individuals or institutions, that would also be a high-risk scenario," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, if the AI system is only used to provide basic information relating to the services or products of the organisation, such as information provided by an AI chatbot, the risk would be lower."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chung added that organisations should also offer their customers adequate information on their AI systems and allow them to access, correct or delete their data.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hongkongers are set to travel and visit exhibitions at no cost while enjoying a raft of discounts on July 1, as part of celebrations to mark the 27th anniversary of the city's return to the motherland.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Revealing the celebration plans at a press briefing ahead of this week's Executive Council meeting, Chief Executive John Lee said all tram and light rail journeys will be free, as well as some bus services in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A number of MTR routes will be free for children aged between three and 11, while residents will be welcome to use various indoor and outdoor facilities run by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department free of charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Those who are interested in arts and history can get free access to the regular and standard exhibitions at the Hong Kong Science Museum, Hong Kong Space Museum and M+ Museum, as well as special exhibitions at the Hong Kong Museum of Art.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, all exhibitions at the Hong Kong Palace Museum will be free, and there will be no charge to get into the Hong Kong Wetland Park.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visitors to Ocean Park will get 30 percent off their tickets between June 29 and July 1, and children as well as the elderly will get discounted tickets when they take the Peak Tram on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Over a thousand restaurants will roll out discounts on July 1.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added that more details will be revealed by various government departments and organisations at a later date.

 Dragonboat teams throughout Hong Kong had spent months preparing for Monday's Tuen Ng Festival races. One of those teams was Hong Kong's only dragonboat crew made up primarily of the visually impaired – the Darkness Fighters.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Their mantra is to "challenge the impossible", and their goal: to create a blind-friendly sports environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our reporter Anne Chan attended the Fighters' training sessions to see how members of the team were able to conquer their limitations by rowing together.

  His remarks came after state broadcaster CCTV, quoting the China Manned Space Agency, reported that the 10 people were selected as the fourth batch of national preparatory astronauts, among whom eight were space pilots, and two were payload specialists from Hong Kong and Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he felt very excited and encouraged by the selection of a Hong Kong candidate, as he thanked the central government for providing the opportunity for Hongkongers to participate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It's only under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle that the SAR is eligible for selection in the national space programme, as the programme is a national task.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Secondly, [the selection] indicates that the nation attaches great importance to the SAR's technological and innovation development. The SAR government will continue to promote measures to nurture more innovation and technology talent and support the city in becoming an international tech and innovation hub,” Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Echoing Lee, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, also expressed his congratulations, as he pledged the SAR government would do everything possible to assist the candidate successfully complete their training on the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I know the public is looking forward to knowing about who is selected, but as we know there are many considerations from the nation when selecting preparatory astronauts, and in its usual practice, the nation will only publish the number of the candidates for the time being, and will not reveal the identities of the candidates.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The SAR government will continue to maintain communications with mainland authorities, and publish details in due course,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The technology chief also noted the candidate was among 120 people who were originally signed up for the recruitment drive in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “In addition to the basic physical and educational requirements, there’s also quite diverse professional requirements in areas including natural science, engineering, biomedics,” Sun said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  While both Lee and Sun did not disclose the Hong Kong astronaut’s identity and other details, sources told RTHK the person selected was Lai Ka-ying, a chief inspector with the Hong Kong Police Force.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She has a doctoral degree and has three children. She will travel to the mainland for subsequent training.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The recruitment of astronauts from Hong Kong and Macau was launched in October 2022, marking the first time the nation’s space programme considered selecting astronauts from the two SARs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three selection rounds have been held since the recruitment drive was launched, and Lee noted the recruitment process was very strict.

    Judges should focus on legal matters, not politics: CE

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday a judge's professional duty is to interpret and apply the law, and that his or her expertise is not on politics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lee also said a departing non-permanent judge, Lord Jonathan Sumption, had contradicted his earlier comments with an opinion piece in the Financial Times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Sumption, who recently resigned as a judge on the Court of Final Appeal, wrote an article in the British newspaper titled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said the overseas judge had expressed different views a few years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In 2021, Lord Sumption refused to take part in a political boycott orchestrated in the UK. And he said then that people should not confuse the rule of law with democracy," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "His latest statement indicates that he doesn't like the political situation in Hong Kong. But this is exactly the area he has told us in 2021 that should not be confused with the rule of law. His recent statement looks to me to be contradictory to his previous stance in this regard."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said judges should focus on handling legal matters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Judges' professional expertise is on law, based on his legal knowledge and experience. Judges' professional expertise is not on politics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A judge is entitled to his personal political preferences, but that is not a judge's area of professional expertise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A judge can like a particular system or dislike it. He may also like a particular law or not. But his professional duty is to interpret and apply that particular piece of law in accordance with legal principles and evidence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also hit out at overseas efforts to attack the rule of law, saying that non-interference in the judicial process is "the DNA of Hong Kong's rule of law".

    HKU heads must put interests of university first: CE

 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said he stressed the importance of communication and cooperation when he met University of Hong Kong officials involved in a spat over senior appointments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Vice-chancellor Zhang Xiang recently complained that he was left in the dark about appointments made by Priscilla Wong, chairwoman of the university's governing council.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said he has met both Zhang and Wong and reminded them to put the interests of the university first.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[HKU] doesn't belong to the vice-chancellor. It doesn't belong to any individual of the council. HKU belongs to all Hong Kong people," the CE said before attending this week's Executive Council meeting.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In all matters, we must take the interest of HKU as the overriding principle. Universities need to seek continuous improvement."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee said there are certain requirements universities have to conform to when they are given billions of dollars in public money, including on governance, administration and finances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Procedures need to be clarified if they are unclear, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Tuesday afternoon, the government announced the formation of a taskforce to investigate the controversy at the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As the [Education Bureau] has gathered from relevant parties, there is inconsistency in the information provided by different parties and a need to clarify the facts and study how to deal with the matter," a government spokesman said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The taskforce will carry out fact-finding, coordinate internal communication and cooperation within HKU, and make recommendations on improvement measures to ensure that public money is well spent and that the university operates within regulations on public grants.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Permanent Secretary for Education Michelle Li, and Tim Lui who chairs the University Grants Committee, will be on the taskforce and officials say they will start their work as soon as possible.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A government statement has expressed "strong disagreements" over remarks made by a departing non-permanent judge of the top appeals court, Lord Jonathan Sumption, who wrote an opinion piece entitled "The rule of law in Hong Kong is in grave danger".
 <br>
  <br/>
  The overseas judge wrote in the Financial Times that his local counterparts were caught "in an impossible political environment created by China", and that the rule of law was "profoundly compromised in any area about which the government feels strongly".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also mentioned a recent ruling on a landmark subversion trial, saying it was "symptomatic of a growing malaise in the Hong Kong judiciary".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said there was "absolutely no truth" that Hong Kong's courts were "under any political pressure from the central authorities in the adjudication of national security cases, or that there is any decline in the rule of law in the SAR".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson said anyone who suggested otherwise would be "utterly wrong, totally baseless, and must be righteously refuted", regardless of their reasoning or motives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The statement went on to quote Chief Executive John Lee, who said the Hong Kong government "has never, and also will not allow anyone to interfere with the prosecutions of the Department of Justice and trials by the court".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is how it was in the past, how it is at present, and how it will be in future. The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and will not change," Lee said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary has confirmed that non-permanent judge Beverley McLachlin, who sits on the city’s top court, will not stay on when her term expires at the end of July this year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Madam McLachlin, who once served as the Chief Justice of Canada, has been a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal since 2018.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In July 2021, the former Canadian top judge had her term extended for three more years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Canadian media cited Madam McLachlin as saying that she had turned 80 years old and would end her term as scheduled in late July, adding that she had confidence in the court's judicial independence and determination to maintain the rule of law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The SAR government thanked the judge for her contribution to Hong Kong's judicial system, as well as her objective appraisal of the rule of law in the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said in a statement that Madam McLachlin had reiterated "her confidence in the members of the court, their independence, and their determination to uphold the rule of law".

<div class="itemFullText">
 Police investigating the death of a man, who was dumped outside of North District Hospital with serious injuries early on Saturday, said they had made an arrest.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Detectives said the 32-year-old suspect was picked up in Tin Shui Wai and was believed to be linked to the car used to drop off the victim in Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Acting senior superintendent Basil Tang, from the New Territories North Crime Regional Headquarters, said officers received a report from a passer-by at around 5.45am on Saturday that the 23-year-old man was lying unconscious near a pedestrian crossing on Po Kin Road, where the hospital is located.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the victim was then brought inside the hospital where he was pronounced dead an hour later.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang also said that the deceased had multiple injuries that are thought to have been caused by blunt objects, punches and kicks, adding that his cause of death was still under investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were called to a suspicious vehicle in Wong Chuk Yuen in Pat Heung on Sunday evening.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police arrived at the scene to conduct an investigation and believed that this vehicle was involved in the incident. At the time of the incident, someone put on a fake license plate and abandoned the deceased outside of the mentioned hospital," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police and laboratory personnel later searched the car and found blood stains and a stun gun."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police were treating the case as murder, saying they believe others were involved and remained at large.

    'Catering revenue down by 30pc over Tuen Ng Festival'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Simon Wong, head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, says the local catering sector saw revenues down by 30 percent year on year during the Tuen Ng Festival period. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756819_1_20240610171210.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A catering sector representative on Monday said the holiday weekend had brought little cheer to the industry, with revenues down by about 30 percent compared with last year's Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The slump came despite Immigration Department figures suggesting that fewer Hongkongers travelled to the mainland than those who headed out over Easter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to official figures, some 840,000 Hongkongers headed north over Saturday and Sunday, 10 percent less compared with the number seen in the first two days of the Easter holiday period when over one million residents travelled to the mainland.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “[But]I don't see any positive signs on our revenues,” said Simon Wong, the head of the Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades, in an interview with RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His remarks came as official data also showed that more mainland visitors, or some 250,000 people, visited the SAR over Saturday and Sunday, over 40 percent more compared with the 170,000 recorded during the first two days of the Easter holiday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We do have some activities going on in these couple of days, [especially] some activities in the Tsim Sha Tsui area that would attract more people, including tourists from the mainland and also local residents,” Wong said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “But in other districts in Hong Kong, it became quieter - in a way that too many people went over to the harbour area,” he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the catering veteran noted that sales of “zongzi”, the traditional holiday sticky rice dumplings, were not ideal either, down by about 20 percent compared with previous years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “People are more concerned about [their] health now. In the past, a lot of retail outlets produced their own ‘zongzi’, but in the festival this year, some restaurants did not offer this kind of product. Most of the new [zongzi] products [did not generate] good sales either,” Wong explained, adding that some residents also bought "zongzi" on the mainland instead of Hong Kong due to the cheaper prices.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pointing to the increasing challenges faced by local restaurants, as more mainland brands expand into the SAR to test the market before going abroad, Wong said that the local catering industry could learn from their mainland peers, including using technology, to ease their difficulties including manpower issues.

 Firefighters on Monday said they found about 40 suspected cat corpses, after extinguishing a fire in Yuen Long.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Officers said the fire broke out in a tin-sheet house on Kam Shui South Road in Pat Heung at around 11am.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firefighters said no one was injured and suspect that an electrical short circuit caused the fire.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said they believe stray cats and dogs were being looked after in the premises, and they have notified the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to follow up the case.

    HK dragon boats make waves in Tuen Ng Festival

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The sound of cheering crowds and the rhythmic pounding of drums filled the air at venues across Hong Kong on Monday, as dragon boat races took place to celebrate Tuen Ng Festival.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Thousands of paddlers enjoyed the fruits of months of back-breaking training as they took to the waters of Stanley, Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sai Kung, Tuen Mun, Aberdeen, and Tai O.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Sha Tin, the Marine Dragon Boat Team celebrated victory in one of 28 races.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The atmosphere here is very, very exciting. The weather is good too! We’ve dedicated two months to practice. Regardless of whether it's day or night, we all strive together in our practices," said one team paddler.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It feels refreshing to see everyone putting in such effort and working together towards the same goal. It feels great. The atmosphere is exceptional. Everyone is happy, cheering for them together. I will come back to see it again next year," said Sabrina Wang, a tourist watching the races for the very first time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, some 190 teams competed off Stanley Main Beach in the morning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chris from City University said his team had practised for 10 months.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We heard that rain had poured every year here, but the weather is fine today. Synchronisation is the most important factor. Individual strength matters less. The overall strength of a team is the essence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bonnie Chan, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, said the HKEX team was full of confidence going into their competition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We practised even when the Typhoon Signal No. 3 was issued, during an Amber Rainstorm Warning, and even a Red Rainstorm Warning. Today, we were finally able to get into the water. We are thrilled," she said.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Li Kwai-yin, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association, says she welcomes the government's plan to contract out dental treatment for civil servants to the mainland. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=90&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756791_1_20240610124418.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The head of a civil service union on Monday welcomed the administration's plan to facilitate dental services in Greater Bay Area cities so government workers can get faster treatment.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This came after the Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, floated the idea last week, noting a lack of dentists in public clinics in the SAR, while acknowledging authorities need to offer more benefits to retain staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, Li Kwai-yin, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants’ Association, said she welcomed the government’s plan, but noted officials should move fast to ramp up dental services as the dentist manpower crunch was rather “severe”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For example, regarding the dental cleaning service, in the past we had it about once every 12 to 18 months, but now it takes 40 months to receive the next appointment notice to do dental cleaning, and the waiting time for dental treatment services is even longer - it's taking years to receive treatments.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For some newly joined civil servants, they didn't even get a chance to do a dental check after waiting for three to four years,” she told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Li also noted that Grade 3A general hospitals in Shenzhen, or the University of Hong Kong–Shenzhen Hospital, could be prioritised to save on travelling time under the plan, and that the scope of the treatments could not only cover dental cleaning, but also other simple treatments, such as tooth filling and tooth extraction procedures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Private institutions with quality services could be considered as well, Li added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also hopes authorities could further study the feasibility of sharing medical and health records between hospitals in the SAR and the mainland to ease the city's tight dental care services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government last July rolled out a pilot scheme on dental scaling for eligible civil servants to reduce the burden on public healthcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a TV programme on Sunday, civil service minister Yeung said there were some technical difficulties with tracking health records and determining the scope of treatments that could be done outside Hong Kong, but noted that authorities need to provide more benefits to maintain the competitiveness of civil service jobs in the face of a broader manpower shortage issue.

    'Ban flavoured shisha to reduce smokers in HK'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<img alt="'Ban flavoured shisha to reduce smokers in HK'" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756786_1_20240610115720.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A tobacco control advocate on Monday said the government should ban flavoured shisha, as part of an overhaul of smoking controls.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Henry Tong, chairman of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health, made the comment after the administration announced 10 measures last week to quickly reduce smoking, including a ban on flavoured cigarettes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on an RTHK programme, he noted that shisha, or tobacco smoked through a waterpipe, remains legal, but said it should face similar regulations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Shisha is very attractive to young people and women, mainly because there are many flavours and fruity flavours. The law should be clear when it comes to banning flavoured cigarettes. There shouldn't be flavouring agents allowed in shisha," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The implementation of new policies is a step-by-step process, and it is necessary to understand the public's acceptance level. Banning sales and purchases is the first step. I think we can continue to study how to prohibit possession and hopefully that can be implemented soon."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong also said that banning smoking in queues was a good start given that regulations were easy to define, but a measure to stop "smoking while walking" should be implemented as soon as possible.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Tsui Yuen, a member of the Long-Term Tobacco Policy Concern Group, said he agreed with the extension of smoke-free areas, but suggested the addition of smoking areas as a means of compromise.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Non-smoking areas can suppress the problem of second-hand smoking and reduce conflicts between smokers and non-smokers. In addition to adding non-smoking areas, we can also follow Japan and Europe and add some smoking areas or smoking rooms for public use. This can reduce the problem of second-hand smoking, limit littering and help the environment," he said.

    Govt urged to limit how much helpers can borrow

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government was on Sunday urged to limit how much domestic helpers are allowed to borrow and to introduce licensing for debt collectors.
 <br>
  <br/>
  DAB lawmaker Edward Leung made the call after being approached for help by around 20 employers, who told him that their helpers had fallen victim to loan traps after filling out online forms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said helpers had to pay back amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to HK$100,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Currently in Hong Kong, [lenders] need to get a licence. However for debt collectors, they do not need to apply for a licence. However, in many places around the world for example in the UK, debt collectors do need a licence," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If this kind of situation worsens in Hong Kong, I believe that it will force the government to take further steps to set up certain laws to contain this kind of illegal debt collecting. For example, for debt collectors, they need to apply for a certain licence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said one disturbing trend involved debt collectors threatening to publish AI-generated pornographic deepfake photos of employers who refused to pay their helpers' debts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also noted a case of a helper borrowing money from a lender outside Hong Kong and being hit with a demand for more than double the sum just two weeks later.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has said that top officials of a Christian college set up to help students quit drugs have only themselves to blame for its imminent closure.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng College announced on Friday that the school on Lantau Island would close on July 7. It comes after four members of staff were arrested in a conspiracy to defraud case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Three former board members of the association are on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The association's new directors said police had frozen HK$4 million in the college's bank accounts, and the government owed HK$3.5 million in project fees.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response to an RTHK enquiry, the government denied owing the cash-strapped college money and said it had provided emergency funding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In fact, as long as the two fugitive former directors of the Christian Zheng Sheng Association, Jacob Lam and Alman Chan, cooperate and complete the procedures to change bank account signatures, the problem can be solved," the spokesperson said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson added that officials are offering assistance to students affected by Zheng Sheng's closure, including helping to transfer five of them who are currently living in a drug rehabilitation under the college.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, the college's supervisor Choi Hong-sheung criticised the new directors for being influenced by the two former directors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi and three other board members resigned on Friday.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said a government-owned investment vehicle will sign a cooperation deal on Wednesday with a local "tech unicorn" – a start-up company worth more than US$1 billion.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his official blog, Chan did not name the company concerned, but said it operated in the artificial intelligence and smart manufacturing field.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the tie-up with Hong Kong Investment Corporation will help the business expand research and development investment here, as well as fund training of staff.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The finance minister also said the deal would help the company roll out the use of its AI models in the Greater Bay Area and speed up digital transformation in the region.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan added that the purpose of the corporation is to help promote innovation and technology in Hong Kong by attracting enterprises and professionals with high potential.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He noted that the number of tech start-ups in the city exceeded 4,250 last year.

    Flavoured tobacco ban won't put off visitors: minister

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau on Sunday said there is no reason to believe that people who use flavoured cigarettes legally at home will be put off visiting Hong Kong by a proposed ban on the products.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures put forward this week to reduce the number of smokers in the SAR, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme, Lo said he believes visitors won't be dissuaded, noting that tourists still visit Singapore despite its stricter anti-smoking measures.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "People come to Hong Kong not to smoke; they come to Hong Kong for the business opportunities, for our food, for all the tourist attractions. And they love to have a refreshing, lively, healthy city, rather than a city full of smoke and all those cigarette butts on the floor. So I would categorically say that this is not an issue," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health minister also played down concerns raised by newspaper vendors that their businesses would suffer after the ban on flavoured tobacco, which makes up about half of their cigarette sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For those newspaper vendors, I understand that this is part of their business, but they have other areas of their business. If some of these people are talking about the illicit cigarettes, I guess these are illegal activities and these vendors should not be performing such business."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On outlawing smoking while in a queue, Lo said the concept of queuing is easy to understand since most Hongkongers have been taught how to line up since kindergarten. He added that the definition of a queue will be made clearer during the law-making process.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The health chief also said it's unprecedented that the government raised the tobacco tax for two consecutive years, adding that the authorities will explore whether there is room for a further increase next year.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A mobile app developed by the Chinese University has proved to be effective in diagnosing symptoms of depression, and researchers hope the invention can increase people's willingness to seek help at an early stage.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Using artificial intelligence, the app evaluates users' mental status by analysing attributes such as facial expression, voice and language.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A study was conducted between June 2021 and March 2023 to verify the tool's effectiveness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  More than 180 participants who took part regularly used the app to rate their mood state, and record videos of themselves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers noted that compared to healthy individuals, those suffering from depression tended to frown more and smile less. They also paused more often in their speech and used more negative emotion words.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Participants also wore devices which measured their rest activity. Data suggested depression patients were less active and suffered from sleep problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The self-assessment can be performed at home, without the need for face-to-face clinical consultations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Researchers hope this will make the tool more palatable to potential patients.

    Authorities to offer help to Zheng Sheng students

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for Education Christine Choi on Saturday said authorities will offer assistance to students and staff affected by the closure of Christian Zheng Sheng College, including helping them find new schools or jobs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The school, which helps teenagers fight drug addiction, has announced that it will cease operating in July.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government has issued a statement on Friday, saying it wasn't notified about the closure. It blamed those wanted by the police for the school's financial problems, saying they were trying to avoid responsibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, Choi said about 10 students and eight teachers would be affected.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We're working with different departments, and the associated school to help the students. If some students want to keep studying, we'll help them find the right programmes. And since students are at different ages, some might want to start working. We'll talk to them about that too. For the teachers, we'll help them with their pay. We'll work with other departments to make sure everything is taken care of,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She noted the HK$1.8 million that had been earlier allocated to the school through the About Beat Drugs Fund would also be used to help cover the school's daily expenses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, the education minister also said that the bureau is starting discussions with the parties involved in the recent dispute over the appointment of interim vice-presidents at the University of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKU president Zhang Xiang has accused the university council of bypassing him over the decision. Some former council members of the university also issued a letter to the Chief Executive John Lee, saying they have lost faith in the council's chairperson Priscilla Wong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi stressed that it's common for a large organisation like a university to have different opinions, saying it's important for everyone involved to share their thoughts openly. She said she’s confident that a decision will be made soon.

    Safeguard national security for a stable HK: CE

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said safeguarding national security is fundamental for a strong and stable Hong Kong.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Lee said national security loopholes were addressed after Basic Law Article 23 legislation took effect in March.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "From the anti-national education movement in 2012, Occupy Central in 2014, the Mong Kok unrest in 2016, to the 2019 social unrest and the Hong Kong version of a 'colour revolution', they used large-scale riots to create unrest," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Thanks to the central government, decisive action was taken to implement the National Security Law in Hong Kong. It addressed the legal vacuum surrounding national security, it improved the electoral system, and implemented the principle of patriots governing Hong Kong. The city has finally returned to normality."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Secretary for Justice Paul Lam said some countries had attempted to ruin Hong Kong's unique role in the nation's development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "History tells us that we cannot afford to disregard national security risks. Indeed, security and development have a symbiotic relationship: one cannot exist without the other, and one will benefit the other. This is sheer logic and common sense," Lam said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Our national security law based on the principles of the rule of law provides high-standard security to guarantee and safeguard the better and sustainable development of Hong Kong in the long run."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The one-day forum is taking place at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.

    NSL demonstrates HK's constitutional duty: Zheng

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of Beijing's liaison office on Saturday said the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong to curb disorder.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a national security legal forum in Wan Chai, Zheng Yanxiong said a dual legislation and dual enforcement mechanism between the SAR and the mainland was established after the National Security Law was implemented in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It demonstrates the SAR's constitutional duty. It shows that Hong Kong's mechanisms for safeguarding national security and enforcement have improved, while addressing previous shortcomings - and ensuring that the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle is on the right track," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng added that 45 out of 47 defendants were convicted in a subversion case after they were involved in an unofficial legislative primary election.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Different sectors generally affirmed the ruling, believed that it disseminated correct messages on the rule of law, showed the determination and confidence of the society in safeguarding national security."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Nong Rong, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said the National Security Law had been effective in improving governance and creating prosperity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Over the past four years, Hong Kong has made a significant transformation from chaos to governance, returning to the track of development. In March, Hong Kong completed legislation for Article 23 of the Basic Law, further solidifying the legal shield for safeguarding national security," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Hong Kong National Security Law explicitly identifies its purpose as maintaining the prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR, highlighting this original aspiration to protect development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the head of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the central government Dong Jingwei said the central government has full trust in the SAR government, authorising it to have the responsibility for safeguarding national security.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the central government would deal with any problems that the SAR government finds difficult to handle.

    HK-born US astronaut Anders dies in plane crash

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong-born retired US astronaut William Anders, who was one of the first three humans to orbit the moon, capturing the famed "Earthrise" photo during Nasa's Apollo 8 mission in 1968, died on Friday in the crash of a small aeroplane in Washington state. He was 90.
 <br>
  <br/>
  NASA chief Bill Nelson paid tribute to Anders on social media with a post of the iconic image of Earth rising over the lunar horizon, saying the former Air Force pilot "offered to humanity among the deepest of gifts an astronaut can give."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Heritage Flight Museum near Burlington, Washington, which he co-founded, confirmed that Anders was killed in an aircraft accident.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was piloting the plane alone when it went down off the coast of Jones Island, part of the San Juan Islands archipelago north of Seattle, between Washington and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, The Seattle Times reported, citing his son, Greg.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  According to television station KCPQ-TV, a Fox affiliate in Tacoma, Anders, a resident of San Juan County, was at the controls of a vintage Air Force single-engine T-34 Mentor that he owned.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Video footage showed on KCPQ showed a plane plunging from the skies in a steep dive before slamming into the water just offshore.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A US Naval Academy graduate and Air Force pilot, Anders joined Nasa in 1963 as a member of the third group of astronauts. He did not go into space until December 21, 1968, when Apollo 8 lifted off on the first crewed mission to leave Earth orbit and travel 240,000 miles (386,000 km) to the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Anders was the "rookie" on the crew, alongside Frank Borman, the mission commander, and James Lovell, who had flown with Borman on Gemini 7 in 1965 and later commanded the ill-fated Apollo 13.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Apollo 8, originally scheduled for 1969, was pushed forward because of concerns the Russians were accelerating their own plans for a trip around the moon by the end of 1968. That gave the crew only several months to train for the historic but highly risky mission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Carried by a Saturn V rocket never before used on a crewed flight and tested only twice, the spacecraft faced the delicate and daunting task of entering and leaving lunar orbit safely. Failure meant crashing into the moon or being forever stranded in orbit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Recalling the mission 40 years later, Anders acknowledged that although confident of success, he thought "there was a one-third chance" the crew "didn't come back."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Trepidation turned to triumph when Apollo 8 reached the moon on Christmas Eve and during its 10 orbits captivated a worldwide television audience of more than a billion people by transmitting the first pictures of the lunar surface just miles below.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A key part of the mission was photographing the moon, but "after about the third revolution, the moon was clearly kind of a boring place. There was nothing but holes and holes upon holes," Anders said at a symposium in 2009.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The astronauts' focus shifted abruptly when the Earth began rising over the lunar surface. "Me, Lovell and Borman suddenly said at once: 'Look at that' - this gorgeous, colourful, beautiful planet of ours coming up over the ugly lunar horizon," Anders told Forbes magazine in 2015.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using a long lens and colour film, Anders ended up snapping the photograph now known as "Earthrise." The image, vividly capturing both the Earth's beauty and fragility in the vastness of space, is considered one of history's most influential photographs, widely credited with helping inspire the environmental movement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Here we came all the way to the moon to discover Earth," Anders later said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also played a key role in another indelible episode from that Christmas Eve mission - leading off as the crew read from the Book of Genesis while Apollo 8 transmitted images of the lunar surface to Earth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The three astronauts were greeted as national heroes when they splashed down three days later in the Pacific Ocean and were feted as Time magazine's "Men of the Year." (Reuters)

    CS secretary says room for political life in new code

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Secretary for the Civil Service, Ingrid Yeung, on Saturday said the new set of rules that government workers must follow wouldn’t restrict them from having a personal political life.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The updated Civil Service Code set out 12 core values public servants must follow, including being professional and staying neutral when it comes to politics. It also asked them to not publicly criticise government policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, Yeung said civil servants can still take part in social activities or public campaigns during their private time, but they need to be careful about being perceived to represent a government standpoint.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We have set out very clearly in the code that civil servants can also have their political life. They can join social activities, except where we have strict rules about not being able to join.  But the principle is when they join social activities, they have to ensure that their participation in these social activities will not cause a conflict of interest with their jobs,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And also their joining would not allow people or attract people to believe that they are representing the government's position, the activities they join have government backing or allow people to think that they are actually representing a larger group of civil servants’ views.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also noted higher rank civil servants, or those taking leadership roles, should be even more cautious.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's difficult to draw a solid line below which [rank] you can be very care-free about what you speak and about which you have to be really very cautious. As you move up, I think civil servants will have to really take care,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Yeung was also asked whether the proposed 3 percent pay rise for all civil servants this year, a move that faced strong opposition from unions, would affect morale. The level of increase is significantly lower than the rises of up to 5.47 percent suggested by a pay trend survey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I believe that civil servants will be able to understand that there are constraints on what the government can do this year especially given our very tight financial situation and also I think as we progress with our various initiatives to improve livelihood and to improve the economy, there will be recognition of the public on what civil servants have done and this is also something that will be able to boost morale,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung said that the final decision would be made by the Executive Council, but noted that the room for adjustment is limited.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Young people have become increasingly enthusiastic in visiting the mainland and experiencing the country's development, according to the home and youth affairs chief.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Alice Mak said the number of applications for a cross-border internship programme this year doubled that from the previous year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On RTHK's Your Home Address programme broadcast on Saturday, the secretary for home and youth affairs also said Hong Kong is set to host a youth development summit this summer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will set up a platform for our young people to exchange views and learn from other young people from other countries and areas. We will invite the participation of guest speakers and youth groups from the mainland and overseas, so that Hong Kong's young people can exchange views and learn from their counterparts in other countries," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We expect that there are no fewer than 1,000 participants for the summit."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Other initiatives targeting young people that have been introduced include a programme for government-backed hostels and an alliance supporting young Hong Kong entrepreneurs in the Greater Bay Area, the minister said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the city's community work, Mak said she's grateful for the efforts by more than 450 care teams across the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have now nearly 5,000 volunteers serving in the care teams. They are willing to contribute to the community," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In a year's time, we have already visited 90,000 households in the community, and we have provided several thousand services for the residents. These are the achievements that we have made only in a year's time. And I believe, and I trust that, as time goes by, we will enhance our service and we can achieve even more in the community."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said people volunteering in the care teams not only respond to emergencies such as the recent deadly blaze in Jordan, but also provide services to those in need such as the elderly.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Christian Zheng Sheng College, a school that helps students quit drugs, announced it's closing down in a month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The college's supervisor, Chui Hong-sheung, said the decision was made on Thursday night during an online board meeting which he didn't take part in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chui pointed out that the cash-strapped college currently has around ten students, and he believes the authorities will make arrangements for them to be transferred elsewhere. He added that some teachers have already quit the school.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Since there are not many students involved, I think it's highly likely that the authorities can offer them help. But whether or not the students and their parents are willing to be transferred is another matter," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Back in January, police arrested four directors of the charity which runs the college, on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud. Three others, including the institution’s head, Alman Chan, were put on the wanted list.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Christian Zheng Sheng earlier told the press that relevant bank accounts had been frozen by officers as part of the probe, and it was facing dire economic difficulties.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government gave the school more than HK$1 million in emergency funding in March, but Chui said the money has since been used up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority said Zheng Sheng College has failed to make MPF contributions for around 20 employees between February and April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said it will take follow up action accordingly.

    'Most public flat tenants have completed declarations'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Director of Housing Rosanna Law said on Friday that most public housing tenants suspected of exceeding income and asset limits have made relevant declarations, and those who haven't done so risk having their homes taken back by the government.
 <br>
  <br/>
  A deadline for some 250,000 so-called "rich tenants" to declare their income and assets passed at the end of last month. People with too much money have to leave their public flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said around 88 percent of tenants have made declarations, and officials will send letters to the rest next week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who still don't make declarations could see their tenancy terminated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will remind you again, that if you wish to continue living in the flat, I will give you a deadline to fill in the declaration form and provide a written reply explaining the late submission," Law said on an RTHK programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said those who don't return the form or fail to provide a clear explanation would be considered to have decided not to extend their tenancy, and the flats will be taken back.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Discretion will be exercised if tenants report family members have been out of Hong Kong or in hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Since the start of the latest round of declarations, officials have taken back more than 1,200 flats, Law said. The units will be reallocated after renovation work.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Law said officials are aware of reports that some public flat tenants have been seen driving luxury cars with cross-boundary licence plates. She said in some cases, investigations will be carried out to see whether there has been any wrongdoing in terms of income and asset checks.

    PolyU device samples soil from far side of moon

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Polytechnic University on Friday said equipment it developed has enabled China’s Chang’e-6 space mission to sample soil from the far side of the moon – the first such feat in history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Professor Yung Kai-leung, director of the university's Research Centre for Deep Space Explorations, said their sampling system, unlike those used by other countries, is fully automated, which means it can prevent contamination and is more efficient.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The device consists of two shovel and claw-shaped samplers, two monitoring cameras, as well as a packaging system, Yung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The automated process involves the cameras selecting an area to sample, before the samplers collect the soil and put it into a container.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The academic said it took his team at the university six years to design and manufacture the sampling system, as it is no easy task operating on the far side of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We still experience communication problems. So we had to modify the method of regolith acquisition so that we can speed up the acquisition, sealing and packing. We had to upgrade our design,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yung said he believes that more than 1.75 kg of lunar soil was collected during an operation on Monday, and the material will be of scientific significance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The lunar regolith, especially those on the far side, are subject to a rigorous environment of space radiation, meteorites and things like that. So they contain a lot of useful elements that we may not be able to find on Earth.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the samples may also help scientists better understand the formation of the moon.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chang’e 6-spacecraft is expected to return to Earth on June 25.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The youth sports ground at the Kai Tak Sports Park will be the first public venue to use "lay and pay" technology for the pitch, with officials saying it should provide more stability and flexibility when organising events.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The venue will be available for events including football and rugby matches, as well as school sports days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Managers of the sports park say about 650 rolls of turf, each measuring 1.2 metres by 10 metres, were harvested in Zhuhai and transported to Hong Kong for installation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hybrid turf consists of 95 percent natural grass and five percent artificial grass fibres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Malcolm Caddies, a general manager at sports venue management company ASM Global, said the turf can minimise the chances of matches being called off due to unstable conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hybrid surface is way more stable, way more secure. You're not going to get soggy fields like you traditionally do in wet conditions, so it will certainly allow for more matches in inclement weather," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Caddies added that a rain harvesting system, which can drain about 1,000 millimetres of rain per hour, has been installed underneath the sports ground to deal with extreme weather.

    Flavoured cigarette ban will deter visitors: lawmaker

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to ban flavoured cigarettes will deter some tourists and businesspeople from coming to Hong Kong, a lawmaker warned on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The move is among 10 new measures aimed at reducing the number of smokers in the city, with others including a blanket ban on e-cigarettes and making it illegal for people to light up if they're in a queue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Retail sector lawmaker Peter Shiu told RTHK he was worried some people would think twice about coming to Hong Kong when they hear about the flavoured cigarette ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Fruit-flavoured cigarettes are sold in all parts of the world. Assuming people are not allowed to purchase these cigarettes, it would mean that their freedom of choice is being restricted,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If some of these people are used to smoking fruit-flavoured cigarettes in their own countries, and they visit Hong Kong where such products are prohibited, they would then think twice before travelling to the SAR for tourism or business.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Henry Tong, who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health, said he was in favour of the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We really welcome the government's new measure... banning flavoured tobacco products would make cigarette smoking much less attractive to young people and female smokers," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Deputy Secretary for Health, Eddie Lee, meanwhile, said the government is adopting a "gradual and systemic" approach to making smoking culturally unacceptable in Hong Kong.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Bar Association on Friday expressed regret over the resignations of two top court judges, and said their departure would not affect the court's judicial functions.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Its remarks came after two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – tendered their resignations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar respects their personal decision and is also grateful for their contributions to the development of our jurisprudence and the rule of law in Hong Kong," the association wrote in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The Bar strongly believes that their resignations will not affect the ability of our apex court in discharging its judicial functions and has every confidence in the independence of our judicial system."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Law Society said it is grateful to all current and past non-permanent judges for their "faithful and fearless discharge of their important role in the administration of justice".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Its president Chan Chak-ming said the society supports keeping overseas non-permanent judges in Hong Kong, as stated in the Basic Law.

    Tobacco control experts welcome new anti-smoking moves

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Judith Mackay from Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. Image: Shutterstock" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1756456_1_20240607092658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An expert in tobacco control has hailed the government's latest moves to bring down the smoking rate, but she says that more measures will be needed going forward especially when it comes to stopping young people from smoking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with RTHK, the director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco Control, Judith Mackay, said the short-term measures, including banning flavoured cigarettes, were spot on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think it is really important that the government has done this," she said. "I mean we still have 600,000 smokers in Hong Kong and we know that 400,000 of them will die from tobacco."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said governments needed to think of new ways to tackle smoking going forward and this included banning the sale of cigarettes to people born after a certain date.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think you can divide tobacco control into two areas. One is existing measures and extending them," she said. "But then we also have to think of new measures and to try to be innovative, particularly in terms of young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay said the idea of having a smoke-free generation had been considered in New Zealand and the UK but had been stymied by changes in government. She said it didn't surprise her that the SAR government hadn't included a ban on sales of tobacco to people born before a certain date in its latest measures but that it was still on the books.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On Thursday, the government proposed a blanket ban on E-cigarettes, flavoured cigarettes and lighting up while in a queue, as part of moves designed to bring about a "cultural change". Other planned measures include removing branding from cigarette packaging and heightening health warnings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mackay also said she had never met a smoker who wanted to keep smoking. She said parents who smoked also didn't want their children to smoke as it was dangerous and expensive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Henry Tong - who chairs the Council on Smoking and Health - said vapes and flavoured cigarettes have been shown to be particularly attractive to young smokers and female smokers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The survey yesterday that the government released shows that about 70 percent of female smokers and young smokers smoke flavoured tobacco products," he said while appearing on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme. "And vapes, e-cigarettes, these are trendy products. They are attractive to young people."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tong said banning the possession of e-cigarettes was the second half of the government's action against the product, after it banned their importation, manufacture and sale two years ago. He said he really welcomed the government's measure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Health Secretary, Lo Chung-mau, has said the government plans to reduce the smoking prevalence rate to to 7.8 [ercent next year from the current 9.1 percent.

 Police said they had arrested three people who allegedly insulted the national anthem ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Hong Kong, China were playing against Iran at the Hong Kong Stadium on Thursday in a 2026 World Cup qualifying match.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers said three people, aged between 18 and 31, turned their backs towards the pitch when the national anthem was played.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They were arrested on suspicion of insulting the national anthem, and are being detained for further investigation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The National Anthem Ordinance came into effect in 2020, stating that people must stand solemnly and must not behave in a disrespectful way when the national anthem is played.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Judiciary said two non-permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal – Lord Collins of Mapesbury and Lord Sumption, both from the UK – have tendered their resignations.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, Chief Justice Andrew Cheung of the Court of Final Appeal “notes with regret” the resignations. He said overseas non-permanent judges, including Lords Collins and Sumption, have made valuable contributions to the top court over the years, and that the Judiciary is committed to upholding the rule of law and judicial independence in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive, John Lee, also expressed regret at the resignations. Lee noted that Lord Collins had stated that he continued to "have the fullest confidence in the Court and the total independence of its members."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, the Secretary for Justice, Paul Lam, said the Department of Justice expresses regret at the judges' resignations, but was grateful for their past contributions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lord Collins has been a non-permanent judge of Hong Kong’s highest court since 2011, Lord Sumption since 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  With the pair’s resignations, there are four Hong Kong non-permanent judges and eight non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions at the Court of Final Appeal, with Justice Allsop from Australia the most recent appointee earlier this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The maximum number of non-permanent judges is 30.
