<div class="itemFullText">
 The final of the Cheung Chau "Bun Scrambling" competition was held on Wednesday night at 12 midnight on the football pitch of the Pak Tai Temple Recreation Ground in Cheung Chau, rounding off a day of festivities attended by tens of thousands of people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Firefighter Yip Kin-man was crowned "Bun King" and nurse Kung Tsz-shan won the title of "Bun Queen."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Nine male and three female finalists competed at the same time, clambering up a 14-metre-high mountain covered in 9,000 plastic buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They had to fill their own bags with buns totalling the most points within the time limit of 3 minutes, to win the coveted titles.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kwok Ka-ming, a regular contestant and one of the favourites for the men's title, won the “Full Pocket of Lucky Buns” prize for snatching the most buns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Cheung Chau Bun Festival originated as a ritual for people to pray for safety from a plague.

    'HK, Singapore to keep complementary roles'

File photo: Reuters" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753267_1_20240515163949.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong and Singapore will maintain their ties as both “complementors” and “competitors” as they navigate their way through an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, a veteran businessman with cross-market experience in both places said on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The remarks came as the Lion City ushered in a new era, with finance minister Lawrence Wong becoming the city-state’s first new prime minister in 20 years, taking over from Lee Hsien Loong who becomes senior minister of the cabinet.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think it's very positive,” said Dennis Chiu, chairman of the Hong Kong Singapore Business Association (HSBA).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “He [Wong] really reflects the meritocracy system of Singapore, because he came from the very bottom of the ladder and then worked his way all up. He is very much a student of the Singapore system to show that.. in Singapore, anybody has a chance to reach the very top,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When asked how the new leadership might impact the business ties between the Lion City and the SAR, Chiu, who is also the executive director of Far East Consortium International and has straddled Hong Kong and Singapore for three decades, said he expects there will be “continuity” in terms of trade and business cooperation between the two places.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Singapore and Hong Kong have always played a complementary and competing role. And when you compete, you actually pick up good points from the other, so I think we are mutually learning from each other, but we also compete for the same dollar of investments,” Chiu said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I really don’t see there will be huge changes, but I think we will perhaps see how changes in the world will affect Hong Kong and Singapore,” he added, warning that geopolitics has become the most challenging factor affecting all economies, especially open economies like the two cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “You have to be neutral and to not choose a side,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The real estate veteran also said Hong Kong and Singapore could continue to cooperate in areas such as technology and digitisation, adoption of artificial intelligence, and green transition.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Hong Kong, frankly speaking, has the huge market of China and the Greater Bay Area, [but] Singapore has Southeast Asia as its very important market. Those will always be the strengths of both of the cities’ finances,” Chiu added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “I think he [Wong] will be able to continue to carry on Lee's systems with him, we do not expect any new changes for the time being, but we want to see how he will be tested when new issues, such as Covid and international crises, come up,” he said. "This is something we all do not know."

    'Fare rise gives cabbies few thousand more a month'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 A taxi trade representative on Wednesday said cabbies are expected to earn thousands of dollars more every month when fares go up, but the sector is experiencing high operating costs and a change in passenger habits.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From July 14, there will be a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng Kwan-shing of the Taxi Dealers & Owners Association said he believes the fare rises will mean cab drivers will earn around HK$100 extra for each shift, or an additional several thousand every month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he told an RTHK programme that both insurance and car maintenance cost more now, and that it's been challenging for nighttime taxi drivers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because passengers have changed their habits, there's been less business. I hope that after the fare hike, the government could help with the financial situation, allowing more individual visitors [to Hong Kong], so that we could get more business," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the same programme, Transport Commissioner Angela Lee ruled out the taxi trade's suggestion of a regular mechanism to review fare rates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade understands its own operating situation best... They may not submit [an application] every year, and it depends on changes to its operations and whether there is a need to ask for fare adjustments," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Every time we receive [an application], we will handle it cautiously and act as the gatekeeper. I think this approach has always been taken and is effective. So we don't have any plans to change it for the time being."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee added that how much cabbies earn is not the sole factor in deciding on fare adjustments.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Children dressed up as Hong Kong celebrities, star athletes, deities and even government officials on Wednesday as thousands of people flocked to Cheung Chau for the island's annual bun festival.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Queues formed from the morning at shops offering buns stamped with peace messages, with sellers pleasantly surprised by the turnout.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We expected that there would be a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the visitor numbers when compared with last year. But the situation is better than our expectations," said one storekeeper surnamed Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think people want to experience the festive vibe, while hoping this can bring them peace and luck."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A man surnamed Wong told RTHK he was waiting patiently to get his hands on more than 10 buns in different flavours, for him and his family.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I have waited for an hour. But I'm fine with queuing. It's not a big deal. It's just once a year. I've been coming to the festival for 12 years, since 2012," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I just hope everything goes smoothly and I wish for good health. The Cheung Chau residents believe that, so I just follow the local customs."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the main highlights of the festival, the Piu Sik Parade, got underway in the afternoon, with children dressed up as various characters making their way through the island's streets on stilts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mini versions of star fencer Cheung Ka-long and swimmer Siobhan Haughey were in the Olympic spirit ahead of the upcoming Paris Games, while there were also sightings of Dragon Ball characters and Hong Kong singer and actor Aaron Kwok.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One child played security minister Chris Tang and another came as Executive Council convenor Regina Ip to explain Article 23 laws to the crowds.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another child was decked out as an officer of the Environmental Protection Department, on duty to promote the city's planned waste charging scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alice, an exchange student in the SAR, hailed the atmosphere of the parade.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's the drumming, all the little kids, everyone's smiling, happy. I like the lion dancers, the dragons. It's really nice, it's a really good day, lots of sun, so it's good fun. I'm staying around till the bun climbing," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Indian tourist Azaira told RTHK the parade was "phenomenal".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It's amazing, something I've never seen. But I think most importantly, it's the effort that everyone has taken to make this day so special," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I know it's Buddha's birthday and the costumes, the time, the effort that's taken to put into this. And of course the walking around in this heat.... I love it."

    'Social worker board vets applications individually'
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of the Social Workers Registration Board has stressed that the statutory body reviews every application on a case-by-case basis, after the government suggested the board might have erred in renewing and approving licences from people who had committed serious crimes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Tuesday, the Executive Council approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers, increasing the amount of appointed members and enabling "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Wednesday said there was an urgency to make legislative amendments, and that there were "very obvious cases" that had deviated from the spirit of the law in the eyes of the public.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Let's say the board approved the renewal of someone who was involved in drug possession or trafficking. I am not saying this is wrong. But it was not reasonable to approve the application, when many people within the Social Workers Registration Board had strong opinions and huge concerns about it," Sun told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, argued on the same programme that people who had done something wrong in the past should be given a second chance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "From the day the board was formed till now, we still review every single application on a case-by-case basis. Even if someone has a criminal record, we will still consider [the application]," Ng said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some people had committed crimes when they were young. But after many years and undergoing social work training, they had reflected and changed... Even among recipients of 'Ten Outstanding Young Persons' were people who had committed crimes like drug possession or trafficking. Does it mean society should not give them the opportunity to change?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The proposed reforms will increase the number of board members from the current 15 to 27, with all required to take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seventeen members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A Tin Shui Wai secondary school says a teacher who failed to return as scheduled on Sunday from a study trip to the mainland came back to Hong Kong the following day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Education Bureau earlier said the teacher in question didn't make it back on May 11 after a four-day mainland study tour to Wuhan for new hires. It said it would require the teacher and the school to submit a report on what happened.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CUHKFAA Thomas Cheung Secondary School said late on Tuesday that the teacher returned to the SAR on the morning of May 12.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school has reported the incident to the incorporated management committee and established an investigation committee to follow up on the matter," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The school is also maintaining close contact with the Education Bureau to learn about and handle the relevant incident. No further comments will be made at this stage."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Internet users had claimed that a secondary school teacher from Hong Kong had been arrested during a trip to Wuhan.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Video sharing platform YouTube, owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday that it will comply with a court ruling and restrict viewing in Hong Kong of 32 banned links related to the song "Glory to Hong Kong", effective immediately.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The action comes after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order last week banning the 2019 protest song.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said the injunction helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry on Tuesday said China is gravely concerned about the prosecution in the UK of three people allegedly working for Hong Kong's intelligence service, and called on Britain to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese in the country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “For some time, the British side has been hyping up the so-called Chinese spying and Chinese cyberattacks," spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “China firmly opposes such despicable acts of political manipulation in the name of justice and national security.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Britain on Tuesday summoned China’s ambassador to the UK to state that espionage and cyberattacks were not acceptable on its soil.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Foreign Office said in a statement that Ambassador Zheng Zeguang had been called to a meeting to be told that “the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyberattacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in London accused Britain of fabricating the charges against the three men.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Zheng said the UK should not interfere in Hong Kong and China's affairs, and should stop making anti-China political provocations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also said Britain should not provide refuge to wanted criminals. (Agencies)

 People are divided over the authorities' move to approve an increase in taxi fares, with some saying the rise is affordable and others complaining about poor taxi services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Executive Council has approved a HK$2 increase in flagfalls, meaning from July 14, the starting fares will be HK$29 for urban taxis, HK$25.5 for New Territories cabs, and HK$24 for Lantau taxis. Incremental charges will also rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A student RTHK spoke to in Kowloon Tong said the fare increase is acceptable. However, he acknowledged that frequent taxi users may not be happy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I am not a frequent user, so I think it is still affordable. But for some people, they may travel quite frequently on taxis. This may be a consideration for them," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A mother who often takes her children by taxi thinks that taxi drivers deserve a higher income for their hard work.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think it's a big deal. I think they deserve more money because they work really hard and very long hours. Life has become more expensive, so we have to also expect that this increase needs to happen for the drivers, right?" she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A passenger said that taxi drivers should improve their services before they are allowed to increase their fares.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The price is a bit high considering their performance. The taxi service is so bad in Hong Kong. Nowadays, we don't have a way to reflect the performance of the taxi drivers. If they behave badly, we don't have a way to complain," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A taxi driver said he's worried that the fare hike could lead to a further drop in passenger numbers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "My concern is that if fares increase, we might see a drop in the number of passengers. Business is already tough, especially during the evening shift when fewer people go out."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 However, another taxi driver believes passengers will find the fare increase acceptable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think it's a reasonable increase. Passengers will eventually get used to it. Considering inflation, a slight rise in taxi fares should be acceptable to them," he said.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Taxi fares are set to go up after the Executive Council approved increases for cabs on Tuesday, but it was far from the jump the trade had asked for.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The industry had suggested a HK$5 increase in the flagfall for urban taxis, and set the initial charges for other cabs at HK$28.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, the flagfall for urban taxis will increase from HK$27 to HK$29, while the starting rates will be HK$25.5 in the New Territories and HK$24 on Lantau.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The incremental charges will also be raised, with a 20-cent increase per metre jump for the first-tier distance after flagfall for urban taxis. Passengers of green and blue cabs will see the incremental rates after flagfall rise from HK$1.7 to HK$1.9.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 For second-tier distances, there will be an increase of 10 cents for all three types of taxis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The new fares are expected to take effect from July 14 after negative vetting by the Legislative Council.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesperson said it is important to review taxi fares to ensure a stable supply of services to cater for passengers' needs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade is facing genuine difficulty in maintaining the financial viability of its operation at the current taxi fare level," a statement read.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The taxi trade hopes that an increase in taxi fares would raise the income of front-line drivers and attract more newcomers to join the industry, while at the same time encouraging taxi operators to improve their services and invest more in new facilities, thereby enhancing the overall taxi service quality and fostering the healthy development of the trade in the long run."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government also noted the approved increases were lower than the levels proposed by the taxi trade, adding the fare hike would “inevitably lead to higher transportation expenses for passengers”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Taxi charges last went up in July 2022.

    Exco endorses plan to reform social worker board
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The Executive Council on Tuesday approved a plan to reform the statutory body overseeing social workers that will change the composition so that appointed members outnumber those elected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on the revamp, Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun said the sector doesn't need to worry about the autonomy of the Social Workers Registration Board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At present, six of the board's 15 members are appointed, eight are elected and there is one official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In future, 17 members will be appointed, eight will be elected and there will be two social welfare officials.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, Sun said governance of the body must be improved because it has deviated from the spirit of the law. He said, for example, the board had appointed to its disciplinary body a social worker who was facing a charge of rioting.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun told reporters on Tuesday that in future, all board members must take an oath of allegiance to the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The board exercises public authority. What this means is that the registration of Hong Kong's 27,000 social workers, the disciplinary hearings involving them, all these are to do with public authority," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "So requiring members of a statutory body exercising such authority to swear allegiance, this is only natural. It will ensure that members can safeguard our national security and that they uphold the Basic Law and bear allegiance to the SAR government."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun said at least 14 of the 27 members of the board in future will be social workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everyone needs to understand that the source of social workers should actually be diverse. Some of them would be elected, others would be appointed," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The diversity at the board means that some of the social workers might be renowned professors, some might be respected leaders at social welfare organisations. This would allow for the board's operations to be more diverse and balanced."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that the board will also be tasked with setting continuing professional development requirements for the sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government added in a statement that the relevant legal changes, if passed by lawmakers, will enable "the prompt removal" of social workers convicted of serious offences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said the proposed legal changes will be gazetted on Friday, with a bill to be tabled to the legislature on May 22.

    'HK keen to promote global cooperation for prosperity'

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Executive Council convenor Regina Ip on Tuesday said that Hong Kong is well-positioned to promote global collaboration and contribute to world prosperity, as the city kicked off its first-ever conference with a focus on geopolitics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at the inaugural “Global Prosperity Summit 2024”, Ip warned that Hong Kong faces a “high degree of global geopolitical risks” due to the looming threats of “rising polarisation and political violence”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said these threats were challenging global governance, and have led to protectionist policies of tariff hikes, financial sanctions and export controls to “deny developing countries’ access to advanced technology”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The world is being factored into opposing geopolitical blocks, the free trade and investment environment over the past decades, which have helped hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, seems to belong to a bygone era,” Ip said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “With national elections in 64 countries, affecting 49 percent of the world’s population, taking place this year, politics seems to trump economics everywhere,” she added, noting that signs of polarisation and political violence were also on the rise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ip said Hong Kong has a keen interest in promoting ways to resolve such issues, as it is a small but open economy that has a high degree of exposure to global risks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We are a very international and cosmopolitan society, and we are very well-connected. We understand the cultures and political systems of mainland China as well as the culture and systems of the West, so we are well positioned, really, to maximise our role as a super connector and an intermediary between mainland China and the rest of the world,” she told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Ip told RTHK’s Hong Kong Today programme the SAR is a very suitable place to host the prosperity summit given its reputation as a meeting point between East and West.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “This summit showcases Hong Kong as a platform for international dialogue and communication, because we are able to bring together experts, prominent scholars, former senior officials from all over the world to debate on the issues,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “When we have a free trade investment environment, everybody benefits, and we don’t want this to stop,” she added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The three-day summit event is sponsored by local businesses and the government and is co-hosted by the think tank Savantas Policy Institute which Ip chairs, covering topics such as de-globalisation, technological cooperation and climate change.

    Advances in imaging tech gives hope to stroke patients

Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1753099_1_20240514114851.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A study from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on Tuesday showed that more than a third of stroke patients who were treated beyond the traditional six-hour golden period had recovered well, offering hope to those once thought untreatable.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The researchers studied more than 50 stroke patients who were treated beyond six hours, with the most notable case being a patient who was treated 22 hours after his stroke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 One of the HKU researchers, Associate Professor of Surgery Kevin Cheng, explained that the key to this medical breakthrough lies in advances in imaging technology, which now allows doctors to assess the proportion of brain cells that can be saved, enabling more targeted interventions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "In the past, if we just base on a plain CT scan, we cannot estimate the area of the brain having damage. We can just see if there is any blood," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But with the advancement in the CT perfusion, we can differentiate...which part of the brain is still salvageable and the total volume and the mismatch ratio. So these factors are very accurate and can help us to accurately differentiate those patients who can benefit."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Acute ischaemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. Brain cells can quickly die while the flow of oxygen and nutrients is restricted, leading to loss of brain function, paralysis, speech problems and even death.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) on Tuesday said the SAR saw 3.4 million visitor arrivals in April – a 17 percent increase year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said provisional figures show about 2.5 million of the arrivals, or 73 percent, were from the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said there was an increase of more than 50 percent in arrivals from other countries compared to April last year, with a more than 80 percent rise from Indonesia, driven by the end of Ramadan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, visitor arrivals from long-haul markets such as the US and Canada increased by more than 80 percent year-on-year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The HKTB said about 14.6 million visitor arrivals were recorded in the first four months of the year, which was double the figure from the same period in 2023.

    Interfering with HK's trade offices will backfire: CE
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday warned that any attempt to interfere with the legitimate operations of Hong Kong’s Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) would only end up harming the economies of the countries that take such action.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He was speaking after a manager of the government’s ETO in London, Bill Yuen, was arrested with two others on suspicion of breaching Britain's national security law and charged with assisting Hong Kong intelligence officers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to interfere with the work of the ETOs in different places will be against free trade and free economy, and will be harming the economy of the countries that try to do bad things to the operation of the ETOs," Lee said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He told reporters that the duties of the trade offices are to liaise with foreign officials, businesses, think tanks and representatives of various sectors, to boost links and promote the economic and trade interests of the SAR.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Any attempt to make unwarranted allegations against the SAR government is unacceptable," the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The ETOs will of course pursue their duties full-heartedly and legitimately."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also noted that the the Chinese Embassy in Britain has made serious representations to UK officials, while the SAR government is still waiting for British authorities to respond to its demand for more information on the allegations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR has accused Britain of arbitrarily arresting Chinese citizens and slandering the Hong Kong government, saying this violates the principles of international law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also said a photo of him and Yuen that is circulating online was taken more than two decades ago to mark their graduation from the Australian School of Policing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE said that is the only impression he has of Yuen.

    Tourists from 8 mainland cities to get HK$200 vouchers
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Tourists hailing from eight mainland cities will be welcomed with HK$200 vouchers for restaurants and shops, Chief Executive John Lee said on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last week, the central government added eight new cities, including Urumqi, Hohhot and Heilongjiang to the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), allowing residents to travel to the SAR without joining a tour group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking ahead of the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said he expects visitors from the eight cities to provide a large boost to Hong Kong's tourism sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The IVS is the main source of tourists for Hong Kong. It contributed 60 percent of all mainland tourist arrivals last year. The eight cities come with large populations and they also have significant economic growth, with high spending power," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The eight cities are located in the north, northwest and northeast of China respectively. They are further away from Hong Kong, when compared with the other cities under the IVS. This will bring in a lot of overnight visitors, largely increase per capita spending, and revenues from tourism and related sectors will increase exponentially."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee said the authorities have a series of measures to attract more tourists, including the HK$200 vouchers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that a drone show at the weekend received rave reviews.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Our purpose is to let locals and visitors feel the joy, when they participate in these activities. We hope to use activities to bring liveliness, and use liveliness to bring more money," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Three people were injured on Monday after a sightseeing helicopter to Mount Aso, an active volcano in Japan, needed to make an emergency landing due to an engine failure mid-flight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A Japanese pilot and two Hong Kong tourists were on tour to the Aso Nakadake Crater in Kumamoto prefecture, when the incident occurred at noon during its return to base.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The helicopter's engine failed and an emergency landing was made on a grassy field near the mountainous area, where all three were sent conscious to hospital for treatment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Immigration Department has followed up on the case with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Consulate in Fukuoka to provide assistance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Education Bureau on Tuesday said a secondary school teacher failed to return to Hong Kong after taking part in a four-day mainland study tour last week, following claims online that the educator was arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 An online forum post suggested that a teacher of a subsidised school in Tin Shui Wai was picked up by mainland authorities while on a trip to Wuhan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau said a mainland study tour for new teachers in Wuhan, which was held between May 8 and 11, wrapped up as scheduled, but it was notified that one member could not return to the SAR along with the group.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Education Bureau attaches great importance to the discipline of participating teachers, and has required the school submit a report. The bureau will also comprehensively review relevant information and handle the case seriously. No further comments will be made at this stage," it said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The bureau will maintain close contact with the school and continue to follow up on the incident."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Education authorities also said teachers participating in mainland study tours must depart and return to Hong Kong as scheduled, and that they are reminded to be careful with their words and actions and to be law-abiding.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Any cases of professional misconduct would be strictly followed up in accordance with the established mechanism, the bureau added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 RTHK has reached out to the school in question for comment.

    Weightlifting body chair remarks unacceptable: govt

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The culture, sports and tourism minister, Kevin Yeung, on Monday said it was unacceptable that repeated mistakes were made by the chairwoman of the city's weightlifting and powerlifting body.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also called on Josephine Ip of the Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association to publicly address her mistakes.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It is unacceptable for the same mistakes to happen over and over. We hope that the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China can come up with a long-term solution so that similar incidents won't happen again," Yeung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because in both instances the chairwoman was at fault, she should explain to the public herself."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association had apologised for a remark made by Ip during a competition on May 6. The event featured competitors from 13 countries along with the SAR and Chinese Taipei, and Ip said it had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her remark drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The sports body explained the chairwoman made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence while giving a speech at the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On another occasion, she described Hong Kong as a "relatively small country", which the association said was a "slip of the tongue".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said the administration would take appropriate action based on findings of the investigation to ensure people speaking on behalf of a sports association or the sector understood that every single word is very important.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China, for its part, said it is reviewing the report submitted by the weightlifting and powerlifting body and would keep in contact with the government how to handle the matter.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 London's Metropolitan Police on Monday said three men were charged with allegedly assisting Hong Kong intelligence services and with foreign interference.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The men have appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged under Britain's National Security Act.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chi Leung Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, have each been charged with assisting a foreign intelligence service. They were not asked to enter any pleas to the charges and will next appear in court on May 24. All three men were granted bail.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Seven men and one woman who were not charged were released from custody, police added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Chinese Embassy in the UK said it has made serious representations to UK officials over the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK’s fabrication of the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the HKSAR government," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR Government said it had "demanded the UK Government to provide full details of relevant information of the alleged matter concerned, and the latter's response is awaited".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The duties of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London are to maintain close liaison with interlocutors in the local government, business, think tanks and various sectors, with a view to enriching bilateral ties in different areas such as trade, investment, arts and culture, enhancing local people and enterprises' knowledge of Hong Kong's unique strengths, and promoting the economic and trade interests of Hong Kong," it said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It said it had demanded that London "fairly handle the matter, effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office's Office Manager who was alleged to be involved, and ensure that the normal work of the Economic and Trade Office is not affected".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 London police said a total of 11 people had been detained earlier this month, nearly all of whom were arrested in the Yorkshire area in northern England.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A police spokesman said, “this investigation remains ongoing, but now that charges have been brought, I urge people not to speculate or comment further in relation to this case.” (Agencies)

 Police on Monday said they arrested 34 people for allegedly operating electric bikes and scooters without a licence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The suspects, aged between 19 and 69, were also charged with offences such as driving unlicensed vehicles and using them on pavements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers added that they seized 34 electric bikes and scooters in various areas in the New Territories, such as Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Lok Ma Chau, in a two-day operation last week.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, senior inspector Ngai Siu-Cheong reminded people not to use unlicensed electric vehicles on public roads.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Anyone using unregistered and unlicensed electric vehicles on the road may be in violation of the Road Users' Code and other relevant laws. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty includes a fine of HK$10,000 and 12-month imprisonment," he said.

    Take care of ethnic minority Chinese tourists too: DAB
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong's tourism industry should learn to be more accommodating to ethnic minority travellers from the mainland, DAB lawmakers said on Monday, after the central government announced it was adding eight more cities to the individual visit scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From May 27, residents from eight more cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmaker Kennedy Wong pointed out the expansion meant more mainland visitors who are from ethnic minority communities coming to Hong Kong, including Mongolians, Zhuang people, and Hui people, and that the SAR had to be prepared to welcome them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Hong Kong's tourism industry, and actually every one of us here, should be more accommodating and should be more understanding towards the minority travellers' needs. For example, for Muslims and for Mongolians, they have their eating habits and they also have their own culture," Wong said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Some of these minority travellers probably prefer their own languages. Apart from the ability to speak Putonghua, perhaps in some signage and some areas we also need to display their languages too."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Starry Lee, another DAB legislator and also Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, urged officials to consider arranging more direct flights from those mainland cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There are currently direct flights from just four of these newly added cities – Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lee also renewed calls for Beijing to raise the duty-free goods allowance for mainland tourists from 5,000 to 30,000 yuan per person for each trip, while capping the amount at 200,000 yuan.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun said on Monday there was "nothing political" about him saying the governance of the statutory body overseeing social workers must be improved, and that the motivation was about raising the sector's professional standards.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Last Friday, he wrote on social media accusing the Social Workers Registration Board of ignoring society's overall interests, damaging the professionalism and credibility of the sector by deviating from the spirit of the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Specifically, he wrote that the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications of people who'd committed serious offences in the past, while approving a social worker facing a rioting charge to join its disciplinary committee panel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The minister said improvements must be made to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, the board has 15 members - eight of whom are elected, with six appointed and an official from the Social Welfare Department.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking to reporters, Sun didn't say whether the government plans to appoint more members to the board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it would announce its reform package once it's ready.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also dismissed an argument from the board's chairman, Ng Yut-ming, that the minister had misunderstandings regarding how the board operates.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "There's no misunderstanding - I have complete information about what's going on in the board," the minister said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Social welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said he hopes the board won't become a political battlefield.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tik said that if the government decides to go ahead and add more appointed members, he hoped it wouldn’t be because it wanted to gain the majority of the board and exert greater influence.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lawmaker also proposed that future appointed members be nominated or recommended by universities or professional bodies as they'd be considered impartial.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If you want to improve the registration board, it has to include the element of professionalism," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I suggest that the scholars from the universities or members of the professional body would increase the content and element of professionalism. I also imagine it will be more easily accepted by our professional sector."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tik hoped that officials would consult social workers regarding the reform proposal in future.

    Community living rooms to open in summer: Chris Sun
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and welfare minister Chris Sun on Monday said he hopes the community living rooms in To Kwa Wan, Hung Hom and Nam Cheong would open by the end of the summer holidays, as part of efforts to help the newly identified 950,000 people for targeted poverty alleviation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a Legco panel meeting, Sun hoped the three facilities, aimed at providing support for grassroots families, would be able to serve residents in summer after undergoing outfitting works.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmaker Connie Lam asked whether there were plans to expand the shared-space project to more districts to help more people living in poor conditions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Apart from subdivided unit households, people living in cages or caged homes and cubicles also need these kind of community living rooms. There are a lot of such kinds of residential developments in Sha Tin, in Lohas Park in Tseung Kwan O, there are also subdivided units…Will the government expand the programme to other districts?” she asked.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, Sun said it’s not easy for the government to identify locations for these living rooms.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Subdivided unit households are concentrated in urban areas and as a result it's difficult for the government to identify a venue to establish a community living room. That is why we have to rely on the business sector to identify such a venue for us,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the same meeting, lawmakers also questioned whether a new framework for poverty measurement could reflect the actual poverty situation and target underprivileged groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation. It will no longer use median household income to define poverty.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Welfare sector lawmaker Tik Chi-yuen said officials shouldn’t scrap the poverty line because it can keep the public informed about the impoverished population.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Of course, the poverty line is contentious elsewhere in the world, but the poverty line works in two ways — we can tell the trend; we can see whether the impoverished population is growing or shrinking. The poverty line can also help us keep an eye on the performance of the government,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The welfare chief responded by saying the government had been putting a lot of resources into poverty alleviation through various social welfare programmes.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The DAB on Monday called on the government to clarify its revised rules on employment agencies, saying they were unclear.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The party's comments came after the Labour Department released a revised code of practice last week which aims to discourage domestic helpers from "job hopping", and to safeguard consumer rights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking at a press briefing, DAB lawmaker Frankie Ngan urged authorities to better stipulate the measure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The DAB requests the government to do more promotion and education for the agencies, especially as it is a new regulation for them," he said
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Could the government implement the instruction for the employer and the employee at the same time to make sure that they deeply understand the new regulation for the agency and the new agreement?"
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ngan also called on the government to limit the borrowing capacity of foreign domestic helpers, as he and other DAB party members have received complaints from employers who are frustrated by lenders who pursue the money that helpers failed to pay back before departing from Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We request the government [to] make a financial credit database for those financial institutes to see [how much a] particular domestic helper borrowed," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We request the government to consider, [to] set an upper limit for the borrowing loan to the domestic helpers."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The DAB also suggested the government introduce a tax reduction scheme for people hiring foreign domestic helpers to reduce their burden on arranging health checks and training classes for the helpers.

    Divided views on direct flights for mainland visitors

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Representatives of the retail and hotel industries on Monday praised the move to boost Hong Kong's tourism sector by adding eight mainland cities to the individual visit scheme, but views were divided on whether direct flights from those cities were necessary.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From May 27, travellers from Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Hohhot of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin in Heilongjiang, Lhasa in Tibet, Lanzhou in Gansu, Xining in Qinghai, Yinchuan in Ningxia, and Urumqi in Xinjiang will be able to visit Hong Kong on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, there are direct flights from just four cities - Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi, with airlines planning to add Harbin next month.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alan Chan from the Miramar Group, which owns two hotels in the city, said travellers from further afield tend to spend more money, adding that tourists from the eight cities would be a big boost to the tourism sector here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Visitors from those eight places will be the most wealthy people there...there are rich people in every city. For example, Shanxi doesn't have a very strong economy but there are bosses who own coal businesses there," the group's chief operations officer told an RTHK programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said with a new road which links Shenzhen airport and Shenzhen Bay opening next month, it would be convenient for mainland travellers to come to the SAR even if there are no direct flights.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But Liberal Party legislator Peter Shiu, who represents the retail sector, said businesses here would get a greater boost if there are direct flights from all eight cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If tourists fly to Hong Kong directly, they would spend the night here during their trip. But if they fly to Shenzhen first and then come to Hong Kong, will they spend some time in Shenzhen before visiting us, or come to Hong Kong during the day and spend the night in Shenzhen?" he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have to think about this because usually tourists who stay the night here spend more money than those who don't."

    HA looks to make it easier to add new medicines

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) said it is seeking to streamline the process for adding new drugs to its registry, with a view to cut half the time needed to obtain the medicines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, drug companies write to clinical doctors directly in the application, and it takes around 10 months before a drug could be added to the HA's formulary.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The authority’s cluster services director, Simon Tang, said officials are trying to cut the red tape by having companies write to its headquarters, saving front-line doctors time and effort.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said patient groups and public doctors are among stakeholders officials will speak to, saying he hopes they can work out a proposal in the coming months.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We need to get our colleagues involved, and of course, another key stakeholder would be the pharmaceutical companies," Tang told reporters.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Through the streamlining, we're confident that the introduction of new drugs to the HA drug formulary can be shortened by half."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In November last year, the government introduced a new mechanism called "1+" for new drug registrations, for products treating severe diseases that are backed by local clinical data.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A new drug can now be registered in the SAR if just one drug regulatory authority in the world has approved it, rather than the previous two authorities, before local experts and regulators approve it.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tang said the HA had so far asked drug companies to try to register two drugs for treating cancer through the new mechanism, and said he understood that the government itself had received around 100 enquiries on the matter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that if the safety-proving clinical data for the new product is from the mainland or Hong Kong that could better ensure its effectiveness, because sometimes drugs approved in other continents may not have similar effects or side-effects for Asians.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The doctor noted that mainland drug regulators were one of four authorities added to the list of regulatory bodies in recent years.

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Mainland students studying in Hong Kong have been urged to be vigilant as more of them are being targeted by phone scammers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Senior inspector Eddie Lam said there were 39 cases of mainland students falling victim to fake-official ruses in the first quarter of this year, up from 29 cases during the same period last year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We discovered that scammers are targeting mainlanders who are studying in Hong Kong. We found that the number of reports by mainland students increased rapidly in April," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam said students, especially those from the mainland, should be extra vigilant.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 From January to March, phone-scam victims lost a total of HK$789 million, almost four times more than the amount swindled during the same period last year.

    Hongkongers zone out as they compete to do nothing

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Around a hundred Hongkongers who’ve mastered the art of doing nothing on Sunday gathered at the Cha Kwo Ling Promenade for a zoning out contest.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The “Chill and Relax Festival” is jointly organised by the Development Bureau, the Harbourfront Commission and the Playground Association to raise awareness over the importance of mental health.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Participants were advised to stay still, and must not fall asleep or check their phones during the hour-long tournament. Their heart rates were measured regularly, and the person with the lowest and most stable heart rate would win.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Kelvin, a laboratory worker, described the challenge as “a piece of cake”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “A whole hour is nothing. I normally can do nothing for a few hours daily, so I think it is not that challenging. Practice makes perfect,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Moris, a university student, said he was there to take a break from his studies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Just to relax, honestly… because I completed my semester. I think [I am here] just for this atmosphere because it shows some, it's a symbol for difference, like the traditional China culture or the Buddha,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Winnie, who joined the event with a group of hiking friends, said the occasion was perfect for Hongkongers to relax.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The majority of Hongkongers are always stressed out. So having some time to relax like this competition will be better,” she told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The top three candidates got an Apple Watch, Airpods and a HK$500 shopping coupon respectively.

 Police on Sunday said a mainland man died after falling from Lion Rock.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers said they received a report at around noon, that the 37-year-old man was engaging in rock climbing before the fall.

 The Government Flying Service sent the man to Eastern Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Celebrations are underway across Hong Kong on Sunday to mark Mother's Day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some restaurants RTHK spoke to said they logged a jump in business, as families flocked out to celebrate the day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Others, meanwhile, bought flowers as a show of love and appreciation for their mothers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "By giving her flowers, I would say thank you to my mom for taking care of me over the years and helping me," 11-year-old Alex said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Some tourists said they were quite impressed with the festivities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mrs Wong, a tourist from Singapore, said people in Hong Kong appear to be more excited about Mother's Day compared to her home country.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I think the culture here in Hong Kong is pretty interesting. It's a bit different from Singapore, because I do see a lot of people carrying flowers around, so it's a bit different. So, I think they place more emphasis in Hong Kong,” she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Another visitor from Shenzhen, Mr Tien, said he and his family are here for a day trip to mark the occasion.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We come to Hong Kong for traveling and shopping, and brought our kid to walk around," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Chief Executive John Lee wished all mothers joy and happiness on this special day.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The CE also posted a photo of himself and a colleague preparing flowers for "the two great mothers" in his life – namely his own mother and his wife – for the sacrifices they've made for his family.

    'Improve working conditions to retain public nurses'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government's plan to allow non-locally trained nurses to practise in Hong Kong without taking a licensing exam has its drawbacks, a lawmaker and a nursing professor said on Sunday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Instead, they said it's more important to take away administrative work from existing local nurses at public hospitals and recognise their specialty to retain staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Currently, non-locally trained nurses must pass the licensing examination administered by the Nursing Council of Hong Kong to be a qualified practitioner here.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But under the government’s proposal which has been submitted to Legco for scrutiny, those trained outside of the city could come through a special registration pathway and obtain a full license, without taking the exam, after having worked “satisfactorily and competently” during a specified period in the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Marking the International Nurses Day, DAB lawmaker Edward Leung noted that the attrition rate for nurses in the public sector reached 9.5 percent in 2023-24, saying the government must improve working conditions to keep staff.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said it’s important to reduce their administrative burden and ensure their pay is on par with the private sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said while the plan to admit non-locally trained nurses could help alleviate manpower shortage at public hospitals in the longer run, it could add to the workload of local nurses in the initial phase.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "When we invite them to Hong Kong, in the very first period, we have to assign local nurses to assist them on doing their jobs and providing services. For this period, we are drawing manpower to assist the non-local nurses," Leung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 William Li, vice-president of the Hong Kong Academy of Nursing, said the proposed special registration would only be a temporary measure to alleviate manpower shortage in the public sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The most important way is to offer recognition to those nurses who have specialty experience or specialty nursing qualification," Li said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Eventually, their job satisfaction should be improved and more nurses would be happy to stay at public hospitals."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Li also said offering more training spots for aspiring nurses at local institutions could be another way to alleviate manpower shortage.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan on Sunday said an expansion of the individual travellers scheme will bring more overnight tourists to the SAR, adding that more will be done to boost spending and attract visitors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He made the remarks a day after Beijing announced that people from eight more mainland cities – including Hohhot of Inner Mongolia, Lhasa of Tibet, and Urumqi of Xinjiang – will be able to visit Hong Kong without joining tour groups.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This brings the total number of cities under the solo travel scheme to 59.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on his weekly blog, Chan said the move will stimulate the economy and improve cultural ties between the SAR and the mainland.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The SAR government and residents are deeply grateful to the central government for their support of Hong Kong. The move will encourage more visitors to stay overnight, boosting the local catering, retail, and hotel sectors," he wrote.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This will help our economy and improve the cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The finance chief also vowed to do more to lure talent to the city, and bring in more foreign capital.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Despite the external challenges like rising geopolitical tensions and a high interest rate environment, Chan said he’s confident that Hong Kong’s economy will continue to expand with the staunch backing of the central authorities.

    'Glory to HK' ban helps define red line: Paul Lam
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Justice Secretary Paul Lam on Sunday said an injunction over the 2019 protest song "Glory to Hong Kong" helps define the red line and provides a stronger deterrence against those who would use the song as a tool to promote "Hong Kong independence".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a radio programme days after the Court of Appeal granted a temporary injunction order banning the song, Lam said the court has made it very clear what is allowed and what’s not.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The purpose of this injunction was made very clear by the court. Using this song to incite seditious acts is illegal. It will definitely increase the public's awareness of this behaviour. What are the benefits? They are to provide a stronger deterrence and a prevention, and to make everyone understand what can and can't be done," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice chief said authorities had asked internet service providers such as Google to take down the song and are awaiting their response, adding that Google had said earlier that it would remove the song upon a court order.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I believe everyone is very anxious and hope that [the internet service providers] will take actual action to respond as quickly as possible. Do they really follow the company’s policy [to align with court orders]? Do they really keep their word?" he questioned.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Lam said he hopes to see Hong Kong develop into a “food court” for legal services, catering not only for the needs of international companies, but also of grassroots citizens.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The justice minister added that officials will continue to boost the city’s role as a mediation and arbitration centre.

    Weightlifting body apologises over chairwoman remarks

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association says chairwoman Josephine Ip will be more cautious to ensure similar incidents won't happen again." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752825_1_20240512105507.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The city's weightlifting and powerlifting body has apologised for an earlier remark made by its chairwoman which the government said was a suspected violation of the one-China principle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hong Kong, China Weightlifting and Powerlifting Association also said Josephine Ip made the blunder with the intention of simplifying a long sentence when giving a speech on May 6.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the opening ceremony of the Asian Equipped Powerlifting Championship and the Asian University Cup, Ip mentioned that the event, which featured competitors from the SAR and Chinese Taipei, had "lifters and officials from 13 countries".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her remarks drew condemnation from the administration on Friday, which called Ip's remarks "absolutely unacceptable".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The statement is grossly inconsistent with the fact that delegations from Hong Kong, China and Chinese Taipei participated as regional teams. It gives rise to suspected violation of the one-China principle," a government spokesperson said in a statement.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response, the sports body explained that there were initially competitors from 16 countries and regions, but ultimately only representatives from 13 nations and two regions participated in the event.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "During her speech, chairwoman Ip found that the script did not match the actual number of participating teams. She also felt that the sentence was too long. So she simplified the sentence to 'this time, we have lifters and officials from 13 countries'," the association said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "She mistakenly omitted 'regions' and created misunderstanding. This was a serious oversight."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The association also said the speech did not mean to imply "Hong Kong independence", and that it firmly supports and upholds the Basic Law and the one-China principle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The chairwoman will be more cautious and will review public speeches before giving them to ensure similar incidents won't happen again, the association added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The powerlifting and weightlifting association has submitted a report to the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China on Saturday.

 Police on Saturday arrested a 32-year-old man in Yuen Long on suspicion of murdering his 50-year-old father.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers were called to a flat on Ping Fai Path shortly after 1am on reports that a man had collapsed. The victim was rushed to unconscious to Pok Oi Hospital with head injuries and was declared dead at about 2.30am.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Officers said initial investigations indicated that the victim had a dispute with his son, during which he was attacked. Police arrested a suspect at the scene. He was detained for inquiries.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Both the father and son are said to be non-ethnic Chinese. A post-mortem is to take place to determine the cause of death. The Yuen Long district crime squad is investigating.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government on Saturday condemned a report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a statement, the administration said the commission’s “so-called ‘2023 Annual Report’ ... made biased, slandering and smearing remarks against the situation in the HKSAR”.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The SAR government rejected the report’s comments on safeguarding national security; the administration of justice and rule of law; safeguarding of rights and freedoms and reform of the district councils.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesperson said: “The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and making unfounded and fact-twisting remarks. Such attempt to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance is doomed to fail.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On calls in the report for sanctions on SAR officials, judges and prosecutors, the spokesperson added: “The so-called 'sanctions' as mentioned in the US' so-called report is a smack of despicable political manipulation to intimidate the HKSAR officials safeguarding national security.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “These grossly interfere in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs, and violate the international law and the basic norms governing international relations.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On calls for the SAR’s economic and trade offices in the US to lose their certification, the spokesperson added: “The HKSAR Government despised the hypocrisy and barbaric act of US politicians driven only by their own political gains, fabricating groundless excuses, and attacking the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices' legitimate and rational economic and trade promotion activities.”
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The statement says the SAR government will “steadfastly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Large crowds of visitors and locals flocked to the Wan Chai waterfront on Saturday for the first in a series of spectacular drone shows put on by the Tourism Board.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About one thousand drones took flight at 8pm for the ten-minute spectacular, which is designed to tie in with the Buddha's Birthday public holiday and the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, both of which fall on Wednesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The drones soared up to sixty metres into the air, creating a pattern in the shape of the famous bun hill which is the centrepiece of the Cheung Chau festival's highlight, the bun-scrambling competition. They also formed the shape of what organisers called a "giant peaceful bun" some 30 metres in diameter.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Many of the spectators captured the moment on their smartphones and cameras.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Other shapes adopted included lions and temples to signify good luck.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And visitors to the show were also in luck: for those waiting to enjoy the drones, there was free ice cream at the Wan Chai Ferry Pier.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Beijing has expanded an individual travel scheme, allowing more mainland travelers to to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752749_1_20240511150955.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday welcomed the news that the central government is adding eight more mainland cities, all provincial capitals, to a solo traveller scheme that will allow more mainland residents from remote areas to visit Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This came as Beijing announced that eight more cities, namely Taiyuan of Shanxi province, Hohhot of Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Harbin of Heilongjiang, Lhasa of Tibet, Lanzhou of Gansu, Xining of Qinghai, Yinchuan of Ningxia, and Urumqi of Xinjiang, will be covered under the “Individual Visit Scheme” - bringing the total number of cities under the scheme to 59.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The scheme allows travellers from the mainland to visit and stay in Hong Kong and Macau on an individual basis, instead of on tour groups, for no more than seven days at a time. Residents from the eight cities could apply to visit the SARs from May 27th.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “All these eight mainland provincial capitals have huge populations and strong economic growth, and are cities with high levels of consumption,” the chief executive said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Such a further expansion means that all mainland provincial capitals are now covered under the scheme, and it will significantly help revive the economic activities of the city’s tourism, retail, catering, and hospitality sectors, while promoting the two-way exchanges between residents from Hong Kong and these provincial capitals,” he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, the city’s tourism chief, Kevin Yeung, said the SAR will soon ramp up tourism promotion works in these cities, and launch new tour routes and products to woo travellers - in the face of changing tourism patterns.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “In May and June alone, a series of large-scale events are scheduled in Hong Kong, including the Cheung Chau Bun Festival, Buddha’s Birthday Carnival, Le French May, Chinese Culture Festival, as well as the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “We look forward to having more visitors from different cities to explore Hong Kong in depth,” he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Timothy Chui, the executive director of Hong Kong Tourism Association, said these eight cities aren't the largest mainland cities, but are growing strongly and their residents could be enticed by the SAR's vibrant retail sector.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Residents from these cities may well not have travelled much outside their regions, so there's more of a chance they could have higher demand in terms of travelling [to other regions] or for shopping,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu agreed about the consumer potential from the eight mainland cities, noting that most of these cities have an average per capita GDP of 100,000 yuan.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he warned that the SAR must provide more transport routes to these regions to spur tourism growth.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Even if we don't have direct flights to these cities yet, they can use the high-speed rail to travel here, [but] this could push us to open up more airline routes with these cities. Some airlines have already been doing that,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Beijing earlier expanded the scheme in February to add tourists from Xian and Qingdao.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The latest expansion came just two days after Xia Baolong, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Office, told the city’s tourism chief that Hong Kong must further tap into the city’s rich tourism resources to revitalise offerings amid “profound changes” in the tourism industry.

    KMB won't rule out applying for fare hike

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) on Saturday said it's not ruling out applying for a fare hike this year, after operating costs rose.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The higher costs also included its investment in electric buses, with a new batch of electric double-decker buses beginning a phased roll-out on Saturday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the franchised bus operator called for more government subsidies, saying it's incurred higher costs from its spending on electric buses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The company said earlier that it wouldn't rule out seeking a fare hike, but Kenny Kan, head of the company's corporate communications and public affairs department, stressed that the increased costs from electric buses were just one factor in this. .
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Costs - whether fuel or labour - have increased. As a bus operator, our fiscal robustness and sustainability is very important," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If we think there's a need, we'll definitely apply for a fare hike... But in terms of how much the hike would be, we would consider the issue of affordability."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The KMB imported 52 electric double-decker buses, and 44 are currently in service.

    Scheme finds more residents with chronic diseases
   </title>
   <link>
    https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1752734-20240511.htm

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 A government-led primary healthcare scheme has found that about 40 percent of participants who took part in screenings for chronic diseases were diagnosed with pre-diabetes, myelitis, and hypertension, 10 percent more than expected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Speaking on a Commercial Radio programme, Pang Fei-chau, commissioner for primary healthcare in the Health Bureau, said the authorities have commissioned the University of Hong Kong to study the issue and come up with measures to remedy the situation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Based on the previous population health survey as well as our internal data analysis, [what] we've anticipated about 30 percent, but we had 40 percent [of] people who have this diagnosis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said this was the reason that officials wanted academics in Hong Kong to look into the matter, Pang said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 His remarks came as he noted that about 20,000 people had been screened under the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme - out of a total of 35,000 residents who have signed up for the scheme’s body checks, which was more than expected.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said most of the participants were aged between 45 and 64, and the majority were female. Pang hoped more males could also join the scheme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Sometimes, if you ignore healthy lifestyles, it's a contributing factor to the high prevalence of chronic diseases,” Pang again stressed, adding that they will enhance health education at district health centres as well as companies that have more male staff, such as the MTR where 80 percent of staff are males.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The commissioner also noted that over 500 doctors have participated in the scheme so far, 100 more than when the scheme was first launched.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said 70 percent of them are charging less than the HK$150 maximum co-payment fee that the government had suggested.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The scheme, which was launched last November, aims to ramp up screening services at the grassroots level, prevent chronic diseases at an early stage, and encourage more “family doctors” to join in to provide personalised primary health care.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Pang said the development of these schemes may involve new partnership models between the public and private sectors.

    'Winter and summer flu seasons may be linking up'

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician warned on Saturday that the winter and summer flu seasons may be merging, given the rising number of cases.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mike Kwan from the University of Hong Kong's Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine said the flu season may not end.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The number of cases is still increasing. We don't know when the situation will stabilise or even when the numbers will drop. We expect the summer flu season to start soon, so the winter and summer flu seasons may be coming together," he told a radio programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Four children had died after contracting influenza, and Kwan said many such cases were complicated with encephalopathy, and their situations could worsen in a matter of hours.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said the condition could only be alleviated by using drugs like steroids, but the best prevention was to get a flu jab.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Photo Caption: Christine Choi (left) says Hong Kong is a good place for international students to better connect with the Greater Bay Area." referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752724_1_20240511103501.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Education Secretary Christine Choi said Hong Kong's quality education can attract international talent and boost the city's competitiveness.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During an interview on RTHK's Your Home Address, Choi highlighted the presence of five Hong Kong universities in the top 100 global rankings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have to make good use of these advantages to enhance our competitiveness while attracting more quality talent to Hong Kong," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We nurture more of our students with [an] international or global perspective and also expand our talent pool."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The lack of language barriers was one of these advantages. Choi said universities taught in English, providing a welcoming learning environment for international students.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She added that students had an opportunity to learn Chinese, enabling them to better connect with the Greater Bay Area.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Choi added that the SAR attracted respected scholars from around the world to teach and carry out research in Hong Kong, further boosting the city's academic standing.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She also said that at the local level, the authorities and schools have worked to enhance students' learning experiences.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They encourage schools to organise overseas trips so students can interact with their peers outside Hong Kong and gain valuable experience through exchange programmes, she said.

    Govt helping buildings improve fire safety: Mak

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs Alice Mak on Saturday said the Legislative Council is reviewing the Building Management Ordinance, to urge tenants to carry out renovation work, especially for old buildings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Her comments came after five people died in a fire last month in a building with substandard fire safety equipment.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mak told an RTHK radio programme that some buildings might find it difficult to get tenants to attend a general meeting, and the renovation charges might cause disagreements.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said the city had many old buildings - especially in districts like Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po and Kowloon City - and the government is reaching out to help tenants.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The Home Affairs Department has been actively assisting and helping the owners of the corporation to reach consensus among their tenants to carry out necessary repairs to maintain their building, to make sure that they will observe all the building's safety and fire safety requirements," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mak added that the authorities had proposed under the amendment of the Building Management Ordinance that at least five percent of owners, or 100 owners, should vote in person for large-scale maintenance work.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A horticulture therapy programme at North Lantau Hospital has helped to boost the confidence and mood of dementia patients.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 About 60 patients with mild to moderate levels of dementia have taken part in the project so far.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 During the programme, lasting six to eight weeks, participants performed simple tasks such as planting seeds and learned about different plant species.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 More complicated activities include repotting plants in the hospital's rehabilitation garden.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Occupational therapist Doris Cheung said some patients had been reluctant to join the programme.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "They usually think 'I can't do it, I'm useless'. But by the activities, they can understand that they have ability to try, they have ability to do the things they can do," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "At the beginning, they need assistance...but we teach them step-by-step, and then they learn what's the procedure needed for planting, and how to repot the plants, how the plants grow, and then they can document it according to our supervision or guidance."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheung acknowledged there's no scientific proof that such therapy can slow down the progression of dementia, but patients who took part said they were happier and more confident.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We think the nature of [slowing down] the illness is a positive emotion, and we want the patients to feel better in order to prevent further deterioration," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She added that in future, research would be conducted to see if the therapy could improve patients' physical capabilities as well.

    Chris Sun takes aim at social worker statutory body

<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour and Welfare Secretary Chris Sun on Friday slammed the Social Worker Registration Board for failing to take concrete steps to ban national security convicts from becoming social workers.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Writing on social media, the minister said the statutory body had failed to alter its procedures, almost two years after a law change intended to keep national security offenders out of the profession.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun also said the board had renewed the licences or approved licence applications from people who had committed serious offences in the past.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said on another occasion, the board approved a social worker facing a rioting charge to become a member of its disciplinary committee panel.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The current actions and decisions have seriously deviated from the spirit of the laws safeguarding national security and disregarded the overall interest of society and damaged the professionalism and credibility of social workers," Sun said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added it's necessary to improve the governance of the statutory body for the profession to get back on the right track, so as to implement the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The chairman of the board, Ng Yut-ming, says he thinks there's a misunderstanding about the board's operations.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Under the present ordinance, we have a mechanism to handle all complaints or different kinds of offences against the law," he told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I don't think the Social Workers Registration Board needs to establish another mechanism to handle the inclusion of national security offences."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Ng said he's met with Sun over the matter on Friday evening, and he said the minister has agreed to meet with the board later on.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The government on Friday said it deplored and opposed what it called "biased remarks" as well as "slanders and smears" about SAR's work in safeguarding national security made by Gregory May, Consul General of the United States of America to Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 May talked about the National Security Law (NSL) at a forum recently held by a US think tank.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A government spokesman said, "the US side has ignored the large-scale and incessant riots during the 'colour revolution' in Hong Kong that occurred in 2019 which devastated our society, livelihood and economy. It ignored the fact that it is an international practice and an inherent right and responsibility for sovereign state to enact laws safeguarding national security."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesman added, "the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR including the NSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance are precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity; and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the principle of 'One country, Two systems' under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesman reiterated, "the HKSAR Government strongly demands the US to immediately stop acting against international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in the affairs of the HKSAR."

    Cooling products to fight heat stress during work
   </title>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Experts on Friday urged employers to offer outdoor workers cooling products as summer approaches, saying they lower the risk of heat stress and heat stroke.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A study by the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) and Polytechnic University found that cooling vests were the most effective after testing the products on 30 workers aged 19 to 35, adding that portable fans and cooling collars were good alternatives.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Alex Cheung, a research assistant professor at the university, said workers won't tire as quickly if they use the products.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We have observed that say, for example, if a participant without wearing any cooling device, then it takes around 15 minutes to complete the task," he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "If that particular subject, after putting on the cooling vest for example, it would allow the participant to say walk for 20 minutes. In that situation, there would be around 30 something percentage increment in terms of working efficiency."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He added that cooling devices could reduce the physiological burden on workers like reducing pulse rate and respiratory rate, and alleviate and delay work fatigue in hot environments.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Meanwhile, Bonnie Yau, executive director of the OSHC, said employers should also conduct heat stroke risk assessments for workers, after noting record-breaking monthly high temperatures this year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "[They should] take preventive measures based on the assessment, such as providing shade, ventilation, drinking water, rest periods and reducing the work intensity," she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "It actually depends on the work environment, but say for construction workers where they are working strenuously and they have to work under the sunlight. Perhaps the cooling vest would be a very good product for them to consider."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Lukfook Jewellery on Friday said it had hired information technology specialists to investigate a potential data breach, after its database was reportedly hacked with the information of the group's members being put up for sale online.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Local media reported that a hacker had obtained the database, which allegedly contained the information of millions of the chain's members, and was prepared to sell the information for 25,000 Tether tokens, or roughly HK$195,000.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Responding to media queries, the jewellery chain stressed it attached great importance to the privacy of its customers, but it could not confirm at the moment if such information had been leaked.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lukfook said it has launched a probe into the incident and filed reports to the police and the privacy commissioner's office.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The privacy watchdog, for its part, said it had not received any reports regarding the incident and would reach out to relevant organisations.

    Work to build Hung Shui Kiu MTR Station begins
   </title>
   <link>

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 The MTR Corporation on Friday said preparatory work had begun for the construction of Hung Shui Kiu Station on the Tuen Ma Line.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The railway firm said construction of the new station, located between Siu Hong and Tin Shui Wai, was expected to be completed in 2030.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Walter Lam, MTR’s project manager overseeing the project, said this is the first time they are adding a station to an operating viaduct, on which the Tuen Ma Line runs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “It’s about 10 to 11 metres above ground. We have a massive high-level working platform. And we don’t want to touch anything on top -- what I mean is the existing utilities, the existing overhead lines. We have to turn off the power,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lam noted that one of the biggest challenges is they only have around six non-traffic hours a week to work at the site.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said they had recently started removing a 400-metre segment of the parapet to make room for the new station.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “Before we cut [the parapet], we have temporary support holding it in place, making sure it won’t move, it’s stable, and it’s safe. It won’t affect the operation on the next day,” he said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The engineer said they would, at the next stage, build a foundation for the new station that is made of pre-cast components.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He said Hung Shui Kiu Station should open in 2030, when residents in the new development area are expected to move in.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The MTR said work was also starting this year to build new stations like Oyster Bay on the Tung Chung Line and Kwu Tung on the East Rail Line.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Over 8,000 students of a private vocational college have been affected by a cyber attack, the privacy watchdog said on Friday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Hong Kong College of Technology said its information technology network and file server were hacked in February.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A ransomware group is believed to have got hold of 450GB of the college's data and the information was made public on the dark web on Tuesday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This is not an ordinary attack, but a highly targeted and unusual cyber attack. The Hong Kong College of Technology condemns any cyber crimes and deeply apologises for any inconvenience and troubles caused by the incident," a spokesperson said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The college said it reported the breach to the police and the privacy commissioner's office, shut down the affected system, and launched a probe with the help of independent cyber security experts.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It added that it will provide credit monitoring and dark web monitoring services to those affected for half a year at no cost.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In response to media enquiries, the privacy commissioner's office said it was informed about the data breach on February 21.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The watchdog said about 8,100 students had been affected and information involved included names, identity card numbers, emails, telephone numbers and addresses.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Education Bureau urged the college to comprehensively investigate the incident and to take appropriate measures to strengthen network security to prevent further similar attacks.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Police said they are investigating the matter but no arrests have been made so far.

    Officials laud success of Southern District care teams

    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior government officials have lauded Southern District care teams for their dedication in serving the community, saying they urgently address the needs of citizens.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chief Secretary Eric Chan and Home and Youth Affairs Secretary Alice Mak attended a ceremony in Aberdeen on Friday to celebrate the teams' first year of operation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan singled out the response to a landslide in Shek O Road last September for particular praise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He noted that care teams were promptly deployed to various locations to provide food and other items to those affected by the landslide by boat, and helped with temporary accommodation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mak, meanwhile, said the care teams have exceeded their performance targets, paying visits to 11,000 households and handling over 1,500 enquiries throughout the past year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The tasks they handled ranged from home repairs, to technology assistance and form-filling support, she said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mak said the teams also organised more than 300 activities, including national education seminars, festive celebrations and policy promotion events in the community.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 She said care teams across Hong Kong visited 90,000 households last year, adding that a review of the scheme will be carried out next year.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 “The first phase of the care team services last for two years and after two years we will definitely review the whole scheme and see how we can enhance and improve the scheme so that more residents can benefit and we can provide more district-based services to our residents,” she said.

    950,000 targeted in new poverty alleviation framework

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The government says the current poverty line may lead to an 'overestimation' of the poverty situation in Hong Kong. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1752596_1_20240510123658.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The government has identified around 950,000 elderly people, single-parent households and subdivided flat tenants for targeted poverty alleviation, in a bid to measure the city's poverty more effectively.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Around 555,000 senior citizens, 213,000 single-parent families and 214,000 people living in subdivided flats are included.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In a Legco paper, the Labour and Welfare Bureau said the move was based on the latest statistics of household characteristics, employment and income conditions.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Since 2013, the official measure of poverty has been defined as living in a household with a monthly income below 50 percent of the median.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But the bureau said the current measurement may lead to an "overestimation" of the poverty situation in Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Since the 'poverty line' was formulated based on the concept of 'relative poverty', poor households will always exist under 'relative poverty' regardless of the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation work," the paper said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "This may create the wrong impression to the public that 'more people become poor despite more resources being put in'. These limitations will in the long run weaken the function of the 'poverty line' in monitoring the actual poverty situation."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The bureau added that officials will offer help to the three target groups through various poverty alleviation projects, and set key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the new poverty framework.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lawmakers are set to discuss the paper during a welfare services panel meeting next Monday.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan Siu-ming, an assistant professor from City University's department of social and behavioural sciences, said officials should include more people in the exercise.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Besides those three target groups, there are also other social groups that may be under poverty or they face different social needs. For example, households [who] have children with special educational needs, or [people who are] disabled or with other serious illnesses. So I think targeting those three groups is good but not enough," he told RTHK.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Chan added that the government should improve the current measurement to give a better picture of the city's poverty situation.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The government can release the statistics about post-intervention. And if the government claim that income is not a very accurate measure, they can supplement it by other surveys, just like counting expenses or housing types. [So] that we can more accurately [calculate] the poverty population."

    Pre-registration for dental clinics not ideal: govt
   </title>

   <description>
    <![CDATA[<div class="itemFullText">
 Health officials have conceded that the pre-registration system for public dental clinics is not an ideal arrangement, saying a planned digital ticketing system will be a better alternative than late-night queues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On Friday, the government pledged to finish the development of an electronic system within this year and provide assistance to people who are not tech-savvy to secure a slot to see a dentist.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The government earlier announced that from July, people will be allowed to sign up for next-day emergency treatment from 8pm, rather than from midnight.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But some lawmakers on the public accounts committee complained that bringing forward the preliminary registration hours will not shorten queuing times.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Unfortunately, I want to emphasise again that if we cannot meet the demand for service, then there will be a need to have a disc allocation. And if you have to ask people to come and queue, then definitely they will all try to come as soon as possible, and there will be a waiting time for them," Health Secretary Lo Chung-mau told the legislators.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "We now try to put in place a better arrangement, so the preliminary registration will be changed to 8pm the night before. I want to emphasise that this is not the ideal arrangement. But we just want to reduce the waiting time for the elderly. So the solution will be electronic registration."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lo added that it would be a "utopian thought" to have no queues at clinics, saying it would require a large number of medical staff providing services.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 It would also be a waste of the city's medical resources, he added.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Director of Health Ronald Lam, for his part, promised that an electronic system would be ready within this year, as authorities are hammering out details with the contractors.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 He also told lawmakers that officials will assist those who are not tech-savvy in making registrations on the platform.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "During the vaccination drive for Covid, there were a number of service points set up to help elderly people who are not familiar with technology to make a booking. There are still a lot of service points running in the community," Lam said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Once we have completed developing the platform, we will offer assistance to elderly people should they need it via these existing service points."

<div class="itemFullText">
 A clinical psychologist warned on Friday that he's noted a link between students' mental health and their relationships with parents.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Amos Cheung, a newly-appointed member of the Advisory Committee on Mental Health, said the focus should be on how to improve parents' mental well-being and communication skills, so they can be good role models.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Recent Education Bureau figures show that the number of primary and secondary school students diagnosed with mental illness has more than tripled in the past five years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheung said he'd noted from his own private practice that students' poor mental health was often related to conflict with family members, and many young people felt that "their conditions were not well understood by their parents ... and] parents have their own agendas to drive".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But he stressed that a variety of pressures were involved, including better identification of possible mental health issues.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "I believe that actually it's a multiple-factors problem. Well, first, [it] might be an indication that actually parents, teachers are now more sensitive to the mental health conditions of young people, so with improved and increased sensitivity, of course, there will be an increase of these diagnoses," Cheung said.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "But, of course, at the same time, it might also mean that, well, the mental health conditions in general might be worsening among these students as well."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Cheung said students learned from adults around them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Children and even adolescents, they are not fully developed and equipped in handling their emotions. Actually they learn from adults. So when the adults around them, if their mental health, if their mental well-being, if their emotional stability are actually already compromised or not established, then of course it will increase their chances of having some of the mental health issues, especially emotionally related," he said.
 <br/>
 He said the focus should be on how to improve the mental well-being and the communication skills of parents.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Because parents are the major key players in all of these things. So that when parents are already good emotion facilitators and communicators, then of course, the mental well-being and the student's ability to actually handle their emotions, would, of course, improve," he said.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong has expressed strong dissatisfaction against remarks made by the US State Department regarding the banning of a protest song in the SAR, calling it a blatant interference in the city’s judicial proceedings.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 A spokesman with the office said in a statement that SAR officials had made the right and necessary move to ban people from using the song to incite others to separate Hong Kong from the rest of the country, or insult the national anthem.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The statement noted that the SAR government and the High Court had fulfilled their constitutional responsibility to protect national security as well as the dignity of ‘March of the Volunteers’.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The spokesman advised certain politicians to respect the basic principles of international relations and stop interfering in Hong Kong as well as China’s internal affairs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The US State Department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, had earlier described the Court of Appeal’s temporary injunction order to ban ‘Glory to Hong Kong’ as “the latest blow” to the SAR’s international reputation.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), Xia Baolong, said the central government will continue to support the SAR's development into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Sun Dong, met Xia in Beijing on Thursday, to brief him on Hong Kong’s efforts in attracting strategic I&T enterprises and talent, as well as the city’s latest developments in areas like digital economy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Xia said the SAR government's work deserves full recognition, and that Beijing will continue to support Hong Kong.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Sun, for his part, said the SAR administration will "live up to its mission" and continue strengthening I&T co-operation with different mainland cities.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Separately, Xia also met with Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung, and expressed the need for Hong Kong to continue developing the tourism sector.

 The HKMAO chief added that the SAR should adopt the strategy of "tourism everywhere", and develop new routes and products to consolidate Hong Kong's reputation as the best travel destination.
