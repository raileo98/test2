    Vulnerable newborns to get dedicated care at hospital

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Queen Mary Hospital has set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals to look after babies born prematurely, while providing psychological and even palliative support for parents in case of emergencies.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The 43-strong team comprises obstetric and paediatric healthcare professionals, clinical psychologists, and social workers. It has helped the parents of over 20 babies since 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The team springs into action whenever a baby is delivered between 23 and 25 weeks, the so-called periviability interval where medical intervention is often needed in order for the newborn to survive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Up to a quarter of the infants also develop severe disabilities later on.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leading the team is Mimi Seto, an associate consultant at the hospital's Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said apart from caring for premature babies, the team also intervenes by delaying pre-term labour for expecting mothers by prescribing them medication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "[We use] antenatal steroid drugs to enhance the fetal lung maturity, and give them magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If needed, if [the mothers] are in pre-term labour, having regular contractions, we might also give the mother tocolytic therapy, which is a drug to stop the uterus from contracting."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The logic, Seto said, is to allow the baby to receive sufficient prenatal treatment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But she admitted tocolytic therapy may have side effects to the mother, even though it is safe most of the time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In some cases, the hospital also provides palliative care to parents, including counselling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Seto suggested all mothers-to-be, especially those with a history of pre-term birth, to seek antenatal care as soon as their pregnancy begins and follow the advice by obstetricians.

 Members of the national team arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday to celebrate their success at this year's Olympics, with a delegation including 59 competitors who were either individual champions or part of winning teams.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The group of 65 competitors were in the SAR for a three-day visit, with events including an evening reception and banquet hosted by the Hong Kong government, followed by a gala show and sporting demonstrations in the coming days.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Addressing the athletes at a banquet, Chief Executive John Lee said their visit will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to pursue careers in the sports industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Looking back, the mainland's Olympic athletes delegation has visited Hong Kong several times. Their visits not only enhance emotional exchanges of the people between the two places, but also facilitate the exchange and development of sports culture," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe that this visit will further deepen the profound friendship between Hong Kong and the mainland. It will inspire more young people in Hong Kong to engage in sports careers and strive for excellence."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among the delegation visiting the SAR was all-time great in table tennis, Ma Long, sporting a gold from the team event – the sixth he has won in his illustrious career.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a meet-the-media event, Ma said it was the fourth time he had joined a visit to Hong Kong, adding that he is always touched by the warm greetings he receives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This time around, I hope to have more opportunities to communicate with the young people in Hong Kong. I think this would definitely be a special memory in my career," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "After the Olympics, many people have been asking me about my future plans. As of now, I am still an athlete. Of course, if there are any changes, I will definitely let everyone know."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Diving superstar Quan Hongchan had captured the hearts of many fans with her cute personality as she struck gold again in the women's individual 10 metres platform and the synchronised 10 metres platform with teammate Chen Yuxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I think if you have passion, go for it. Don’t be afraid of failure. I would also like to thank everyone for liking me so much," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, swimmer Pan Zhanle, who made headlines for his world record-setting victory in the 100 metres freestyle, said he was looking forward to meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I will first train myself well. When I become more mature, I can then be a role model for others," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team won a total of 91 medals at the Paris Games, including 40 golds, 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Former Stand News editors convicted of sedition

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Two former editors of a now-shuttered online news outlet and its parent company have been found guilty of conspiring to publish seditious articles. File photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=80&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768189_1_20240829180525.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Two former editors of the now-defunct online news outlet Stand News were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to publish seditious articles.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen and acting chief editor Patrick Lam were convicted of conspiring to publish and reproduce seditious publications between July 2020 and December 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News' parent company, Best Pencil Limited, was also found guilty of the same offence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written judgement, District Court judge Kwok Wai-kin ruled that 11 of the 17 publications raised by the prosecution were seditious, noting the political climate at the time was extremely heated and many people were unhappy with the SAR and central governments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The published materials included interviews with opposition figures as well as commentaries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that the political ideology of Stand News was localism and its stance was to "support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “During the anti-extradition bill movement, it even became a tool to smear and vilify the central authorities and the SAR government,” Kwok wrote in the judgement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The court ruled that Chung knew and approved of the articles’ seditious intentions and offered Stand News as a platform to incite hatred against central and SAR authorities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The judge also noted that Lam approved one of the articles found to be seditious, while at the same time voicing support for the anti-extradition bill movement in a forum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The verdict, originally slated for last October, was postponed three times pending an appeal in a separate sedition case.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sentencing has been adjourned to September 26, and both Chung and Lam were freed on bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They each face up to two years in prison.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam was absent from the hearing on Thursday due to a health issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Defence lawyer Audrey Eu read aloud Lam’s mitigation letter in court, which said Stand News journalists sought to run a news outlet with fully independent editorial standards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Journalists are not only responsible for their own reports. They are also failing in their duty if they deliberately avoid reporting when they know the public has the right to be informed,” Eu quoted Lam as saying.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also revealed that Lam is suffering from a “rare disease” that required chemotherapy, and it would be difficult for him to receive medical care if jailed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a written mitigation letter submitted to the court, Chung said it is the “inescapable responsibility” of journalists to report the truth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Senior counsel Eu told the court that both defendants had spent over 10 months behind bars before getting bail.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Stand News closed down in December 2021 after police raided its office and froze its assets.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters outside the court after the verdict, chief superintendent from the national security unit, Steve Li, said police welcomed the court's decision.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When the national security department took the enforcement against the Stand News on December 2021, some people criticised us that we are suppressing the freedom of the speech and the press," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But the judge's verdict has clearly illustrated the necessity and the lawfulness of the enforcement [action] taken on that day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters at another event, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said authorities respected and valued media freedom, which is protected by law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If all journalists report based on facts, I think there would not be situations restricting the freedom of the press," he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Criticising the government is not an action that is not allowed. We see news articles criticising the government every day."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a statement issued late Thursday evening, a government spokesman said any person or organisation which incites hatred or conduct activities that endanger national security will definately be penalised in accordance with the law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesperson also slammed Stand News for reporting on activities or comments that incite hatred, and calling those “journalistic work”.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “That is the biggest disgrace to Hong Kong’s professional journalism sector,” he added.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A High Court jury on Thursday convicted one person and cleared six others over a plot to bomb and shoot police officers in 2019, after Hong Kong's first-ever trial involving United Nations anti-terrorism legislation.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lai Chun-pong, who was 29 when he was arrested, was found guilty of conspiracy to "likely endanger life or to cause serious injury to property.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He is expected to appear in court next Monday to offer a mitigation plea.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Six co-defendants, Cheung Chun-fu, Cheung Ming-yu, Yim Man-him, Christian Lee, Justin Hui and Lau Pui-ying were cleared of related charges, including conspiring to set off bombs and conspiracy to murder.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One of them, Cheung Chun-fu, had earlier pleaded guilty to charges of possessing explosives and firearms and was given an 18-month prison sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The prosecution had told the court that the bomb plot involved planting explosives in Wan Chai during a rally to mark International Human Rights Day in December 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters, chief superintendent Steve Li from the national security police said he would not comment on the court's decision, but stressed the case was very serious in nature.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This is a very serious case, involving genuine firearms, explosives, and a very organised plot to kill police and other innocent people as well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But as a police, I can assure that we have tried our best to protect our society."

    Labour rights group says heat protections not enough

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Survey shows workers felt unwell while working under hot weather and 40 percent of employers provided insufficient heat relief measures. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768168_1_20240829165538.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Labour rights group, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, on Thursday said around 40 percent of employers had insufficient measures to prevent heat stroke among workers during hot weather.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The association surveyed around 400 workers, mainly construction workers and cleaners, between June and August 2024.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The survey showed that nearly 50 percent of respondents had felt unwell while working under hot weather, with symptoms including dizziness and headaches.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also found that workers lacked sufficient rest time during hot conditions, with 40 percent of respondents saying they did not have the basic 10 to 15 minutes of rest every two hours, while nearly half did not receive extra rest during a Heat Stress at Work Warning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu Sin-man, head of the association, said employers misunderstood the guidelines from the Labour Department, leading to workers' rest times being reduced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because we only focus on when the heat warning is in effect, the employer needs to provide equipment or measures for cooling. But if they do that, they can reduce the rest time. This is the misleading information for us, because our calculation is we must have a basic rest time, 10 to 15 minutes, plus the extra resting time when the heat warning is in effect. I think most employers or employees do not know this information."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She suggested the government emphasise workers' basic rest time and eliminate the "rest time reducing" approach.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Siu believed that due to a lack of legal weight behind the current guidelines, employers may not be willing to cooperate proactively with the recommendations. She hopes legislation could be enacted in future to hold employers accountable.

    Development sectors will need more workers: study

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management says the architecture, engineering, and construction sectors will create more jobs in future years. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1768155_1_20240829155218.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A human resource body on Thursday said its research indicated the development and real estate sectors would need more workers in the next three years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management based the finding on a study of 300 companies in 20 sectors between April and June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The study showed that the overall workforce in Hong Kong would grow by two percent by 2028.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute said demand for manpower in fields such as architecture, engineering, and construction was expected to grow by up to nine percent, due to major development projects such as the Northern Metropolis and Kau Yi Chau Artificial Island.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, technological advances would lead to fewer jobs in the retail, transportation and media sectors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The institute's president Lawrence Hung, called on the government to adjust its talent recruitment efforts accordingly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government should actively listen to industry feedback, provide more proactive measures for businesses to fill vacancies, and adjust talent admission schemes based on actual circumstances to effectively attract overseas talent to supplement the local talent pool," he said in a statement.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong on Thursday rolled out the red carpet for a delegation of athletes who competed for the national team at the Olympics.
 <br>
  <br/>
  SAR officials and primary school students welcomed the 90-member delegation at the airport, which included 65 elite athletes, eight coaches and some administrators.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Secretary Eric Chan thanked the Olympians for making a three-day visit to the territory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I believe many Hong Kong residents are as happy as I am. I thank the coaches and athletes for coming to Hong Kong just shortly after the closing of the Olympic Games, allowing us to get a close-up glimpse of the national team athletes," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan, who led the delegation said he felt welcome as soon as he arrived, adding the mainland and Hong Kong should work together to carry forward the spirit of sport.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We will have exchanges with the SAR government, departments and residents, especially young people. We will learn from each other, build friendships and contribute to the development of the motherland and Hong Kong," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One eight-year-old fan was at the airport to greet the athletes and he said he couldn't sleep the night before.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because I was too excited! I'd been waiting for this day to come and I couldn't sleep at night! I want to meet Quan Hongchan the most because I like diving. But I'm too short so I couldn't see her," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another fan said she wanted to meet the table tennis players the most, but she failed to grab a ticket for the gala show and demonstrations.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I tried to buy a ticket, but I failed. Everyone loves them...I was so excited when I saw Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha because I supported them throughout the whole Paris Olympics," she said.
  <br/>

 A senior field assistant died on Wednesday after losing consciousness on the job at Tai Mo Shan Country Park.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lam Kin-wai, 46, who worked in the Conservation Branch of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, injured his right palm when collecting plant specimens with his colleagues in the morning before losing consciousness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  His colleagues called the police for help, but he was pronounced dead at hospital.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities said the cause of death would be investigated.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Mickey Lai, director of the AFCD, said the department would provide support and assistance to Lam's family.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Having joined the AFCD for over 13 years, Mr Lam served the community with dedication and perseverance. His performance was excellent and he was held in high regard by colleagues," he said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I am deeply grieved at the loss of such a devoted colleague. On behalf of all our colleagues, I offer the deepest condolences to his family."
  <br/>

    Ng Tung River may be home to endangered Eurasian otter

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Conservation experts are urging people to keep an eye out next time they're walking by a river, as they may catch a rare glimpse of an endangered Eurasian otter.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Researchers from the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden on Wednesday said they have found traces of the mammals' faeces by the Ng Tung River near Sheung Shui.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said that previously, signs of the creature had only been found in remote areas, and this discovery proves that they can live close to urban districts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yang Jianhuan, Conservation Manager of Kadoorie Conservation China, said this is the first time the farm has found signs of the animals in rivers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The new finding in the Ng Tung River is also very important because previously the otters recorded in Hong Kong were mainly in mangrove forests and the fish pond areas, and this is the record that proves the otter can inhabit the water channels close to urban areas," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the expert warned that planned developments for the Northern Metropolis could threaten the otters' habitats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are not mountain species, they don't live in the country parks. They live in low land and much of their habitats are unprotected and under severe human disturbance... and all these lowland wetlands are right within the Northern Metropolis area," Yang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that if people do manage to spot one of the otters, they should leave it alone and contact the organisation.

    Home prices fall again, rents hit near 5-year highs

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Home prices have dropped for the third consecutive month after a brief rebound earlier in the year. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767962_1_20240828124857.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Official figures showed home prices in Hong Kong continued to fall last month, whereas rents reached their highest in nearly five years.
 <br>
  <br/>
  According to data from the Rating and Valuation Department, private flats were 1.9 percent cheaper in July than the month before, marking the third consecutive month of decline.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Home prices briefly rose after the government scrapped all market-cooling measures in February, before the downward trend resumed in May.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the first seven months of 2024, prices were down by 4.7 percent year on year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Analysts have said sales may pick up after interest rates start to fall, with the US Federal Reserve indicating that it will begin reducing borrowing costs in September.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, strong demand pushed rents up by 1.1 percent last month from June.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That raised private sector rents to their highest levels since October 2019.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Court of Appeal on Wednesday ordered a retrial in the case of a man cleared of involvement in a mob attack in and around Yuen Long MTR Station in July 2019.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The Department of Justice had earlier appealed against the District Court's decision to acquit Wong Chi-wing on charges of rioting and wounding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The higher court accepted that appeal and remitted the case to the District Court for retrial.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong was released on bail ahead of an expected court appearance on October 15.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Four others – Tang Wai-sum, Ng Wai-nam, Tang Ying-bun and Choi Lap-ki – were earlier jailed for between three and seven years on the same charges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Choi's conviction was later quashed on appeal, while the other three lost challenges against their convictions.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Ocean Park said panda lovers may have to wait until February next year before they catch a glimpse of the new twin babies born earlier this month.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In an interview with the Hong Kong Economic Times, Ocean Park chairman Paulo Pong made reference to the panda twins born in Macau in 2016, noting that cubs would normally be at least six months old before going on display and meeting the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for two adult giant pandas that are set to arrive in the SAR next month as gifts by the mainland authorities, Pong said they are expected to the meet the public in December at the earliest.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said the number of people visiting the giant pandas would be restricted in the initial stage, which would allow them to better adapt to the new environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pong added that Ocean Park would look for names for the cubs and the new giant pandas in the next few months, and hopes the public can provide suggestions.

    Priority for new parents in choosing subsidised homes

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The authority's subsidised housing committee chairperson, Cleresa Wong, says she is not worried about the demand for this latest batch of HOS flats. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767870_1_20240827175919.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Applications for more than 7,100 government-subsidised homes will open in the fourth quarter of this year, with households that have newborns being given priority when selecting homes for the first time.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The new units in the latest round of the Home Ownership Scheme are from five estates – in Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, Yau Tong, Tung Chung and Tuen Mun – and priced from HK$1.43 million to HK$4.67 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Successful applicants are expected to be able to select subsidised homes from the second quarter of 2025, which are marked with a 30 percent discount, smaller than the previous batch's offering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cleresa Wong, who chairs the Housing Authority's subsidised housing committee, said the monthly median income of target buyers has risen, meaning they are more capable of affording such homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She also brushed aside concerns that a downturn in the property market would affect the sale of these homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not compare these prices with that in the private market because our target buyers are different. The buyers we want to help are those whom we have determined are unable to purchase a private market flat," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I'm not worried about how popular these homes will be. There are a lot of people who we have to help."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority has also set aside 40 percent of the flats, or 2,900 of them, for ballots from households with elderly members or newborns, who will have priority when choosing their desired homes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a bid to boost the city's birth rate, families with children aged three years or younger at the time of application and those who are born on or after October 25 last year will have a better chance of buying subsidised flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong said successful applicants with priority are no longer picking from the entire pool of available flats, and instead each housing project will have a set proportion of units for them to choose.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ”This time, we hope that applicants will have a more reasonable chance of selecting the unit they want," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We have noticed that in the past, people with priority tended to prefer homes with better locations and those that are larger."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another 10 percent of homes are earmarked for single-person household applicants, Wong added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, families of two or more who are "white form" applicants will be subject to a monthly income ceiling of HK$60,000, from the previous HK$62,000, and an asset limit of HK$1.23 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The amount will be halved for single-person households.

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month. Photo: Xinhua" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=95&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767869_1_20240827175909.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong’s export figures have improved for the fifth consecutive month, rising 13.1 percent to HK$390.4 billion in July, when compared to the same month last year.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Official figures released on Tuesday showed imports rose 9.9 percent year-on-year to HK$412.3 billion, which left the city with a trade deficit of HK$21.8 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Exports to the mainland, the United States and the European Union continued to rise, while sales to other major Asian markets had a mixed performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Combining the figures for the first seven months of the year, exports jumped 12.4 percent year-on-year, while imports rose 8 percent.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A government spokesperson said Hong Kong's exports should remain positive as long as external demand holds up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the spokesperson added that there are still risks associated with geopolitical tensions and trade conflicts.

    Don't overlook palliative care for children: medics

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Chan Cheong-wai (bottom second right) says parents often prioritise seeking curative treatments, overlooking palliative care for their children. Photo: RTHK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=85&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767858_1_20240827172850.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Paediatricians and scholars on Tuesday said parents should not overlook palliative care when their children are confronting complex diseases or symptoms.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Palliative care, which includes end-of-life care, is a specialised type of care aimed at alleviating pain and other symptoms associated with severe illnesses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The call came after researchers at Polytechnic University interviewed 65 people, including children aged between eight and 19 years old, their parents, and medics between 2019 and 2021.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a press briefing, Professor Frances Wong from the university's nursing school said parents need to understand how to live with the life-long diseases their children are facing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The point of treatment and diagnosis is not the end, it's just the beginning. How the parents actually face living with the disease and, therefore, a palliative care model
  <br/>
  actually has the benefits to provide that continuity of care," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wong added that parents can start palliative care for their children even before the diagnosis is complete.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Chan Cheong-wai, who chairs the Hong Kong Society of Children's Palliative Care, said diagnosing intricate illnesses often takes years, but parents often focus on seeking curative treatments, overseeing palliative care for their children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If a child had cancer, the first thing that the parents may think about will be any kind of curative treatment,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So at that juncture, most of the doctors and nurses will focus on the curative treatment instead of other elements like psychological support. We are not saying that psychological support is not important, but at that time, the parents' main focus is still on the medical side."

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) on Tuesday urged the government to provide more support for parents, to boost the city's fertility rate.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The society said it conducted a survey from May to June involving 1,200 women who had one child.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About 30 percent said they would have another child, while the rest were either undecided or said they would not have any more children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The reasons for ruling out a second child included the financial burden, heavy parenting responsibilities and the difficulty in balancing work and childcare.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  HKSPC director Subrina Chow said the government will make available 900 additional places in day childcare services over the next few years, but the number is still inadequate.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "For the long-term development of Hong Kong, in terms of helping more women or adults to be able to join the workforce and helping to increase birth rates so as to address the issues of an ageing population, we feel the government could make further investment in this area because that's going to benefit the society as a whole," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow added that not many people in the childcare sector are experienced in looking after very young children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current programmes provided by our universities and training institutions are all focused on the three to six age range, so we do need a lot more programme content to be devoted to the younger children," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive introduced a HK$20,000 handout for parents of newborn babies in last year's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Chow said parents want "long-term" support instead, so the authorities should consider offering more parental leave as well as child healthcare vouchers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Official data shows the number of births in the SAR dropped from 91,000 in 2012 to 32,000 in 2022.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Officials on Tuesday said a transformed museum documenting the War of Resistance will open to the public next week to showcase relics from the war and the country's history.
 <br>
  <br/>
  On September 3, the existing Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence will be renamed the Hong Kong Museum of the War of Resistance and Coastal Defence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cultural and tourism minister Kevin Yeung said officials would work with their Shenzhen counterparts to organise thematic exhibitions on the war.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The words 'War of Resistance' demonstrate the museum's theme of commemorating the history of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and inheriting the patriotic spirit," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It also aligns with the high respect for the heroes and martyrs of the War of Resistance and warns future generations to cherish peace."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression was one of the theatres of World War 2 in Asia.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheung Yui-sum, director of the Museum of History, told reporters there will be new features and performances.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We aim to organise more exhibitions and public programmes [for] the general public to let them know more about the War of Resistance history and the significance of this period of time, so that they can establish their self-esteem of being a Chinese and to let them know more about their motherland," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The chief executive said in his 2023 Policy Address that the new museum would focus on the war of resistance to cultivate a stronger sense of national esteem and patriotism.

    HKU to trial use of sound waves to treat cancer
   </title>

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The University of Hong Kong's faculty of medicine says it is planning the first clinical trials in Asia of a device designed to treat cancer with sound waves.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Twenty liver cancer patients will be given histotripsy treatment at Queen Mary Hospital from September, the faculty said on Tuesday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The histotripsy is basically a very high-focus ultrasound that basically induces a sudden expansion and collapse of the cancer cells… and that creates a shock wave and that basically would break down the cancer cells and we call it liquefying the cancer cells. That would completely kill the cancer cells,” said professor Albert Chan from the university.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “And what is so different from the usual treatment is actually the minimally invasiveness. So without any scars, any wounds, we can now treat the patients... This is a non-radiation treatment, so we can actually apply it to a broad spectrum of patients.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan noted that liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Hong Kong, with about 1,700 to 1,800 new cases per year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Mike Blue – a representative of the manufacturer of the machine involved – said the technology could be used to treat most cancers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This particular system has been designed in the future to treat everywhere really from the neck down. So we envision years from now, histotripsy and this particular system will be used to treat thyroid, breast, sarcomas, liver, kidney, pancreas, really anywhere in the body,” the HistoSonics CEO said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Blue added that the treatment is also effective on recurrent cancer patients, adding that it has already been used in the US on those with early and advanced stages of the disease.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that after the clinical trial on liver cancer at HKU is completed in about two years, the team plans to carry out clinical studies in the SAR for other types of cancer, including kidney and pancreatic cancer.

    'Uni town to cover 30 hectares of Yuen Long village'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Almost half of a planned academic town near the border will be built on land in a rural village in Yuen Long, according to Development Secretary Bernadette Linn.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The "Northern Metropolis University Town" will be for local educational institutions to strengthen cooperation with their mainland and overseas counterparts.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The town, as part of the massive Northern Metropolis project, will cover more than 60 hectares at Hung Shui Kiu, Ha Tsuen, Ngau Tam Mei and a new town in the New Territories.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said some 20 hectares of the academic district would be around Ping Che and Ta Kwu Ling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authorities will also reserve about 30 hectares of land in Ngau Tam Mei for the district, Linn said, adding that a full development plan for the village could be unveiled after October's policy address.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Ngau Tam Mei is very close to the San Tin Technopole. They are only one station apart. For the future Northern Link, there will be a station at San Tin and the next southbound station will be Ngau Tam Mei," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We think that the education district in Ngau Tam Mei should be somewhat related to the San Tin Technopole, innovation and technology, and scientific research."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also said the government will press ahead with the massive development in the New Territories, after the High Court granted an application for a judicial review of the government's decision to approve the environmental study of the San Tin Technopole project.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On the future of the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands project, the development chief reiterated that the government is pushing back the reclamation process off Lantau, but isn't scrapping the plan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are indeed behind the original schedule, but we are not shelving the project. I am concerned that the word 'suspend' may sometimes make people feel that we are putting it down," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We may also prolong the reclamation process, because we certainly have room to think about how many phases the project should be divided into for the 1,000 hectares of reclaimed land."

    US rate cut 'should spark demand for new property'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, said developers would have to be competitive on pricing. Photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767774_1_20240827093321.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The chairman of Professional Property Services Group, Nicholas Brooke, says he thinks an interest rate cut in the US will spark demand for residential property purchases here, although developers will have to be competitive on pricing.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "I think we have to be honest. There's a greater degree of optimism now with the news about likely interest rate cuts by the Fed so that's feeding through into the market. I think if you ask me about market sentiment, I would say the market remains cautious but there is a greater degree of optimism," he said on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And the reality is that after 18 months of treading water, if you like, there's significant latent demand from both first-time buyers and upgraders so the demand is there I'm sure."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Last Friday Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said it was time for the US to start cutting interest rates and with the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar, that should mean lower borrowing costs here.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said there was an estimated surplus of 20,000 to 22,000 unsold new private units, which was equivalent to at least half a year's supply. He said 7,000 to 10,000 could be sold by the end of the year and the remainder could probably be sold by the middle of next year. But he said this would mean developers would have to be competitive on pricing for at least the next 12 months or so to work through this inventory.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke also said he didn't expect private residential rents to fall in the near term, even though he saw pent-up demand to buy new flats.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "I actually see rents going up. We've got the talent scheme and there's quite significant demand from the student community for rental accommodation. We're short of private rental stock in Hong Kong. If anything, I think rents may well rise in the short and medium term because there is demand, and it's real demand," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, Brooke said the situation for commercial rents was very poor with prime office buildings in top locations in some cases being half empty.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Well, the office market is in some disarray from a vacancy and occupancy perspective," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There are two major buildings in Central, which are probably 40-to-50 percent let, struggling to find new tenants."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Brooke said the commercial market was very soft generally and that was a function of the economy at large.

    More opt for green burial for sense of comfort

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Green burial is becoming increasingly popular in Hong Kong as people look for a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to handle the ashes of their loved ones.
 <br>
  <br/>
  An academic said the trend could mean less demand for public columbariums and niches, which would have a positive impact on Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Figures from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department showed that the number of green burials in Hong Kong almost tripled in the past decade, to 9,381 last year from 3,400 in 2013.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Green burial refers to scattering the ashes of your loved ones in gardens of remembrance or at designated waters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leo, a Hongkonger who now lives in Australia, scattered the ashes of his father at sea in accordance with his wishes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "He loved to travel... and I feel that he could enjoy his freedoms in the sea after his death," Leo said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that sea burial brought him closer to his father.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because he's already in the sea, I can look out at the sea and feel like I'm talking to him wherever he goes. I imagine he's with me in Australia. I can say 'Hello, how are you?' to him anytime."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, meanwhile, chose a different final resting place for her mother, whose ashes were scattered at a garden of remembrance at Diamond Hill.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine said that symbolised a sense of comfort and freedom for her mother.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If they scatter the ashes in the garden, it's like return to the nature and close to ground and close to us... that's where they land and where they choose, and they feel comfortable.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In some way, they feel like a bit of free up after their death."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Katherine, who now lives in Australia, said she likes to see more flexibility in funeral arrangements in Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, it's very common in Australia for green burial... There are many choices... A lot of people feel if they scatter their ashes on a garden, and then they grow a tree of some sort, and they feel very romantic and like an extension of life. They choose where they want to finish. And so it's pretty flexible in Australia."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Amy Chow, a professor of social work at the University of Hong Kong, said people have opted for green burial as they become more aware of the environment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of the traditional belief, if you put your essentials in a cemetery, most of the time when you worship, you will burn paper offerings, you will burn incense. And this is also not good for the environment. But if you scatter the ashes in the nature, you just like, you just need to look up to the sky and say your prayers in your heart, and it won't cause anything to the environment," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chow hopes that with more burial options available, there will be less demand for public columbariums and niches and the city can make better use of our land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She believes the trend of green burial will continue to grow.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “If there are more choices, I do think it will diversify the choices and then the number demanding traditional way will be reduced... Actually in the free market, Hong Kong people are still having a lot of choices, like they can turn the ashes into diamond, into artwork, into glassware. And also they may bring it to this space through private service, via, you know, Nasa.”

<div class="itemFullText">
 Commerce minister Algernon Yau has pledged to make Hong Kong a multinational supply chain management centre to attract more mainland firms to set up shop in the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Speaking at a ceremony on Monday, the secretary for commerce and economic development said his bureau was coordinating with relevant authorities to provide one-stop services for companies to come to the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "To facilitate the country's accelerated development of new quality productive forces, the SAR government is committed to building Hong Kong into a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting more mainland manufacturers to set up here, managing their offshore trade headquarters, providing comprehensive and complete professional services, and assisting firms to upgrade their supply chain and expanding overseas business," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said more than 700 firms have opened or expanded their business in Hong Kong since last year, bringing huge investment and employment opportunities.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Political heavyweights attending a seminar promoting the spirit of the third plenum on Monday said the session highlighted Hong Kong's role in national development.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Two senior Beijing officials, Shen Chunyao and Wang Wentao, held a seminar on the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of China's Communist Party, which wrapped up in Beijing last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The plenum adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Starry Lee, Hong Kong's sole delegate to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters after the seminar that the SAR can contribute in a lot of ways.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The two VIPs do suggest a lot of Hong Kong strengths, and the CE does suggest that we have to incorporate into our daily life. I totally agree with them, and we have to [take] action and we have to use Hong Kong's ability to contribute to the future of our country," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Executive councillor and lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said Hong Kong has to work harder to lure global talent and enterprises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In the near future and also in the distant future, we have to attract more companies to come and settle in Hong Kong and also talent to come to Hong Kong to help us progress. Hong Kong can go from strength to strength," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We do not have to worry too much about the fake news that is demonstrated by the liars everywhere around the world. We have to make sure that we do what is right for the country and for Hong Kong."

<div class="itemFullText">
 Senior Beijing officials on Monday highlighted the key roles of Hong Kong and its contribution to the country, while also stressing that China's development offers the strongest support for the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  China's Communist Party earlier wrapped up the third plenary session of its 20th Central Committee, adopting a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At a seminar held in Hong Kong on promoting the spirit of the plenum, Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress, said the country must rely on reform and opening up to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Through reform and opening up, we have to promote the modernisation with Chinese characteristics... Reform and opening up have been crucial to the course of the party and the people, enabling us to catch up with the times in great strides," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Shen, who also chairs the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, pointed to a particular role for Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles, given their respective strengths as 'super-connectors'. Hong Kong and Macau should play their respective roles in telling China's story well," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In the resolution, Beijing stated its support for Hong Kong's bid in becoming an "international hub for high-end talent" and consolidating its status as an international finance, maritime and trading centre.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said as a separate customs territory and a free port, the SAR serves as an important bridge for trade and investment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Wang also said Hong Kong should expand its talent pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Hong Kong has long been nurturing talent from different parts of the world, and has a great business environment and a highly internationalised market. The education system and city life are very attractive. These are Hong Kong's strengths in pooling talent from far and wide,” he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The commerce minister also said the One Country, Two Systems principle is "the biggest advantage" Hong Kong has.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When it comes to support, our country's development is the biggest support that Hong Kong can get," Wang said. "I personally think that national strength and capacity is the biggest support for Hong Kong."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zheng Yanxiong, director of Beijing's liaison office, said the top-level meeting showed the central government's high hopes for the SAR, and that the city should stay determined and find new ways to contribute to the country's reform and opening up.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There is extensive discussion of reform measures about Hong Kong. This shows the solicitude and high expectations of the central government. This is a strategic fulcrum for Hong Kong to shine. This also means new opportunities for Hong Kong to go from stability to prosperity," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Executive John Lee, for his part, said Hong Kong has played a key role in the country's reform and opening up and the SAR must be more proactive in integrating into the development of the nation.

    5 more arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The ICAC and the Competition Commission conducted a joint operation last week, to crack down on what they say was a syndicate engaging in corruption and bid rigging.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Five more people were arrested for alleged corruption and bid rigging in an operation that has seen more than 20 people investigated since April.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The alleged mastermind and core syndicate members of the same syndicate were among 20 arrested in the first joint-operation between the Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Competition Commission.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The two statutory bodies revealed on Monday they carried out a second joint-operation last week.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They said the five were suspected of engaging in acts which corrupted the renovation projects of two Hong Kong Island housing estates.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The key members of the syndicate allegedly offered advantages to members of the Owners' Corporation through middlemen, so as to ensure the two syndicate-controlled companies would be awarded the contracts worth HK$140 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Work on the projects had yet to begin.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Competition Commission also found the arrestees were allegedly involved in tender-rigging for contracts on 38 residential estates and industrial buildings amounting to over HK$1 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The highest amount involved a contract worth HK$260 million.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Felix Au, head of investigations of the Competition Commission, said their investigation found that when renovation contracts were opened for tender, staff of the company concerned were alleged to have directly, or through middlemen, exchanged and coordinated the bidding price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Some of the project contractors, meanwhile, carried out cover bidding, such as through using a higher bidding price to cover for others, until they have controlled the bidding results, and helped the designated bidder to win the tender," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers seized several computers, mobile phones, as well as related documents after searching around 20 premises.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Authorities did not rule out more arrests.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Hong Kong should learn from and embrace the spirit of the third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and integrate it into daily life, Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  More than 500 government officials, Executive Council members and lawmakers on Monday morning attended a seminar held at the government headquarters promoting the spirit of the plenum.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The talks were led by Shen Chunyao, vice-chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the country's top legislature, and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who's also the Secretary of the CPC leadership group of the Ministry of Commerce.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The third plenum, which wrapped up last month in Beijing, adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernisation.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after the seminar, Lee said studying the spirit of the third plenum was beneficial to the SAR's long-term development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to understand its importance and significance for Hong Kong's future development, seize the opportunities, and further leverage Hong Kong's advantages of being highly internationalised, market-oriented, and rule of law-based under the 'One Country, Two Systems' system," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Hong Kong plays an irreplaceable role in the country's further reform and opening up. As a super connector and super value-adder, Hong Kong continues to play an important role as a bridge and window connecting the mainland and the world in going global and bringing in [enterprises]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about measures to attract high-end talent from around the world, Lee said the SAR government had introduced a series of programmes to bring in graduates from top universities.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CE said there were 340,000 applications for the Top Talent Pass Scheme so far, of which 210,000 had been approved.

    'Revenue not the only consideration for land sales'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Development chief Bernadette Linn says financial proceeds are just one of the factors the government considers when it comes to the pace of land sales, saying market sentiment and the effect on prices of putting a plot up for sale are also important.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Amid a sluggish property market, the government has eight plots in its land sale programme in the current financial year. One plot in Sha Tin was put up for sale in the last quarter, and another in the same area in the quarter before that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking in an exclusive interview with RTHK, Linn said if a plot goes unsold or the bids received are far lower than market estimates, it can hurt property prices in the relevant district.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The minister said officials therefore need to assess the sentiments of the market and developers when making decisions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the land sale programme can serve as an adjustment tool and if there is sufficient private land, then the government doesn't need to roll out as much.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The secretary noted that in the past three financial years, not all sites in the programme were made available for bidding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also described the economy as being at a turning point right now.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Many people have expectations about the US cutting interest rates later. Will Hong Kong follow? Everyone can see the market sentiments, like in the past half a year, there has been economic growth," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "But everyone is taking the wait and see approach - whether the growth is sustainable. Investors are taking that approach, and so are developers who bid for land."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn also shot down the idea of returning to the system before 2013, when land sales were triggered by developers' applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said the government needs to have control over land provision and stability, saying the public could get very pessimistic about the market if developers are conservative and don't make applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For the current financial year, the government has yet to put up any commercial plots for sale.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Linn said if office vacancy rates in the upcoming quarters remain similar to current levels, there's a chance the government will continue to defer rolling out plots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She said there are currently plenty of commercial buildings under construction, and so supply is not a problem.

    CUHK unveils novel remote endoscopy surgery

    <![CDATA[<img alt="The research team in Zurich demonstrates how to use a joystick to remotely control an endoscope in Hong Kong.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A surgeon in Zurich has performed the world’s first remote endoscopy procedure on a pig in Hong Kong, as researchers believe it paves the path for better and immediate surgical care in remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The procedure was conducted in May as part of a joint-study between the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) which started two years ago.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The clinician in Switzerland controlled a surgical controller that was remotely connected across 9,300 kilometres to an endoscope in the operating theatre in Hong Kong, CUHK said, noting that the endoscope matched every movement the clinician made.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The design was to use multiple small magnets to build our endoscope and use a magnetic field to control the direction, forward, backward, turn left, turn right, to control the angulation of the endoscope to perform an endoscopy," says Dr Shannon Chan from CUHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “So the surgeon in Switzerland would use the controller to control the magnetic field in Hong Kong and thus, with that, he could control the endoscope.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Dr Chan said the technology could be a game-changer for remote areas where local expertise is lacking.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “For places where they are lacking in experts, for example, in gastrointestinal disease, then the experts in their hometown can control and perform the endoscope for patients… so the experts can diagnose and treat patients from afar,” she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “We are hoping that with this technology... we are able to train doctors in resource-limited areas to perform some procedures remotely instead of having to fly over to their country to teach them.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But Dr Chan noted a key prerequisite would be a stable Wi-Fi network in those areas, saying that would take a few years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  She added that it's too early to compare the success rate of remote surgery with conventional procedure, saying the research team's next step is to prove the procedure is safe on human patients.

  <br/>
  Chan said figures showed that one in five programme participants would successfully secure the position of Probationary Inspector.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This success rate surpasses that of non-participants, where only one out of every 27 people succeeded.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan explained that those who join the mentorship programme would gain hands-on experience and personal coaching from police officers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The very intentions of the rolling out of the programme is to allow mentees to have a diverse experience in getting to know what the police does, and how it's like to be a police officer should they join in the future," he told RTHK.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So, for this programme, every mentee is assigned with a mentor who will give them personal experience and coaching and workshop for their preparations."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This year, 228 people joined the police mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among them was 24-year-old Luce Lo, who took a two-month hiatus from her full-time job as a financial adviser for the mentorship.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lo said she was motivated to join the Police Force after the mentorship programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "My determination is far more than before I have joined this internship, because through
  <br/>
  the daily interactions with the police inspectors or those colleagues, I see some qualities and also their professionalism being a police [officer]."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Applications for next year's mentorship programme will open on September 9.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Hospital Authority (HA) says its HA Go app has reduced waiting times at specialist out-patient clinics with the vast majority of patients being able to leave within two hours.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "We want to keep the patients and not make them stay in our specialist clinics for more than two hours, which was not optimum in the past, but now more than 80 percent of them can achieve this target," said Larry Lee, the Hospital Authority's manager of cluster performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Launched in 2019, the app's functions include appointment booking and queue monitoring.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee added the HA would continue to expand the app's functions, such as in the areas of telehealth and outreach services.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The authority says the app has been downloaded over 3.3 million times and its user base has grown to more than 2.6 million.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A paediatrician said on Sunday that teachers and parents should focus on helping children with special educational needs adapt to social settings, given that the pandemic had a profound impact on these children's physical and mental health.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dr Patrick Ip, clinical professor at HKUMed, said his team found in their research with more than 1,000 children in Hong Kong that many with special educational needs lacked interaction and support during the pandemic and this has affected them since returning back to the classroom.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said that additional support at school and at home is needed to help these children.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this critical moment when children are returning to school again, we need to pay particular attention to all our children, in particular those with special educational needs, that we should not overemphasise on school examinations and too much pressure on academic performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "On the other hand, we should support them, back up actually to their resuming to the normal learning environment, and encourage them to actually engage in more recreational and also playful environmental activities so that they could get adapted to the new environment, to build up rapport with their peers and also to engage with their teachers and senior professionals much better."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ip advised parents to focus on their children's psychological well-being, by encouraging more outdoor activities and sports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We need to be aware about the needs of individual children. Let the parents to get involved in assessing and also following up of learning of the individual child, so that they could participate in all those support together with the school teachers, continue with some of the continued training and then understand the needs and emotions of the individual child with SEN also at the family setting," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "And also to plan for some group activities together with the children and their peers, and try to go out with those little kids with special educational needs to do more recreational outdoor activities in order to soothe their stress and let the children get adapted to the new environment together with their parents."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A community activist group on Sunday called on the government to make sure subdivided flat tenants find housing elsewhere if they are evicted because their homes fail to meet minimum living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The call came after a government task force submitted suggestions on minimum living standards to Chief Executive John Lee on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to RTHK, deputy director of the Society for Community Organization Sze Lai-shan said the group welcomes any measures to improve people's quality of living.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, she warned that people living in subdivided housing might have to relocate if new rules are brought in.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Actually, everyone wants to solve this problem. But they think about if they have this kind of standard, so some of them, they will be closed or they need to move out and then they need to modify it or renovate it," she explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are afraid they will be homeless."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As well as calling for the government to ensure such residents find new homes, Sze also said the city's public housing supply should be increased to alleviate the housing shortage.

    CE urged to support retail, social welfare sectors

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Propping up the retail industry and providing more support for the social welfare sector were among numerous appeals to Chief Executive John Lee as he held a town hall meeting in Mong Kok on Sunday to solicit views for his upcoming policy address.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Dozens spoke in the two-hour televised forum, including a retail worker who proposed expanding the multiple-entry visa scheme for Shenzhen residents to other Greater Bay Area cities to attract more mainland tourists to Hong Kong, and consumption vouchers to boost spending locally.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Spending is relatively weak. I hope the government can consider distributing local consumption vouchers to encourage residents to stay in Hong Kong to spend. Even if it's a small amount, it's still a gesture," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In response, the CE acknowledged that some sectors are struggling.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although our economy is growing, with the latest figure standing at three percent, challenges remain for certain industries in adapting to this transitional and reshuffling period," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Attracting people is definitely a policy of mine. We will discuss various ways to do this – whether they have been previously raised or they are new ideas – with the central government."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some other issues covered focused on social welfare, including whether a three-tier system aimed at preventing suicides among school pupils will continue when it ends this year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are assisting pupils who are in need and providing them with counselling services. This is correct and we will continue to do that. The mechanism will also be reviewed by the end of the year," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We should also look into how to reduce the number of young people who are in need, including through personality development and raising their ability to handle issues. It's not easy, and this has to be done little by little."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  On a suggestion to set a minimum space standard for homes, the chief executive said the administration will tackle issues relating to living space and environment in the long run.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee is expected to deliver his third annual policy blueprint in October.

    A weaker HK dollar could boost retail sales: FS

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Financial Secretary Paul Chan said on Sunday that retail sales could improve in the latter part of this year on the back of a weakening Hong Kong dollar.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Writing on his blog, Chan said an expected US interest rate cut may cause the Hong Kong dollar to weaken, making the SAR a more attractive location to spend.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said upcoming major events should also bring in more tourists, creating a better outlook for retail sales.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chan said employment income is continuing to rise, which in turn should also support consumption.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He said Hong Kong should also improve competitiveness through the use of technology, and this would bring in new customers and consumption to strengthen the economy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added that the economic climate will remain stable for the rest of the year if exports continue to improve, coupled with a fall in external interest rates and improvement in investment sentiment.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Separately, Chan said there would be risks to making a special loan guarantee scheme a long-term policy to help small and medium-sized enterprises cope with cash flow issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The 100 percent loan guarantee scheme was introduced as an extraordinary measure because of the pandemic. It now has more than HK$13 billion of bad debts. If it is implemented as a long-term measure, we need to be cautious, because it may involve moral hazards," he told reporters.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Police on Saturday said they had arrested 11 people who allegedly used Hong Kong as a base for phone scams involving the impersonation of customer service officers.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The force claims the suspects, who include six Malaysian nationals, are linked to a transnational syndicate responsible for the theft of HK$61 million in over 400 scams since April.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The arrests came after officers raided four offices in San Po Kong and Kowloon Bay.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The suspects, aged between 20 and 67, are accused of conspiracy to defraud, using false instruments, and money laundering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The locals were allegedly responsible for duties, such as renting the centres and providing the syndicate with a large number of local prepaid SIM cards.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The force seized 87 model-pool devices,15 computers and over 80,000 prepaid SIM cards in the raids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Chief Inspector Lee Chun-man of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau said surveillance cameras had been installed in the centres.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "It is believed the cameras allowed senior members of the syndicate to monitor the operation, as well as the workers' performance," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee pointed out that the Malaysian suspects came to Hong Kong as tourists, and were paid around HK$10,000 to HK$16,000 each month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Apart from being responsible for using falsified identification documents or travel documents to register SIM cards, their duties also included managing the modem-pool devices by changing SIM cards in the devices around the clock, so as to ensure that the telecommunication network could be operated 24 hours a day," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lee also said that between May and August this year, three of the Malaysian suspects had allegedly made use of computer software to modify their passports and the ID cards of others, so as to complete the real-name registration for at least 300 SIM cards.

 Ocean Park said on Saturday that its animal care team had prepared a cub-scented doll for giant panda Ying Ying, before her twin babies reunite with her.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The mother giant panda gave birth to one female and one male cub last week, and the park's team has been closely monitoring the twins.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media page, the park said before reintroducing the babies to Ying Ying, she would be given a cub-scented doll.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The doll can help Ying Ying stay familiar with the cub's scent, and also let the caretakers observe and evaluate Ying Ying’s behaviour when she interacts with the scented doll," it wrote.

<div class="itemFullText">
 The Environment and Ecology Bureau on Saturday said it's not ruling out further action concerning Hong Kong's banning of aquatic products from Japan following wastewater discharges from the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In August last year, the SAR government gazetted a food safety order that banned aquatic products from 10 Japanese prefectures, after Japanese authorities released treated wastewater from the power plant.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Writing on its social media, the bureau said the Japanese government had claimed that the water met international standards after being diluted and filtered, and it demanded the SAR government lift the import ban.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The bureau said it had told the Japanese authorities that the release of wastewater was unprecedented, and there would be catastrophic consequences on marine ecology and food safety if there were any error.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It added that the government had to take precautionary measures, and it's not ruling out taking further action to safeguard the SAR's food safety.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It said the government will continue to observe the impact of the discharge, by looking at scientific data and reports by Japanese authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Hang Seng Bank senior advisor George Leung on Saturday said he hopes to see an upturn in the here economy now that the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, looks set to begin a cycle of interest rate cuts.
 <br>
  <br/>
  "The forecasted rate cuts, I believe, will help alleviate pressure on SME [small and medium enterprise] interest payments and this will have a relatively large impact when it comes to boosting the economy," he said on a radio programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a speech on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in Wyoming, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the time had come for the United States to start cutting interest rates, adding that his confidence had grown that the battle against inflation is on track.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said he expects the Fed to announce a rate cut of a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting, and that its benchmark interest rate may be half a percentage point lower by the end of the year.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Fed held the rate at 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent, at its last meeting, for the eighth time in a row.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Leung said most bank loans here have interest rates priced off the interbank offered rate instead of the best lending rate. He said he expected this rate to come down once the Fed had cut its benchmark interest rate.

 A 40-year-old man remains in police custody after trying to ram his way out of a police roadblock on Friday night in Ho Man Tin, injuring a police officer. Speaking to the press on Saturday morning, the police said the man faces seven charges, including trafficking in dangerous drugs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  At a briefing with reporters, Superintendent Tsui Suk-yee said police received a report at 7 pm of a private car driving erratically in Kowloon City and Hung Hom and that red lights had allegedly been jumped and the vehicle driven in the opposite direction to the traffic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At about 8 pm, officers found that the vehicle had come to a halt with the rest of the traffic on Princess Margaret Road, where police had put up a roadblock. Police said the vehicle then tried to ram its way free.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The car allegedly hit a police officer and dragged him along the road but officers, who had drawn their guns, eventually detained the suspect. Four other private cars were also damaged.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The police strongly condemns the arrested man for disregarding the safety of road users and officers executing their duty. It's a very irresponsible act," Superintendent Tsui said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Officers later found suspected drugs in the vehicle, including methamphetamine, crack cocaine and ketamine, with a total market value of over HK$20,000.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Police said they also found a Hong Kong identity card which did not belong to the suspect.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tsui said the driver did not have a driving licence and the vehicle had been rented.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "According to our initial investigation, when the arrested person rented a car, he got a valid driving licence. However, until Friday, his driving license had been expired," she said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The man was arrested on suspicion of taking conveyance without authority, furious driving, assaulting police officers, trafficking in dangerous drugs, possessing other's identity card, driving without a licence and driving without a third party risk insurance.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee on Saturday said the government will continue its work on raising living standards.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a social media video message, Lee said consultation meetings will be held with different parties about his upcoming Policy Address, and he will also be going out into the community to hear suggestions from the public.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The current-term government is committed to enhancing people's livelihoods. We implement in detail and make Hong Kong a better place for living and working," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We work hard in aspects of medical care, child care, transportation and housing, making Hong Kong a better place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured people from the transport sector, low income groups, and the elderly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Albert Leung from Citybus said after changing the tolls for Hong Kong's three harbour tunnels, traffic congestion at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel had been improved and it had also enhanced the competitiveness of buses.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A family living in a subdivided flat said they regularly visited the community living room, and there were teachers helping with homework.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An elderly woman living in Zhongshan on the mainland said the elderly health care voucher scheme had been expanded to cover more medical institutions in the Greater Bay Area, and this was more convenient for her.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Chief Executive will hold a second public consultation on the Policy Address on Sunday, alongside several ministers. The address itself will be delivered in October.

    'No plans to introduce 100pc loan guarantee for SMEs'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau on Saturday said the authorities have no plans to roll out a 100 percent loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) again.
 <br>
  <br/>
  His comments came after the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on Friday announced details about establishing a new task force to help SMEs deal with their loan payments.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The government launched a special 100 percent loan guarantee scheme during the pandemic to help SMEs cope with cash flow problems.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking on a radio programme, the minister said it was a "special measure" during the Covid-19 pandemic, and about HK$140 billion was approved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The economy is gradually recovering now, if a 100 percent loan guarantee is maintained, it would be a great burden on the government. We will closely monitor the situation, but we don't have any plans to roll out the scheme again in the meantime," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yau said the government needs "careful consideration", as the default rate of the scheme reached 9.2 percent, which means the default amount was HK$13.2 billion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked about the SAR's economic and trade offices (ETOs) being suppressed by the United States and western countries, Yau said the government had a determined stance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "There were voices from the United States and western countries asking to shut down our ETOs. But we should continue with our work, and shouldn't retreat just because of some opinions," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "At this stage, the ETOs are running normally. The countries still haven't had further action, so we shouldn't retreat. They're just scaring us, and we shouldn't kneel down."

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The SAR government late on Friday said it strongly disapproves and rejects what it described as biased reporting by the New York Times on the new National Security Exhibition Gallery at the Hong Kong History Museum.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a statement, it said an article headlined "A History Museum Shows How China Wants to Remake Hong Kong" carried false and misleading narratives against the exhibition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A spokesman said the newspaper had “completely ignored the large-scale and incessant riots that occurred in 2019 and the very fact of the failed attempt to stage the Hong Kong version of 'colour-revolution', which have continuously devastated society, livelihood and economy of Hong Kong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It has also deliberately neglected the fact that the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community, and the business environment as well, to return to normalcy. The New York Times has demonstrated hypocrisy with double standards.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The spokesman said visitors had been coming in droves to the gallery, with 10,000 entering by the end of its fourth day, and that it had received positive reviews.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “The untruthful reporting of the New York Times article about the gallery is completely out of order and twisting the facts,” the spokesman added.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 A police officer was injured during an operation on Princess Margaret Road on Friday night.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video circulating online, swarms of officers had surrounded a northbound silver vehicle opposite Hung Hom Divisional Police Station.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some of them had drawn their guns and demanded the driver pull over.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the driver refused to cooperate, and tried to break free from the road block by jolting back and forth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The driver eventually came to a halt after colliding with another vehicle, before being apprehended.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One officer who was hit in the waist was helped up by other colleagues, and led onto a police van.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A second driver caught in the incident suffered neck injuries.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  All northbound lanes of the major thoroughfare were sealed off at around 8.40pm, causing severe traffic disruption.

<div class="itemFullText">
 Chief Executive John Lee has hailed the success of his administration in attracting foreign talent and businesses to the SAR.
 <br>
  <br/>
  In a video message as part of his Policy Address consultation, Lee said officials have gone all out to look for new opportunities over the past year, despite facing many challenges.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "As Hong Kong is going through economic transformation, we have continuously strengthened our efforts to grab talent and attract enterprises and capital to Hong Kong," Lee said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "With a special focus on innovation and technology, we pursue development in new quality productive forces and reinforce our status as an international financial centre, aviation hub and trade centre. We will build Hong Kong into a global hub for high-calibre talent and strive for economic growth and development."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The video also featured a number of people who decided to set up shop in Hong Kong recently.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They included Daniel Seah, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based Digital Domain, an Oscar-winning production house specialising in visual effects for movies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "When I deal with officials in Hong Kong, they are clear about what this place needs. They are also clear about what our company needs," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "A research and development base is most crucial for a company, especially for us since we are built on technology."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of July, Hong Kong has engaged over 100 strategic and innovation and technology enterprises which agreed to set up or expand their businesses in the city.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  They have generated investment of HK$52 billion and created more than 15,000 jobs.

<div class="itemFullText">
 A total of 65 national athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics – most of them gold medallists – will visit Hong Kong next week.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They include diving duo Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, winners of the women's synchronised 10m platform, as well as table tennis champions such as Ma Long, Fan Zhendong and Sun Yingsha.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also among the list are swimmer Zhang Yufei, who won six medals in Paris, breaking bronze medallist Liu Qingyi, as "671", and street skateboarder Cui Chenxi.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But the nation's first Olympic tennis champion, Zheng Qinwen, will not be on the tour.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The athletes from 16 sports will be joined by eight coaches, and led by director of the General Administration of Sport of China, Gao Zhidan. They will pay a three-day visit to Hong Kong from August 29.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Olympians will attend a gala show before showcasing their skills at two demonstrations at Queen Elizabeth Stadium and Victoria Park swimming pool.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tickets for all three events were sold out in about half an hour on Thursday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The delegation will also attend a reception and a banquet hosted by the SAR government, and meet local athletes at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, before heading to neighbouring Macau.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The national team bagged 40 gold medals at the Paris Games, on top of 27 silvers and 24 bronzes.

    Calls to better protect digital platform workers

<div class="itemFullText">
 A union group has called on the government to do more to protect the rights of digital platform workers after pointing to a survey that it said highlighted their plight, especially those who suffered work-related injuries.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Lawmaker Lam Chun-sing, who's also chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, proposed setting up a committee to allow workers to better reflect their views and give them greater bargaining power, similar to what Singapore has done.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said government officials, employer and employee representatives as well as union members could sit on the committee.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Their [the workers'] representatives can participate in the committee and they can discuss the details, for example the amount of each order, and... the time limit of receiving the order online," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In a recent survey jointly conducted by the group and the Federation of Hong Kong Transportation and Logistics Industry Unions, just under a quarter of about 360 interviewees – who are mainly courier or food delivery workers – said they had been injured at work, but only 13 percent of them received compensation and most were not satisfied with the amount.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions said the workers lack bargaining power because a majority of them are self-employed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam also pointed out that even though some companies would purchase casualty insurance, it is not enough.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We hope that the Labour Department and the government can encourage the platform companies to purchase the insurance, maybe the compensation is similar to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, to provide better protection and compensation, to also include, for example, support them for the medical treatment in hospitals or clinics," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lam said the authorities should also look into requiring the companies to offer workers retirement protection.

    Faulty confirmations behind hospital feeding tube case

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 An “uncommon” false pH test result and an inaccurate medical image were to blame for a blunder at Queen Elizabeth Hospital involving a patient's feeding tube being inserted into his airway and left undetected in June this year, hospital bosses said on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  They also said the 61-year-old male patient, who was paralysed, remained under intensive care in a critical state.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The hospital in Yau Ma Tei said a nurse replaced the nasogastric tube for the patient in an orthopaedic ward as part of normal procedures on June 16, before another nurse reinserted the apparatus the same evening. But the patient's condition deteriorated around a day later, with doctors finding the tube in his left bronchus.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang Kam-shing, a doctor who led a root cause analysis panel, said the medics had performed pH tests and an X-ray to check the position of the tube, before proceeding to feed the patient fluids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sample tested came back acidic, which normally means the nasogastric tube is in the stomach, he added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, which is a little bit uncommon, the nasogastric tube has gone via the left bronchus into the left pleural space, which is the space between the lungs and the thoracic cage," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Because of [the patient's] chest infection, there is some fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity, which is probably infected. When the pleural fluid is probably infected, it will become acidic."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Tang, who's also the chief executive of Kwong Wah Hospital, said the houseman checking the X-ray was likely inexperienced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "One of the things that usually the doctor will look at is the tip of the nasogastric tube. Whenever it is in a standard position, then it is one of the factors that we can use to judge whether the nasogastric tube is in the correct space," Tang said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "In this case, because the chest X-ray doesn't show clearly the tip of the nasogastric tube, we think that the doctor involved probably doesn't have enough clinical experience to make sure that the nasogastric tube is indeed in the correct space."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As for why the tube was left undetected, Tang said patients normally would show symptoms only after one to two litres had been accumulated in the cavity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The panel suggested reviewing the Hospital Authority's internal guidelines on inserting nasogastric tubes and consider whether to perform an X-ray examination on high-risk patients before feeding them liquids.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It also proposed having the attending doctor review previous clinical results in complicated circumstances, as well as coming up with a more standardised medical imaging procedure.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Eric Cheung, Queen Elizabeth Hospital's chief executive, apologised to the patient and his family, saying authorities would follow up on the panel's suggestions as soon as possible and provide training and assessment to the medics involved.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Asked if the houseman should be held accountable, Cheung said the doctor was part of the team and that "the responsibility ultimately lies with the hospital".
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The houseman had finished the internship at the orthopaedic unit and officials would follow up according to the panel's report and established procedures, he added.

    HKMA to look into SMEs' struggles with bank repayments

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Arthur Yuen, will lead a new task force to look into small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are having trouble with banks over their loan repayments.
 <br>
  <br/>
  This task force was formed in response to calls from small businesses urging lenders to stop requesting early repayments or recalling loans.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives from the Hong Kong Association of Banks on Friday morning, HKMA’s chief executive Eddie Yue said the new body would aim at helping individual SMEs resolve their funding issues.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “Each case has its own background and uniqueness, and each case could be handled differently. I would encourage business chambers or companies to refer cases to the Authority immediately, if they hear or see any firms having difficulties, so that they can be dealt with by the task force and resolved with banks quickly,” he explained.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In another press briefing, the co-chairperson of the task force, Arthur Yuen, said the HKMA has received only a small number of complaints from SMEs which required its intervention.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yuen added the banking sector has been supporting SMEs, noting that lenders have allowed around 4,000 small businesses to delay their loan repayments since 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He also said a potential interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month could help struggling small firms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The interest burden that they (SMEs) are facing right now is perhaps much higher than three years ago,” he told reporters.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “It's really an expectational issue, the forward-looking, where interest rates are heading that would help banks in assessing the repayment ability of a corporate model, including SMEs, because then they will have the interest rate outlook. They fit the interest rate outlook into their credit models, and that would definitely be helpful.”
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In face of concerns over the tightening policy of property loans, Yuen said the HKMA has urged lenders to complete their vetting requests for such loans within two weeks, unless applicants fail to provide the adequate information needed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) welcomed the establishment of the task force, saying the new group would help SMEs in acquiring capital and promoting Hong Kong's economic growth.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, BPA lawmaker Jeffrey Lam said small businesses still need more support to overcome these difficult times.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The government may consider restarting the 100 percent guaranteed loan and also the payment holiday scheme. That is just pay the interest without repaying the principal, like for a period of 12 months," he said
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We all hope that (in) 2025, things will improve. And I hope as the economic situation improves, cash flow for the companies will also improve."

    'More support, funding needed for HK Esports'

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 More support is needed for talented Hong Kong gamers who often have to pay their own way to compete overseas, said the founding president of the Esports Association of Hong Kong, China on Friday.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Eric Yeung made the comment after 16-year-old Cheng Yip-kai took home the city's first Pokémon GO world championship title after booking his own trip to Hawaii.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Right now unfortunately, most of the games are commercially running for those competitions, rather than [falling] within the traditional sports framework," he told RTHK's Backchat programme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "So I think it's a bit difficult [using] the traditional funding way to fund them and to support them to go to compete [against] others internationally."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Yeung also said Esports can be integrated with other industries to drive growth, noting the lack of a professional league and competitions in the SAR.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Esports itself is not a standalone industry. But rather, in Hong Kong we could work closely together with the innovation and technology industry as well as the traditional sport industry in order to groom a better result for the Esports industry," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Meanwhile, Yeung said the success of blockbuster game "Wukong" - or "Monkey King" - marked a milestone for China's Esports.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The game, based on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, is the first triple-A video game in the country's history.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The major difference [between] those AAA games and those traditional Esports games is the investment. When we are talking about the AAA level games, it's like shooting a movie - we're talking about maybe even hundreds of millions dollars of investment for a single game," Yeung said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "The investment for a traditional mobile game is much lower."

    Plan to upgrade Alibaba's HK listing approved

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Shareholders of e-commerce giant Alibaba approved a plan to upgrade its Hong Kong listing to primary status. File photo: AFP" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?n=-1&q=99&output=webp&trim=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsstatic.rthk.hk%2Fimages%2Fmfile_1767339_1_20240823123627.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto"/>
<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 E-commerce giant Alibaba on Friday said it would upgrade its Hong Kong-listed shares to primary status, opening it up to China's huge army of investors that could potentially rake in billions of dollars for the firm.
 <br>
  <br/>
  The decision by shareholders during its annual general meeting on Thursday will provide a much-needed boost to the firm, which has underperformed the market in recent years due to to weak consumption and after a crackdown by Beijing on the tech industry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We are pleased to announce that the voluntary conversion of our secondary listing to primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will become effective on August 28, 2024," the company announced on Friday.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The firm, which is also listed in New York, had flagged the idea two years ago amid worries about a regulatory drive by US authorities as tensions simmered between Beijing and Washington, though that was later put off.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba has been primarily traded in New York since 2014 and remained dual-listed after its notable return to Hong Kong through a second listing in 2019.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  However, the firm's shares in Hong Kong are down about 75 percent from their peak in 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A conversion to primary status in Hong Kong could pave way for Alibaba to enter a cross-border scheme that allows investors in Shenzhen and Shanghai to trade Hong Kong-listed shares.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That would open it up to China's more than 200 million investors and could see capital inflows of up to US$19.5 billion in the first six months of inclusion, according to Bloomberg News.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Alibaba this month reported a 29 percent fall in quarterly profit as it battles sluggish activity among China's consumers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Uncertainty about Alibaba's future development has persisted since Beijing scuttled a planned initial public offering of the company's financial services arm, Ant Group, in late 2020.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The cancelled listing -- which would likely have been the biggest in history -- was followed a month later by an announcement that Alibaba was under formal investigation in China for alleged monopolistic practices. (AFP)

    'Replace Covid facilities with carpark at cruise port'

    <![CDATA[<img alt="Jeff Bent has revised his earlier forecast and says Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.

<br/>
<div class="itemFullText">
 The operator of the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal on Friday called for the government to remove unused Covid facilities near the site and build an open-air carpark to improve transport links to the facility.
 <br>
  <br/>
  Jeff Bent, the managing director of World Wide Cruise Terminals, was commenting on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme after the terminal welcomed the only cruise ship to dock there this month, the Norwegian Spirit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent revised his earlier forecast and said Hong Kong's cruise industry may not reach pre-pandemic levels until after 2026.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "This year, we're expecting about 100 total ship calls... The cruise business is going to be slow this year and next, as we work our way out of the post-Covid trough," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "We used to have a home-based carrier, a cruise line based in Hong Kong that went out of business and Hong Kong saved its air carrier. We did not save our cruise line... We're now sort of dealing with cruise lines that come from time to time and on occasion, but are not year round based here."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Bent said the unused Covid facilities were a "detraction" of the cruise terminal, and the government should remove them and make use of the land.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Where all those Covid facilities are now, it would be quite easy to have a large open-air carpark there. I think at a minimum, that would be a big boon because we know that 45 percent of Hong Kong people who take a cruise have a car. Eighty-five percent of those would like to drive themselves," he said.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "If those people can drive themselves, then they will not be fighting for a limited taxi supply with the out-of-town guests. So there are some quick fixes that should be put in place."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  He added the government could allow cab drivers to impose a surcharge for pick-ups at the terminal to attract more taxis to the port.

 Ocean Park on Thursday said the giant panda twins born a week ago were gradually stabilising and gaining weight, with the animal's iconic black patches starting to show on parts of the cubs.
 <br>
  <br/>
  But it also said the pair remained fragile and were being monitored by mainland experts and the park's animal care team.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said the female cub weighs around 172 grammes and her younger brother about 168 grammes, and black spots were "vaguely visible" on their eyes, ears and shoulders.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "They are both feeding and defecating normally under the assistance of experts from the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda. The twin cubs are also displaying healthy appetites by drinking up to 10 grammes of milk per meal, six times per day," Ocean Park said in a statement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "Although the two cubs are stabilising, they are still fragile and are under 24-hour intensive care."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The park said caretakers were supporting the mother panda, Ying Ying, with her post-labour recovery, and experts were trying to milk her for the cubs to consume.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ying Ying has been improving her caring and nursing behaviours, the park added.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The mother gave birth to the twins last Thursday, which was also the eve of her 19th birthday, or the human equivalent of being 57 years old. The delivery makes her the oldest known first-time panda mother.
